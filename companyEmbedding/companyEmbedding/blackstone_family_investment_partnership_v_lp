THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT AND RULES 
9. The HSR Act requires certain acquiring persons and certain persons whose voting
    securities or assets are acquired to file notifications with the Federal Trade Commission
    and the Department of Justice ("federal antitrust agencies") and to observe a
    waiting period before consummating certain acquisitions of voting securities or assets. 15
    U.S.C. � 18a(a) and (b). The notification and waiting period are intended to give
    the federal antitrust agencies prior notice of, and information about, proposed
    transactions. The waiting period is also intended to provide the federal antitrust
    agencies with an opportunity to investigate proposed transactions and to determine whether
    to seek an injunction to prevent the consummation of transactions that may violate the
    antitrust laws. The HSR Act provides that the federal antitrust agencies may grant early
    termination of a waiting period. 15 U.S.C. � 18a(b)(2).
10. The HSR Act provides that the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice may
    require the parties to an acquisition reportable under the HSR Act to provide additional
    information or documentary material relevant to the acquisition. 15 U.S.C.
    � 18a(e)(1). Such a request extends the waiting period for an additional period of
    not more than 20 days after the date the federal antitrust agencies receive the
    information required to be submitted pursuant to such request. 15 U.S.C.
    � 18a(e)(2).
11. Section (d)(1) of the HSR Act, 15 U.S.C. � 18a(d)(1), authorizes the Federal
    Trade Commission, with the concurrence of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the
    Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, to require that the notification required
    by the Act be in such form and contain such documentary material and information relevant
    to a proposed acquisition as is necessary and appropriate to determine whether such
    acquisition, if consummated, may violate the antitrust laws.
12. Pursuant to Section (d)(2) of the HSR Act, 15 U.S.C. � 18a(d)(2), Premerger
    Notification Rules were promulgated to carry out the purposes of the HSR Act. 16 C.F.R.
    Part 800 et. seq. ("Rules"). These Rules require that notification be
    provided to the federal antitrust agencies in accordance with a Notification and Report
    Form which is made part of the Rules. 16 C.F.R. �  803.1, and appendix to
    16 C.F.R. Part 803.
13. The Instructions to the Notification and Report Form, appendix to 16 C.F.R. Part
    803, require the submission of the following documentary material in response to Item 4(c)
    of the Notification and Report Form:

all studies, surveys, analyses and reports which were prepared by or for any officer(s)
      or director(s) (or, in the case of unincorporated entities, individuals exercising similar
      functions) for the purpose of evaluating or analyzing the acquisition with respect to
      market shares, competition, competitors, markets, potential for sales growth or expansion
      into product or geographic markets . . . .

14. Section 803.6(a) of the Rules, 16 C.F.R. � 803.6(a), requires that each
    Notification and Report Form "shall be certified: (1) In the case of a partnership,
    by any general partner thereof; (2) In the case of a corporation, by any officer or
    director thereof; (3) In the case of a person lacking officers, directors, or partners, by
    any individual exercising similar functions; . . . ." The
    Notification and Report Form requires the following certification:

This NOTIFICATION AND REPORT FORM, together with any and all appendices and attachments
      thereto, was prepared and assembled under my supervision in accordance with instructions
      issued by the Federal Trade Commission. Subject to the recognition that, where so
      indicated, reasonable estimates have been made because books and records do not provide
      the required data, the information is, to the best of my knowledge, true, correct, and
      complete in accordance with the statute and rules.

15. Section 7A(g)(1) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. � 18a(g)(1),
    provides that any person, or any officer, director, or partner thereof, who fails to
    comply with any provision of the HSR Act is liable to the United States for a civil
    penalty for each day during which such person is in violation. The maximum amount of civil
    penalty is $10,000 per day through November 19, 1996, pursuant to � 18a(g)(1),
    and $11,000 per day thereafter, pursuant to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996,
    Pub. L. 104-134, � 31001(s) (amending the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation
    Adjustment Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. � 2461 note), and Federal Trade Commission
    Rule 1.98, 16 C.F.R. � 1.98, 61 Fed. Reg. 54548 (Oct. 21, 1996).
THE ACQUISITION 
16. On August 26, 1996, Defendant Blackstone, two other entities related to Defendant
    Blackstone, and Loewen purchased Prime from Golder through a leveraged buyout
    ("Acquisition"). (The two other entities related to Defendant Blackstone -
    Blackstone Family Investment Partnership II L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and
    Blackstone Offshore Capital Partners II L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership - will
    hereafter be referred to as "the two other Blackstone limited partnerships.")
    Defendant Blackstone paid $37 million for 54 percent of Prime's voting securities. The two
    other Blackstone limited partnerships collectively paid $15 million for 22 percent of
    Prime's voting securities. Loewen paid $16 million for 24 percent of Prime's voting
    securities, and $62 million for non-voting securities of Prime. The remaining $190 million
    of the $320 million cost of purchasing Prime was raised through debt issued by Prime.
17. Pursuant to an agreement with Loewen dated August 26, 1996, Defendant Blackstone
    and the two other Blackstone limited partnerships will each sell all of their interest in
    Prime to Loewen, if either they or Loewen elect such a sale.
18. Pursuant to an agreement with Golder dated June 14, 1996, Defendant Blackstone, the
    two other Blackstone limited partnerships, and Loewen would have forfeited their right to
    acquire Prime if they had not met certain deadlines for consummating the Acquisition.
19. Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition on August 26, 1996, Loewen did not
    file Notification and Report Forms for its acquisition of voting securities of Prime with
    the federal antitrust agencies. Loewen eventually filed Notification and Report Forms on
    or about October 1996, more than a month after the acquisition was consummated. On March
    31, 1998, Loewen agreed to pay civil penalties to settle federal charges that its failure
    to file a Notification and Report Form prior to the acquisition had violated the HSR Act. United
    States v. The Loewen Group Inc., Civ. Action No. 98-815, 1998-1 Trade Cas. (CCH)
    � 72,151 (D.D.C. March 31, 1998).
VIOLATION BY DEFENDANT BLACKSTONE 
20. The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 19 are repeated and realleged as
    though fully set forth herein.
21. Defendant Blackstone was required by the HSR Act to submit a Notification and
    Report Form and observe the Act's waiting period before it acquired in excess of $15
    million of the securities of Prime. On June 28, 1996, Blackstone Management Associates II
    L.L.C. filed on behalf of Defendant Blackstone a Notification and Report Form ("June
    28 premerger filing") for the acquisition by Defendant Blackstone of voting
    securities of Prime.
22. Defendant Blackstone submitted no documents responsive to Item 4(c) with the June
    28 premerger filing.
23. At the time of the June 28 premerger filing, Defendant Blackstone had in its
    possession an internal decision-making document responsive to Item 4(c) entitled Project
    Blackrose Investment Committee Memorandum ("Investment Committee
    Memorandum"), which had been prepared for a May 30, 1996, meeting of Defendant
    Blackstone's Investment Committee ("Investment Committee"). The Investment
    Committee had the ultimate authority to approve or disapprove Defendant Blackstone's
    acquisition of an interest in Prime.
24. A memorandum to the Investment Committee is routinely prepared prior to major
    investments by Defendant Blackstone.
25. Information in the Investment Committee Memorandum formed the basis of the
    Investment Committee's decision to proceed with the acquisition of an interest in Prime.
    Therefore, at the time of the June 28 premerger filing, the Investment Committee
    Memorandum was one of the most central documents in Defendant Blackstone's possession
    relating to its acquisition of an interest in Prime.
26. Each of the four officials responsible for Defendant Blackstone's acquisition of an
    interest in Prime had participated in writing the Investment Committee Memorandum and had
    a copy of the Investment Committee Memorandum in his files at the time of the June 28
    premerger filing.
27. The Investment Committee Memorandum identified Loewen as an operator of cemeteries
    and funeral homes, and contained substantial information concerning those operations. In
    addition, the Investment Committee Memorandum described the collateral agreement,
    described in Paragraph 17 above, pursuant to which Loewen was likely to obtain complete
    ownership and control of Prime, which also operated cemeteries and funeral homes.
28. The Investment Committee Memorandum had the characteristics of a document required
    to be submitted in response to Item 4(c) of the Notification and Report Form. Those
    characteristics are enumerated in the Instructions to the Notification and Report Form, as
    described in Paragraph 13 above. Specifically, the Investment Committee Memorandum was
    prepared by or for individuals exercising functions similar to those of officers and
    directors of corporations. In addition, the document described, inter alia,
    (a) market shares for both Loewen and Prime in funeral homes and cemeteries,
    (b) the nature of competition in the death care industry, (c) barriers to entry
    into that industry, and (d) the trend toward concentration in the industry.
    Blackstone was required to submit the Investment Committee Memorandum in response to Item
    4(c) of the Notification and Report Form before consummating its acquisition of voting
    securities of Prime.
29. As a result of Defendant Blackstone's failure to submit the Investment Committee
    Memorandum with the June 28 premerger filing, as required by Item 4(c) of the Notification
    and Report Form, Defendant Blackstone did not comply with the reporting and waiting
    requirements of the HSR Act and Rules.
30. Defendant Blackstone's failure to submit the Investment Committee Memorandum with
    the June 28 premerger filing hindered the ability of the federal antitrust agencies to
    analyze the competitive effects of the Acquisition prior to its consummation. The
    Notification and Report Forms submitted by Defendant Blackstone and Golder prior to the
    Acquisition did not reveal that Loewen, like Prime, was an operator of cemeteries and
    funeral homes. As described in Paragraph 19, Loewen itself failed to submit a Notification
    and Report Form prior to the Acquisition. On the basis of the Notification and Report
    Forms submitted prior to the Acquisition, neither the Federal Trade Commission nor the
    Department of Justice ascertained that Loewen's acquisition of an interest in Prime was an
    acquisition between competitors, and, therefore, that the Acquisition raised potential
    antitrust concerns.
31. As a consequence of the failure of Defendant Blackstone to submit the Investment
    Committee Memorandum with the June 28 premerger filing, neither the Federal Trade
    Commission nor the Department of Justice investigated the Acquisition before it was
    consummated. Neither the Federal Trade Commission nor the Department of Justice issued,
    pursuant to the HSR Act, Requests for Additional Information and Documentary Material
    ("Second Requests") prior to the Acquisition. On July 11, 1996, the federal
    antitrust agencies granted Defendant Blackstone early termination of the 30-day waiting
    period for its acquisition of voting securities of Prime.
32. The parties to the Acquisition knew that the federal antitrust agencies were likely
    to investigate the Acquisition if they learned that Loewen's acquisition of an interest in
    Prime was an acquisition of one operator of cemeteries and funeral homes by another
    operator of cemeteries and funeral homes.
33. By consummating the Acquisition before the federal antitrust agencies investigated
    it, Defendant Blackstone and Loewen avoided the risk that the Acquisition would be delayed
    by a premerger antitrust investigation. Any such delay could have jeopardized the
    Acquisition.
34. In October 1996, when Loewen submitted a Notification and Report Form in connection
    with another transaction, the Premerger Office of the Federal Trade Commission discovered
    that Loewen should have submitted a Notification and Report Form prior to its acquisition
    of an interest in Prime. Thereafter, Loewen belatedly submitted that Notification and
    Report Form.
35. Included with Loewen's Notification and Report Form was a copy of a document that
    was also addressed to Defendant Blackstone. The document appeared to be one that Defendant
    Blackstone had been required to submit with its June 28 premerger filing in response to
    Item 4(c) of the Notification and Report Form. Sometime between October 15, 1996, and
    October 31, 1996, the Premerger Office of the Federal Trade Commission asked Defendant
    Blackstone for an explanation of why this document had not been submitted with the June 28
    premerger filing.
36. On November 1, 1996, Defendant Blackstone filed a supplementary Notification and
    Report Form recertifying the June 28 premerger filing. Filed with this supplementary
    Notification and Report Form were eight documents responsive to Item 4(c), including the
    Investment Committee Memorandum.
37. On November 15, 1996, the Federal Trade Commission issued Second Requests to
    Defendant Blackstone, Loewen, and Golder with respect to the Acquisition.
38. The HSR Act waiting period for Defendant Blackstone's acquisition of voting
    securities of Prime expired on May 13, 1997, twenty days after compliance with the Second
    Requests. 15 U.S.C. � 18a(e)(2).
39. Defendant Blackstone was in continuous violation of the HSR Act from August 26,
    1996, when it acquired in excess of $15 million of the voting securities of Prime, until
    May 13, 1997, when the waiting period expired.
VIOLATION BY DEFENDANT LIPSON 
40. The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 39 are repeated and realleged as
    though fully set forth herein.
41. Defendant Lipson was the Blackstone executive responsible for negotiating Defendant
    Blackstone's acquisition of an interest in Prime. The three other Blackstone executives
    who worked on the Acquisition reported to Defendant Lipson.
42. Defendant Lipson knew that the federal antitrust agencies were likely to
    investigate the Acquisition if they learned that Loewen's acquisition of an interest in
    Prime was an acquisition of one operator of cemeteries and funeral homes by another
    operator of cemeteries and funeral homes. He also knew that any significant delay of the
    Acquisition might have jeopardized its consummation.
43. Defendant Lipson was fully aware of the existence and the importance of the
    Investment Committee Memorandum. He was one of the authors of that memorandum. He was a
    member of the Investment Committee to which the memorandum was addressed. He attended the
    meeting of the Investment Committee at which the memorandum was discussed. He knew that
    the memorandum contained the detailed information described in paragraph 28 concerning
    competition in markets for cemeteries and funeral homes. He had a copy of the memorandum
    in his own files.
44. Defendant Lipson provided to the staff of the Federal Trade Commission inconsistent
    and contradictory explanations for the failure to submit the Investment Committee
    Memorandum with the June 28 premerger filing.
45. Defendant Lipson signed the certification of the June 28 premerger filing. As
    described in Paragraph 14 above, he attested in the certification to the fact that the
    June 28 premerger filing was, "to the best of [his] knowledge, true, correct, and
    complete."
46. Defendant Lipson knew, or should have known, that his certification of the June 28
    premerger filing was inaccurate because the premerger filing itself was not "true,
    correct, and complete."
47. Defendant Lipson was in continuous violation of the HSR Act from August 26, 1996,
    until May 13, 1997, when the waiting period expired.
PRAYER
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays:
1. That the Court adjudge and decree that the August 26, 1996 acquisition by Defendant
    Blackstone of voting securities of Prime was in violation of the HSR Act, 15 U.S.C.

    August 26, 1996 through May 13, 1997.
2. That the Court adjudge and decree that the signing by Defendant Lipson of the
    certification of the June 28 premerger filing was in violation of the HSR Act, 15 U.S.C.
    � 18a; and that Defendant Lipson is liable for a civil penalty for each day that
    Defendant Blackstone was in violation of the HSR Act.
3. That the Court order Defendants to pay to the United States appropriate civil
    penalties as provided by the HSR Act, 15 U.S.C. � 18a(g)(1), the Debt
    Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-134, � 31001(s) (amending the
    Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. � 2461
    note), and Federal Trade Commission Rule 1.98, 16 C.F.R. � 1.98,
    61 Fed. Reg. 54548 (Oct. 21, 1996).
4. That the Court order such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and
    proper.
5. That the Court award the Plaintiff its costs of this suit.
