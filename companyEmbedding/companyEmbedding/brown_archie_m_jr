      Milwaukee toddler killed by van apparently sparks shooting that claims lives of driver, teenager Milwaukee toddler killed by van sparks shooting that kills 2   BY  Bill Hutchinson  NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Monday, April 13, 2015, 3:09 AM     facebook   Tweet   email          Archie Brown Jr., 41, was gunned down after he fatally struck a 2-year-old child on a street in Milwaukee, according to cops. (Archie Brown Jr. via Facebook)       BY  Bill Hutchinson  NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Monday, April 13, 2015, 3:09 AM    
	A toddler struck and killed by a van in Wisconsin on Sunday apparently prompted a shooting that claimed the lives of the driver involved in the accident and a teenager, cops said.

	The triple tragedy occurred in Milwaukee when 41-year-old Archie Brown Jr. fatally hit the 2-year-old child who darted into the street, police said.

	Brown — a father of four daughters, including a 6-month-old — stayed at the scene and was shot in the head by a gunman, according to Brown’s father.

	He died at the scene, said Capt. Timothy Heier.

	The killer, who was on the loose Sunday night, also fatally shot a 15-year-old boy who was at the scene, police said.      

	Heier said the boy died at a hospital during surgery.

	It was not immediately clear if the gunman was related to the toddler. 

	“My son’s just been murdered,” Archie Brown Sr., 68, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

	“If I am a man of God and I believe in the Bible, nothing happens without a reason. What is the reason, I don’t know,” said the father, a street minister who goes by the nickname Prophet Brown.       Two people were killed in Milwaukee, Wisc. after a toddler died in a car accident. (WITI)      It was not immediately clear if the gunman was related to the toddler in the accident. (WITI)             

	The shocking attack happened just after 5 p.m. when Brown stuck and killed the tot, who ran in front of him in a residential neighborhood, police said.

	When Brown stopped, the gunman suddenly appeared and blasted him in the head and shot the teen.

	Cops have not identified the boy, but they said he was not in Brown’s car.

	“It’s terrible,” Brown Sr. said. “My son has gone to eternity.”      Archie Brown Sr., pictured, called police when his son was shot right after Brown Jr. ran over a child Sunday in Wisconsin. (WTMJ-TV)   

	Brown said a family friend was in the van but was not injured.

	The senior Brown said his son was an entrepreneur who sold homes he bought and remodeled.

 Triple tragedy: Archie Brown Jr (pictured) struck and killed a 2-year-old who ran in front of his van in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Sunday evening. While at the scene an unidentified gunman shot Brown and a 15 year old deadMilwaukee police say the driver of a van who struck and killed a 2-year-old has been shot dead at the scene of the accident - possibly in revenge.A 15-year-old boy was also shot and later died - though it's not clear what his connection to the incident was. Police Captain Timothy Heier says the car accident occurred at 5:10pm Sunday after the child ran into the street in a residential neighborhood on the 4600 block of North 48th Street in Milwaukee. The driver remained at the scene and stayed in his van while police arrived. Before officers could show up, someone opened fire - shooting the driver in the head. He died at the scene. A 15-year-old boy was also shot and later died at the hospital. Police say the teen was not a passenger in the van.The driver's father identified him as father-of-four Archie Brown Jr, to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.    Police are still looking for the person responsible, and so far they have released few details on the tragic incident. Milwaukee Alberman Joe Davis was called to the scene on Sunday and gave statements, indicating the shooting may have been carried out in revenge for the little child's death.Scroll down for video   





 At large: Above, the scene of a car accident in Milwaukee, Wilconsin on Sunday. Police say no suspects have been brought into custody  





 Revenge? Police have released few details on the shooting. However a local alderman suggested that the shooting was carried out in revenge of the child's death 'I know that the people in that house may have been very, very upset about the incident — the vehicular incident that occurred, but you don’t solve these types of things with guns, and start shooting and taking other people’s lives,' Davis said.  Archie Brown Sr told the Journal Sentinel that police showed him a picture of the victim, who he identified as his son, and learned that he had been shot in the head.

Archibald Haworth Brown CMG, FBA commonly known as Archie Brown (born 10 May 1938), is a British political scientist and historian. In 2005, he became an emeritus professor of politics at the University of Oxford and an emeritus fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford, where he was a professor of politics and director of St Antony's Russian and East European Centre. He has written widely on Soviet and Russian politics, Communist politics more generally, the Cold War, and political leadership.
Brown was born in Annan, Scotland, and educated at Annan Academy and Dumfries Academy, before studying at both undergraduate and postgraduate level at the London School of Economics (LSE). He taught at the University of Glasgow from 1964 to 1971, during which time he was a British Council exchange scholar at Moscow State University for a year between 1967 and 1968.[1]
He has been a visiting professor at Yale University, the University of Connecticut and Columbia University. He was also a visiting professor and holder of the Frank C. Erwin, Jr. Centennial Chair of Government at the University of Texas, Austin. In addition, in 1998 he was a distinguished visiting fellow of the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame.[1]
At Oxford University, Brown was university lecturer in Soviet institutions from 1971 until 1989 when he became professor of politics. He held that position from 1989 to 2005. Concurrently, he was a sub-warden of St Antony's College between 1995 and 1997 and director of the Russian and East European Centre twice (from 1991 to 1994, and again from 1998 to 2001). He was director of graduate studies in politics for Oxford University between 2001 and 2003.[1]
Elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1991, Brown was chair of the Academy's Political Studies Section from 1999 to 2002. In 1999 he was chosen as a founding member of the Academy of Social Sciences, before being elected as a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in 2005 "for services to UK-Russian relations and to the study of political science and international affairs".[1] In 2010 he was one of three scholars to receive the Diamond Jubilee Award for Lifetime Achievement in Political Studies. The award was made by the Political Studies Association of the UK to mark the sixtieth anniversary of its foundation. In 2015 he received the Distinguished Contributions to Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies Award from ASEEES at their annual convention in Philadelphia.
Brown has written and edited numerous books on Soviet and Communist politics, and his articles have embraced a wide range of subjects, including the end of the Cold War, British politics, post-Soviet Russian politics, political leadership, political culture, and 18th century political and social thought. Two of his major books deal with the Soviet perestroika and the role of Mikhail Gorbachev in the transformation of the Soviet system and the ending of the Cold War. They focus on both the power of ideas and the power of institutions, putting Gorbachev's innovative leadership in its political context. For the first of these books, The Gorbachev Factor (1996), Brown was awarded the W.J.M. Mackenzie Prize of the Political Studies Association of the UK for "best political science book of the year". That book also shared the Alec Nove Prize of the British Association for Slavonic and East European Studies for "best book or article in any discipline on Russia, Communism or Postcommunism". In a more recent work, Seven Years that Changed the World: Perestroika in Perspective (2007; paperback 2008), Brown returned to these themes, making use of new and extensive archival material, including the records of Soviet Politburo meetings.
Archie Brown’s book, The Rise and Fall of Communism (2009; UK paperback 2010; US paperback 2011) is concerned with Communism worldwide – from its 19th-century origins to the fall of Communism in Europe in 1989 and its adaptation and mutation in China. This book earned Brown the 2010 Mackenzie Prize of the Political Studies Association, making him the recipient of “best political science book of the year” award for a second time. It also won the Nove Prize awarded by the British Association for Slavonic and East European Studies. In addition to its American, British and Canadian editions, the work has been published in translation in nine other countries.
More recently Brown has published a still broader comparative-historical book – on political leadership worldwide since the dawn of the 20th century – The Myth of the Strong Leader: Political Leadership in the Modern Age (2014; paperback, 2015). It was named by Bill Gates as one of the five best books he read in 2016.
