Sandler Trade LLC Chosen by The Asia Foundation to Complete Baseline Market Study and Offer Recommendations to Strengthen Exports and Product Sales of Timor Leste’s Women Weavers

Posted on August 3, 2016 by Marideth 

In May of this year, Marideth Sandler and Anna Rose Ott of Sandler Trade LLC began work on a baseline market study with The Asia Foundation. The overall project, Women Weaving a Better Future through Better Business, is funded by the U.S. Embassy in Dili and also involves two implementing partners, The Alola Foundation and Empreza Di’ak. 
Sandler Trade LLC previously worked together with The Alola Foundation in 2013 to premiere (and sell out) hand-crafted “tais” and “tais” products of the Feto Forte women weavers’ group in Quelicai, Timor Leste, at the internationally acclaimed Santa Fe International Folk Art Market. Ms. Sandler has focused on expanding Timor Leste’s exports into the U.S. market since 2007, including offering training to pertinent government officials in 2012 and marketing Timorese products to U.S. Fair Trade Federation and other U.S. importers of handmade items.

Sandler Trade LLC’s first project tasks with The Asia Foundation were to develop a tablet survey of women weavers and male-owned businesses in seven rural districts in Timor Leste, along with a roadmap for weaver focus group discussions in each location. The survey
s and focus group discussions began in July. 
Marideth Sandler spent two weeks in-country in late June-early July talking with women’s weaving coordinators and groups, NGOs and retailers helping to produce and sell tais products, local tais product fashion designers, and the newly growing sector of tais product
manufacturers. 
In addition, Ms. Sandler spoke with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry about their work to certify and list each district’s tais designs on UN registries. The Ministry has also offered training and design assistance to individuals interested in manufacturing tais-highlighted clothing and shoes.  The Ministry’s training efforts and providing facilities for a weekend tais market have resulted in the expansion of local as well as tourist demand for tais products, thus supporting the expanding tais product manufacturing sector.
Sandler Trade LLC expects to finish early this fall its baseline snapshot and recommendations of next steps to grow the weaving and related industries.

DC, to non US-companies.
35 Tunisian agribusiness companies, expected to participate at the Summer Fancy Food Show NY June 2016, benefited from the event, to discuss FSMA guidance.


The webinar was followed by a seminar provided by a Senior US agribusiness expert who discussed U.S. supply chains, buyer and customer behavior, and the most effective methods and timeframes to market products, to provide agribusiness companies with the essential tools to succeed in the U.S. market.
The three-hour session provided detailed information to help Tunisian SMEs enter U.S. market and increase their market share in the U.S.

Attention: U.S. Importers & GSP Country Exporters: Nine GSP-eligible Products Likely to Lose Duty-Free Treatment in 2016 Unless Action is Taken by Mon, Nov 23, 2015

Posted on November 9, 2015 by Marideth 

If U.S. importers and emerging-market exporters of certain GSP-eligible items do not act by Monday, November 23, nine products from six countries would likely lose duty-free entry into the U.S. market under the Generalized System of Preferences starting on July 1, 2016.
Sandler Trade LLC has identified nine tariff lines that currently exceed or could exceed the Competitive Need Limitation (CNL) thresholds.[1] By statute, if a country demonstrates “competitiveness”, as defined by obtaining 50% of total U.S. imports in a tariff line or if a tariff line has total U.S. imports of $170 million from a country in 2015, then the GSP-eligible country will lose duty-free treatment for the specific tariff line. The two tables below list the tariff lines and the corresponding countries that are in danger of losing duty-free entry into the U.S. market under GSP next July 1.
The GSP statute allows for “interested parties” (U.S. importers, exporters, or trade associations) to petition to retain duty-free treatment for a tariff line that exceeds the CNL thresholds. If successful, the petition can result in a Competitive Need Limitation (CNL) Waiver, which retains duty-free treatment for a product for at least five years. Petitions for CNL Waivers are due on Monday, November 23, which is only two weeks away.
As the “Duties Savings” column from the tables below demonstrate, U.S. importers have significant money at stake, with duty savings ranging from several hundred thousand to millions of U.S. dollars. We urge U.S. importers and their foreign suppliers to consider submitting a CNL waiver threshold by the November 23 deadline.

Sandler Trade LLC Supports National “Imports Work” Week:  Imports Drive Development and Natural Disaster Recovery

Posted on May 14, 2015 by Marideth 

International trade fuels emerging-market development through growing a stable middle class, empowering women, and creating jobs and sustainable economies especially in remote communities and neighborhoods where the concepts of “hope” and “a good future” are rare commodities.
The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) has expanded U.S. imports from emerging markets – 2/3 of the world’s economies – since 1976. More recently, the Caribbean Basin Initiatives (CBI) and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) have provided even more opportunities for U.S. importers to source a wider variety of goods duty-free from nations in the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Congressional commitments to use trade to fuel economic stability and growth have been successful. The 20-month lapse of GSP since August 1, 2013, has resulted in U.S. imports under GSP dropping by 13.3% in the first quarter of 2015, as compared to a year earlier and a backdrop of essentially an overall flat U.S. import situation. The negative, in this case, helps to prove the positive.
The current AGOA Extension and Enhancement Act takes the recognition of trade fueling economic stability to a new level. AGOA’s trade benefits would be authorized for a ten-year period, through the AGOA Extension and Enhancement Act. This would address investors’ longstanding needs for duty treatment stability so that they may recoup their investments. Haiti, too, would benefit from the Act’s five-year program extension.
International trade – linking emerging market suppliers to U.S. importers – is also a powerful driver of reconstruction, investment, and economic renewal following natural disasters. An important example is Haiti, for which Congress established the use of trade as a way to help a country recover from a devastating earthquake. The Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) expanded opportunities for Haitian-made textile and apparel to enter the U.S. market free of duty.
At first, investment – largely from the public sector – needed to be coaxed. After Haiti’s exports to the U.S. market began to grow, the potential for even greater trade expansion and diversity attracted private and public investment. The results are a new industrial park, infrastructure growth, long-term employment, and ancillary workers’ facilities.
On April 25, 2015, Nepal suffered a 7.8 magnitude earthquake. Many aftershocks have followed, including a powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake on May 12, 2015. The death toll is nearly 8500 people, with more than 17,000 people injured and 2,500 missing.
The earthquakes’ economic impacts are far-reaching.  The U.S. Geological Survey estimates losses could exceed Nepal’s $20 billion annual gross domestic product.[1]
Nepal’s needs are parallel and equally intense to those of Haiti.
Nepal is a land-locked, mountainous country of 28 million people, It is in a challenging, transitional period following the end of a 10-year internal conflict. Nepal is among the world’s poorest countries, with a per-capita gross national income of $730,[2] which is less than half of South Asia’s regional level.
Similar to Haiti, low investor confidence, stagnant export diversification, and growing remittance dependence had characterized Nepal’s pre-earthquake economy. To counter these conditions, the Government of Nepal had just begun to make significant progress. The World Economic Forum ranked Nepal 102nd of 144 countries in global competitiveness for 2014-2015, as compared to 117th a year earlier.
U.S. imports from Nepal totaled about $87 million in 2014, with textile and apparel items comprising more than 75% of the total. Nepal’s businesses and workers had achieved U.S., European Union, and global market presence for its men and women’s apparel, as well as its carpets, pashminas, gloves, and hats. Stable economic growth had begun.
The earthquakes have flattened much of the country, but the use of trade as a way to rebuild has already taken hold. As a way to help their countryman, Nepali businesses and tailors (whose facilities are intact), are donating Nepali shirts for purchase by international consumers with the proceeds to be spent for relief in-country.
The Embassy of Nepal and thousands of Nepalese and friends of Nepal living in the United States hope that Congress will enact S. 81, the Nepal Preferences Act, separately or as part of current trade legislation. Doing so will demonstrate Congressional commitment to use its successful trade-based Haitian earthquake response to help rebuild and attract critically needed investment to Nepal.

Alliance of GSP Countries Urges Congress to Renew GSP Now – and End Record-Setting Lapse

Posted on November 13, 2014 by Marideth 

November 1, 2014, marked the 15-month anniversary of the lapse in Congressional authorization of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). This lapse is now the longest in the 38-year history of the GSP – a fact costing U.S. importers approximately $1.9 million every day ($864 million since the July 31, 2013, expiration), and that has led to canceled orders from thousands of businesses in GSP countries. 
The 24 geographically and economically diverse countries of Alliance believe that the final months of the 113th Congress are an opportune time for Congress to put GSP on its “must-do” lists, either by attaching GSP renewal to other moving bills, or by passing S.1331 and H.R. 2709.
The urgency of the situation – job losses and business closures in importing and supplying nations, especially among small and medium-sized businesses – is clear. The Alliance cites an important example. Maria Roseni Alvero, Commercial Counselor in the Philippines Embassy, pointed out that, “In the case of Philippine coconut farmers in the Typhoon Haiyan-affected areas, they have become even more reliant on GSP so that they can export competitively to the U.S. market. Resuming operation of GSP is a key factor to aid in their recovery from the devastation caused by the Super Typhoon.”
The Kyrgyz Republic and Lebanon recently joined the Alliance to request GSP renewal. In 2013, 61% of Lebanon’s exports to the U.S. market entered under GSP. Lebanese businesses have been especially affected since the GSP lapse. Lebanon’s exports entering under GSP dropped 32% in 2014 through September, as compared to a year earlier. Examples are Lebanon’s jewelry exports, down 76%, and exports of building stone, nuts, gherkins, and olive oil. Items exported in small amounts by Lebanon’s farmers, artisans, and other businesses have decreased by half. The GSP lapse creates an urgent situation for the 122 GSP countries and, especially, for 54 nations that benefit from no other U.S. preference program.
Background
GSP benefits more than 3.8 billion people living in two-thirds of the world’s economies. When GSP is in operation, U.S. companies can import up to 5,000 products duty-free, such as raw materials, intermediary goods, and consumer-ready items from suppliers in 122 emerging markets. Information on the Alliance and GSP is available at www.allianceforgsp.org Media contacts are Romulo Cabeza, Sandler Trade LLC, at rcabeza@sandlertrade.com; and Marideth Sandler at sandler@sandlertrade.com or at 202.492.7473 (cell).

GSP Lapse Marks Its First Anniversary – Unanticipated Costs Mount for Emerging Economies and U.S. Importers

Posted on August 8, 2014 by Marideth 

August 1, 2014, marked the one-year anniversary of the lapse in Congressional authorization of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The 22-member Alliance of GSP Countries has expressed disappointment that Congress did not renew GSP prior to leaving Washington for its August recess. 
The ongoing lapse in GSP impacts the livelihood of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses in the United States and in GSP-beneficiary countries. Since August 1, 2013, U.S. businesses have paid reinstated import duties for products from GSP-eligible countries, costing U.S. importers $631 million thus far, or approximately $1.9 million per day. 
Exporters from GSP-eligible countries have felt the impacts as well. U.S. customers have canceled orders from hundreds of businesses in GSP countries and are reconsidering their commercial ties with GSP countries in favor of low-cost producers. The lack of GSP not only hurts the bottom line for businesses worldwide and in the United States, but also undermines the U.S. strategic goals of deepening economic ties and overall partnerships with developing economies.
The Alliance applauded the bipartisan efforts of the Senate and House of Representatives trade leadership when they introduced legislation in July 2013 to extend GSP. Now a year later, the continued absence of GSP illustrates the difficulty in finding a viable legislative path. The geographically and economically diverse group of Alliance countries strongly urges Congress to renew GSP when it returns from its August recess. 
GSP provides duty-free treatment for up to 5,000 types of U.S. imports from 123 emerging economies.  U.S. imports from GSP beneficiary countries benefit the livelihoods of more than 3.8 billion people living in two-thirds of the world’s economies. GSP also strengthens the U.S. economy by generating tens of thousands of jobs and providing U.S. manufacturers with needed inputs. Since the expiration, American importers have lost sales, stopped hiring, and delayed expansion plans. 
Information on the Alliance and GSP is available at www.allianceforgsp.org Media contacts: Romulo Cabeza, Sandler Trade LLC, at rcabeza@sandlertrade.com.

Sandler to give insider’s perspective in Guatemala on “How U.S. Trade Policy is Made”

Posted on May 23, 2014 by Marideth 

CEO and International Trade Advisor, Marideth Sandler is slated to be one of the lead- off speakers at the two-day CAFTA-DR Forum in Antigua, Guatemala, on May 27- 28, 2014. The Washington International Trade Association and George Washington University are holding the intensive seminar on the occasion of the Tenth Anniversary of the U.S.-Central America – Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). The forum, to be attended by over 200 business leaders and government officials, is co- sponsored by the Guatemalan Agricultural Chamber, the Guatemalan Apparel & Textile Exporters Association, and the Guatemalan Ministry of Economy. 
Ten years have passed since the Agreement was signed. CAFTA-DR has had a positive impact on international trade for both sides, although there is still room to expand economic relations. The Forum’s purpose is to assist Central American and Guatemalan firms to better understand the “nuts and bolts” of how U.S. trade policy is made and how U.S. agencies operate. 
Ms. Sandler will speak on “Trade Responsibilities in the Executive Branch.” As former Deputy Chief of Staff at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and now working on behalf of many emerging-market countries in Washington, D.C., she is well-placed to provide a description of trade policy in the Executive Branch including “White House agencies (e.g. USTR and NSC/NEC) as well as in Cabinet-level agencies (e.g. Department of Commerce and Department of Agriculture). She will also talk about the more intangible aspects of working with U.S. officials to assist other countries’ businesses and officials to be more effective in accomplishing their export and trade goals.

Private investors could have access to a raft of new simple and cheap pensions and savings products under proposals published yesterday by a Government-sponsored review into the financial services industry.Ron Sandler, the former chief operating officer of NatWest Bank appointed to conduct the review, has urged the Government to adopt his vision of creating a range of products that are so straight-forward people could even buy them from their supermarket.This would by-pass current rules which require would-be investors to seek financial advice or, at the very least, to go through lengthy questionnaires to make sure a product is right for them.Mr Sandler's suggested "safe haven" products, which could include pensions and investments such as unit trusts, would have capped charges and no hidden penalties.The recommendation comes after Mr Sandler found in his 12-month review of the pensions and savings industry evidence that it is so complex that most people do not have even a basic understanding of financial matters."Consumers are reluctant to engage with the industry because they don't understand or trust it and competitive forces are not delivering value for money," he said.Mr Sandler believes companies have not done enough to make their offerings transparent and simple, especially in the with-profits arena, making it difficult for consumers to identify the best and worst in the market.The lack of transparency, Mr Sandler argued, has also led to many investors with modest means putting money into funds managed actively by individuals when in many cases they would be better in low-cost passive funds which track an index such as the FTSE 100.As well as introducing a new range of safe and simple products, which he gave a working title of "stakeholder" products after the low-cost pension of that name, Mr Sandler is also calling for a shake- up of the tax regime. Tax breaks on pensions should stay, he says, but the rules should be simplified so consumers can compare different types of savings and investments.To complete the programme of change, Mr Sandler wants to tighten rules on financial advice for those who still want to go to an adviser to buy a product not in the new "stakeholder" category. He proposes that "independent advisers" be banned from receiving commission from companies, which is often hidden in the sales process.Mr Sandler's ideas were welcomed by the Treasury, which set up the review last June. Ruth Kelly, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: "This report sets out a vision of a simpler, more transparent and more competitive long-term savings industry."It is likely the Government will take many of the recommendations on board because it is desperate to find ways to boost the amount of money people are saving because the current working generation is on average putting away £27bn less than it should for old age.It is a particularly tall order at the moment, as two years of falling stock markets, millions of endowment policies not paying off people's mortgages and crises in the life assurance sector have combined to hit public confidence further.Consumer bodies also threw their weight behind Mr Sandler's call for reform. Sheila McKechnie, director of the Consumers' Association, said: "This has correctly diagnosed the fundamental failings of the financial services industry. It shows that sole reliance on the market to deliver competition does not work."The Financial Services Authority and the Association of British Insurers gave the report a more cautious welcome.
