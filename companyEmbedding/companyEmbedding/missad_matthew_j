    UFPI CEO Matthew J. Missad named to prestigious list: Fortune 2015 Businessperson of the Year



    Thursday, November 12, 2015


GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Thurs., Nov. 12, 2015 – Universal Forest Products, Inc. (Nasdaq: UFPI) is pleased to announce that its CEO Matthew J. Missad has been included in Fortune magazine’s Businessperson of the Year list, an annual ranking of just 50 corporate leaders published today.
“Concrete results. They’re what drive Fortune’s annual ranking of corporate chieftains,” states the article. “Of course, intangibles and inspiration matter. But what counts most for companies is the ability to generate cold, hard cash. What follows is an assemblage of superstars who navigated the inevitable turmoil this year and led their companies to stellar and, yes, concrete results.”
He is in the company of leaders such as Nike’s Mark Parker (who took the number-one spot), Apple’s Tim Cook, Larry Page of Alphabet (Google’s holding company) and Priceline’s Darren Huston. At number 45 on the list, Missad’s long history with the company and his success as CEO are noted in the Fortune article (which can be found here: http://fortune.com/businessperson-of-the-year/matthew-missad-45).
“You wouldn’t want a wood-products company to be, er, lumbering—but deep roots help,” it states. “The latter might explain why CEO Missad, who started working at the company as part of a maintenance crew in high school, is leading the company to unprecedented heights. The company just reported the best third-quarter results in its history and its profits over the past 12 months, according to S&P CapitalIQ, are three times what they were just three years ago.”
Missad called it “a surprise and an honor,” adding, “I am just a small part of an organization that has many diverse elements, including a great management team, a strong board, and the best employees in the business. While I’m tremendously humbled by the recognition, the credit for our success goes to each of them. I am grateful to everyone at the companies of Universal for their hard work and ingenuity, which drive our success.”
“Matt has been instrumental to our success for 30 years,” said Chairman William G. Currie. “This recognition is well-earned and is a great testimony to his strong leadership and to the success of the corporation. Universal is a great American company with a great story and Matt exemplifies what we’re all about – hard work, integrity, ingenuity and a fierce determination to be a leader in all that we do.”
Fortune said it weighed 10 metrics to come up with the list, with 12-month and 36-month increases in profits and revenues at the core of the analysis to provide a longer-term picture of each company’s success. The magazine also factored in stock performance, total shareholder returns and ratio of debt to capital, as well as nonfinancial elements like business influence, leadership style and strategic initiatives.

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, that are based on management’s beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates and projections about the markets we serve, the economy and the Company itself. Words like “anticipates,” “believes,” “confident,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “likely,” “plans,” “projects,” “should,” variations of such words, and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements.

Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements are the following: fluctuations in the price of lumber; adverse or unusual weather conditions; adverse economic conditions in the markets we serve; government regulations, particularly involving environmental and safety regulations; and our ability to make successful business acquisitions. Certain of these risk factors as well as other risk factors and additional information are included in the Company's reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    Universal Announces Appointment of Matthew J. Missad to CEO



    Wednesday, July 13, 2011


GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., July 13, 2011 – Universal Forest Products, Inc., today announced that Matthew J. Missad, former executive vice president and general counsel, has been appointed chief executive officer of the Company. The appointment was approved yesterday by the Company’s Board of Directors and is effective immediately. Missad succeeds Michael B. Glenn, who tendered his resignation in June 2011 for personal reasons.
"Matt has proven his leadership abilities, strategic acumen and business skills in innumerable ways in 26 years at Universal, and I think he’s the perfect person for the job," said Chairman William G. Currie. "It is personally and professionally rewarding to me that a board of esteemed independent members selected a man I've worked with and mentored for decades, and someone in whom I have the highest confidence and respect. We considered a number of excellent candidates and many criteria, and the board unanimously decided that Matt is the person to lead Universal to new levels of success and opportunity."
Added Dan Dutton, the Board’s lead independent director: "Matt will lead a distinguished team that includes President and COO Pat Webster and CFO Mike Cole, a powerful group that will take Universal solidly into the future. Matt’s qualifications are substantial, his experience with and involvement in the company’s growth have been critical and inspirational, and his desire and motivation to lead are indisputable. He is the right person to lead the Company with his team of distinguished industry professionals."
Missad started with the Company as a high school student working part time on its maintenance crew. His work at Universal allowed him to put himself through law school. He joined the Company full time in 1985 as manager of legal compliance and advanced through a number of successive positions. He was appointed executive vice president, general counsel and secretary of the board in 1996, holding those positions until his appointment to CEO. Missad is a cum laude graduate of Thomas M. Cooley Law School and a magna cum laude graduate of Hope College. He earned his CPA Certificate of Examination in 1984.
He becomes the fifth CEO in the Company’s 56-year-history, following William Grant Sr., Peter F. Secchia, William G. Currie and Michael B. Glenn.
"I am humbled and honored by the board’s decision and pledge to them, to our shareholders, our people and our customers to devote my best efforts to growing the profitability of Universal Forest Products," Missad said. "Universal gave me my start and opened doors of opportunity for me, and I intend to create an exciting environment with similar opportunities for our hard-working employees, while giving back to the company and its stakeholders. I look forward to working with the best team in the industry on setting and achieving high goals."
