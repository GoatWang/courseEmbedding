The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

It's been built with flexibility and customisation in mind, and teachers will find that after a simple set up, most class admin can be handled through the Apps as well.Currently in use in a growing number of UK media-encouraging schools and programs, including the BFI's 100 Ans de Jeunesse program and GCSE/A-Level Film and Media studies groups. Quickclass offers in-pocket access to: an impressive and growing library of reference materials, filmmaker directories, student film sharing and commenting on. The apps also include an inbuilt taxonomy of dozens of Film Theory and Practical Filmmaking tutorials with in-app testing and Open Badge accreditation, course schedules, and administration to keep teacher easily in control of it all... literally at their finger-tips when not in their pockets.Quickclass is securely password protected, and advert-free. It has the facility for teachers to create their student accounts without even divulging email addresses.
