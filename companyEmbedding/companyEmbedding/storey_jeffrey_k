Jeffrey Storey

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Jeffrey K. Storey (born 1960) is an American business executive whose career has focused on the telecommunications industry. He has been the president and chief executive officer of Level 3 Communications since April 11, 2013 and was formerly the president and CEO of WilTel Communications.
Life and career[edit]
Storey, whose parents worked in the construction and airline industries, grew up in Texas and eastern Oklahoma. He was educated at Northeastern State University where he received a Bachelor's degree with a major in engineering, physics and mathematics and at Southern Methodist University where he received a Master's degree in telecommunications systems. He began his career in telecommunications in 1983 at Southwestern Bell Telephone.[1][2]
During the 1990s Storey worked for Cox Communications in a variety of positions including vice president of commercial services and vice president and general manager of Cox Fibernet. In 1999 he joined WilTel Communications, eventually becoming its president and CEO in 2002. He remained in that position until 2005 when the company was sold to Level 3 Communications. He was brought into Level 3 Communications by its long-time CEO Jim Crowe in 2008 to serve as its president and chief operating officer and was the architect of the company's 2011 acquisition of Global Crossing. When Crowe stepped down in 2013, Storey succeeded him as CEO.[2][3]
Storey, who also owns a ranch in Oklahoma, is married with six children.[1]
