Show moreElectronics If you're considering a new laptop, looking for a powerful new car stereo or shopping for a new HDTV, we make it easy to find exactly what you need at a price you can afford. We offer Every Day Low Prices on TVs, laptops, cell phones, tablets and iPads, video games, desktop computers, cameras and camcorders, audio, video and more. Computers: Desktops, Laptops, iPads and Tablets The first thing to think about when considering a new computer is whether you want a desktop, a laptop or a tablet. If you plan to use your computer primarily in one location, like a home office, a desktop computer may be your solution. You can get a more powerful computer for your money, and you will have more upgrade options should you decide to expand. Plus, you can get a larger monitor (or two) and arrange your keyboard in a way that's ergonomically optimal for you. If you need a portable computer, however, a laptop can still be very powerful and affordable, and you can always connect it to a separate monitor and keyboard when you're back at your desk. As a third option, if you find that you use your computer mostly for email, web browsing and watching videos, you may be able to get away with using a tablet as your primary computer. Add a keyboard and you gain most of the functionality of a standard laptop. Touchscreen laptops are yet another great way to get the best of both worlds. You should also consider the speed and processing power you need. Single- and dual-core processors are OK for basic functions like sending and receiving email and doing some simple web browsing, but you'll want a quad-core computer if you do a lot of gaming or video streaming. TVs If you're shopping for a new TV, the first thing to consider is how much space you have available. Then, think about how you'll be using it. Whether you're playing video games or watching a sporting event or a movie, you'll want to look for a TV with the technology to support what you love. If you're an avid gamer, you'll likely want an HD display to make games look their best. Shop for a TV with a resolution of 720p, 1080p or the impressive 2160p available on the 4K Ultra HDTVs. To keep up with the breakneck speed of today's video games, you'll also need a response time under six milliseconds and a refresh rate of at least 120 hertz. If you're an avid sports fan   whether you're watching football, basketball, baseball, soccer or any other sport   high-definition digital visuals are especially important. Look for a TV with a 1000:1 static contrast ratio to enjoy rich blacks, bright whites and vibrant colors. Watching sports is better when everyone can see no matter where they're sitting, so you'll also want a TV that offers a wide viewing angle. For film buffs and TV fanatics, a smart TV is a great option. It will let you stream content from providers like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and Vimeo, providing access to a huge collection of movies and shows. Cell Phones We understand how important it is for you to stay connected with your friends, family and career. That's why there's something for everyone, with an extensive selection of unlocked, contract and no-contract cell phones and plans available. If you're trying to decide what phone and plan are best for you, start by choosing a carrier that covers your local area, then consider their services and the number of minutes you are going to need. Many providers offer discounted monthly rates that include voice, text and data. Signing up for a fixed-term contract (usually for one or two years) will often get you a great price on a phone, but if you don't want to make that long-term commitment, you might want the flexibility of a prepaid or no-contract phone. You can buy instant prepaid minutes and data at Walmart.com whenever you need them, so you never have to worry about coming up short. With a wide selection of phones, including iPhone and Android smartphones, it's easy to find a device with the features you are looking for. There are also cell phone accessories, including cases, headsets, chargers, Bluetooth devices, car mounts and more. For extra savings on your electronics, you may want to consider a refurbished device. These are typically open-box returns from customers who never used the product. Each item can be different. You can also search for special offers, such as Rollbacks or Clearance items. Walmart.com lets you sort electronics by price, customer rating or features, so finding the right device for you is a breeze. Save Money.

						Wal-Mart

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. today had to apologize after a vendor’s product was discovered with a caption the retailer called “appalling.”

A third-party vendor on walmart.com, the retailer’s marketplace, used a racial slur to describe the color of a product, a protective cap designed to be worn as a layer in between a person’s real hair and sewn-in hair extensions. The item was brought to light by a Twitter user.
“We are very sorry and appalled that this third-party seller listed their item with this description on our online marketplace,” a Wal-Mart spokeswoman said. “It’s a clear violation of our policy. The product has been removed and we’re investigating the seller to determine how this could have happened.”

The world’s largest retailer moved quickly to defuse the situation, replacing the “Add to Cart” button with a sold-out notice and disclaimer beneath the product that said, “While we aim to provide accurate product information, it is provided by manufacturers, suppliers and others, and has not been verified by us.”
This isn’t the first time Wal-Mart has had to pull an offensive or controversial product from its virtual shelves. A coffee mug that said “Got Retard?” a Christmas 2016 offering. The product, which was reportedly also sold on Amazon, was “outed” on Twitter by angry parents of children with disabilities. Also in December, a Black Lives Matter T-shirt with the word “Bulletproof” emblazoned across the chest, was removed at the request of the Fraternal Order of Police. The controversial T-shirt also drew reaction from supporters of the movement. Both products were sold by third-party vendors.
Since its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, Wal-Mart has embraced the marketplace model of e-commerce, increasing the number of online stockkeeping units it offers by more than 30 times to 20 million-plus items.
Wal-Mart’s minimum requirements for vendors says products that are prohibited from being sold on walmart.com include, but are not limited to offensive products that are explicit, obscene or derogatory, and restricted products, including adult-oriented, gambling, government-issued and military/police related.
It could not be learned whether Wal-Mart screens or monitors third-party products to ensure that they comply with its rules.

		Walmart Apologizes for ‘N-Word’ on Website Product Listing	
The company is investigating the issue

Jul 18, 2017, 3:03 pm EDT  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer



 
 

Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) has issued an apology following the presence of a racial slur in its website.

Source: Flickr>

A product listed through its e-commerce site that was being sold by an e-commerce retailer included the “n-word.” As of Monday morning, Walmart’s website included a wig that said it was “n—r brown” in color.
The retailer told the Huffington Post that it determined that the product was a third-party seller posing as a company from the UK. The company said it is working towards suspending the account of the third-party retailer.
“We are very sorry and appalled that this third party seller listed their item with this description on our online marketplace,” Wal-Mart said via Twitter. “It is a clear violation of our policy and has been removed, and we are investigating the seller to determine how this could have happened.”
The product is a wig cap by a company called Jagazi Natural in size medium that included the aforementioned description and sold for $7.28. It took a while for Walmart to get rid of the slur because the company took it off the title, but it remained in the description for a while–the company eventually eliminated it from the description too.
Jagazi also said the product was not sold through its company as it was posted by someone posing as the company.
WMT stock surged a fraction of a percentage.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Best-Selling Product in 2015
Wal-Mart's #1 selling product explains a lot about its business. 











                Jeremy Bowman
            

                (TMFHobo)



            
            Dec 24, 2015 at 9:34AM
            
            





Wal-Mart Stores' (NYSE:WMT) best-selling product isn't something you'd probably guess. The world's largest retailer may be best-known for selling $2 t-shirts, cheap toys from China, and pretty much everything else under the sun, but its most popular product is something more mundane. It's the most popular fruit in the country -- the banana.
Wal-Mart sells more than 1 billion pounds of the tropical fruit every year. Bananas are generally known as the cheapest food in the grocery store, and their low price suits Wal-Mart's shoppers, as well as its convenience and health benefits.
Wal-Mart is not only the world's largest retailer, but also the nation's No. 1 grocer. The company's sales soared through the 1990s and 2000s as it expanded its discount stores to add grocery departments, converting them into Supercenters. The prominence of the banana is a testament to Wal-Mart's dominance of the grocery sector.
The retailer makes 56% of its sales from that segment, dwarfing all other categories and all of its competitors. Domestically, the company does close to $200 billion a year in grocery revenue, which is nearly double that of the country's No. 2 grocer, Kroger.  
An economic moat for Wal-MartIn many investors' eyes, 2015 has been Wal-Mart's worst year in recent memory. Headwinds from currency translation have combined with wage hikes and competitive challenges to put a significant dent in profits. As a result, the stock price has fallen by more than a third from its February peak. However, Wal-Mart may not be as weak as it looks, as its dominance of the grocery segment gives it a competitive advantage as retail shifts to the e-commerce channel. 





Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been trying to crack into grocery sales for years, testing the market with its AmazonFresh delivery services in a handful of cities. While Amazon has been successful in undermining Wal-Mart in a number of categories such as electronics, and it may have stolen the low-price crown from the brick-and-mortar giant, groceries will continue to present a challenge to the e-commerce leader. 
Grocery is a huge segment in retail, on pace for over $600 billion in sales this year, just behind general merchandise. Cracking the grocery segment represents a huge opportunity for Amazon, but doing so requires the ability to deliver perishable items that shoppers often want on demand. Not only do these items require trucks with coolers and freezers, but the delivery boxes must keep groceries at temperature if the shopper is not home to receive them. In other words, it runs counter to much of Amazon's business model, giving Wal-Mart perhaps its biggest advantage over its #1 rival. 

Source: Wal-Mart
While Amazon has struggled to grow AmazonFresh, Wal-Mart is seeking to extend its leadership in grocery by expanding its online grocery pick-up program to stores in several metro areas, including Atlanta, Charlotte, and Tucson. Customers simply select their items online and then proceed to the pick-up center at their convenience, where a Wal-Mart employee loads the groceries into their car. 





Mainitaining its top position in grocery sales won't assure Wal-Mart continued growth as the category is only slowly expanding, but its ability to sell a billion pounds of bananas is a testament to its size and market power. I would expect Wal-Mart's dominance of this segment to continue for many years ahead.

Community Giving

                    We’ve made it our mission to give more people access to a better life, one individual, family, and community at a time. And because we’re judged on our actions, not our intentions, we strive to make a measurable difference every day. With $1.4 billion given in cash and in-kind contributions last year, we give to improve the lives of those who really need it. 
Giving Back







Investors

For over 50 years, saving people money so they can live better has made Walmart the global leader in both thought and action that we are today. As we look forward to innovating our business for the next 50 years, we’re committed to nothing less than transforming the future of commerce. Our everyday low price model and next-generation approach to seamlessly integrating the online and in-store shopping experiences to meet the evolving needs of our customers, have delivered growth, leverage, and returns for our shareholders.

Suppliers

                    Satisfying our customers has always been our first priority, and we simply couldn’t do that without the thousands of businesses around the world that proudly call themselves Walmart suppliers. Our customers have come to expect the highest standards in the products and services we offer, so we strive to positively influence global supply chain practices and collaborate with NGOs and government leaders to ensure that everything we sell is produced responsibly.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
