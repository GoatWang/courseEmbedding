Community Giving

                    We’ve made it our mission to give more people access to a better life, one individual, family, and community at a time. And because we’re judged on our actions, not our intentions, we strive to make a measurable difference every day. With $1.4 billion given in cash and in-kind contributions last year, we give to improve the lives of those who really need it. 
Giving Back







Investors

For over 50 years, saving people money so they can live better has made Walmart the global leader in both thought and action that we are today. As we look forward to innovating our business for the next 50 years, we’re committed to nothing less than transforming the future of commerce. Our everyday low price model and next-generation approach to seamlessly integrating the online and in-store shopping experiences to meet the evolving needs of our customers, have delivered growth, leverage, and returns for our shareholders.

                    Satisfying our customers has always been our first priority, and we simply couldn’t do that without the thousands of businesses around the world that proudly call themselves Walmart suppliers. Our customers have come to expect the highest standards in the products and services we offer, so we strive to positively influence global supply chain practices and collaborate with NGOs and government leaders to ensure that everything we sell is produced responsibly.

Packages move along a conveyor belt inside a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. fulfillment center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, U.S., on Wednesday, March 29, 2017. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. acquired e-commerce startupJet.com for $3.3 billion in cash and stock. Jet.com Founder and his management team wereput in chargeof Wal-Mart's entire domestic e-commerce operation, overseeing more than 15,000 employees in Silicon Valley, Boston, Omaha, and its home office in Arkansas.

Long known for squeezing its vast network of suppliers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is about to step up the pressure.The focus this time is delivery scheduling, and the company’s not messing around. Two days late? That’ll earn you a fine. One day early? That’s a fine, too. Right on-time but goods aren’t packed properly? You guessed it -- fined.An employee sorts packages on shelves inside a Wal-Mart Stores fulfillment center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.Photographer: Michael Nagle/BloombergThe program, labeled “On-Time, In-Full,’’ aims to add $1 billion to revenue by improving product availability at stores, according to slides from a presentation obtained by Bloomberg, and it underscores the urgency Wal-Mart feels as it raises wages, cuts prices and confronts a powerhouse rival in Amazon.com Inc. that’s poised to grow with its planned purchase of Whole Foods Markets Inc.




“Wal-Mart has to find efficiencies wherever it can,’’ says Laura Kennedy, an analyst at Kantar Retail. “They’re trying to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze.’’The initiative builds on progress Wal-Mart has made in reducing inventory and tidying its 4,700 U.S. stores after the back rooms became so cluttered it often stored surplus products in cargo trailers parked out back.Wal-Mart isn’t the first big retailer to tighten the deadline for vendor deliveries. Target Corp. implemented a similar policy last year as part of a broader supply-chain overhaul. But Wal-Mart’s vast logistics network of more than 150 U.S. distribution centers dwarfs that of any other retailer, and the company typically accounts for a sizable chunk of its suppliers’ sales: 27 percent for bleach maker Clorox Co., for instance.Fast-Turning ItemsThe new rules begin in August, and the company said they will require full-truckload suppliers of fast-turning items -- groceries, paper towels -- to “deliver what we ordered 100 percent in full, on the must-arrive-by date 75 percent of the time.” Items that are late or missing during a one-month period will incur a fine of 3 percent of their value. Early shipments get dinged, too, because they create overstocks.By February, Wal-Mart wants these deliveries to be on-time and in-full (known as “OTIF”) 95 percent of the time. Its previous target was 90 percent hitting a more lenient four-day window.




“Variability is the No. 1 killer of the supply chain,’’ Kendall Trainor, a Wal-Mart senior director of operations support and supplier collaboration, said in a presentation to vendors earlier this year.Those variations can be extreme: OTIF scores for Wal-Mart’s top 75 suppliers -- including Procter & Gamble Co. and Unilever -- had been as low as 10 percent, according to Trainor’s presentation. And not one had reached the 95 percent long-term target.Unilever declined to comment. Damon Jones, a spokesman for P&G, said his company and Wal-Mart “share a joint commitment to superior consumer service –- including on-shelf availability.”Aggressive Goals“The goals are aggressive and will require new ways of working,’’ warned a slide at another Wal-Mart presentation to suppliers. A company spokesman was more sanguine, saying the retailer is “working closely with our vendors to help reach these targets. We know that when products we’ve ordered arrive on time, it results in happier customers.’’

That’s been a challenge, though. Under previous Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke, stores suffered from a lack of manpower to keep shelves stocked, and missing products drove customers to rivals including Dollar General Corp., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and German discounter Aldi. When Doug McMillon became CEO in 2014, one of his goals was to improve what the company calls “on-shelf availability.” It has gotten better, although Wal-Mart declined to provide specific figures.While big suppliers should be able to invest in fancy inventory-management systems to get up to speed with the new rules, smaller businesses will feel more pain. Some don’t even know what “OTIF’’ stands for, according to Colby Beland, vice president of sales at CaseStack, a logistics provider that bundles supplier shipments for delivery to retailers’ warehouses.Brisk BusinessThat confusion has created a brisk business for consultants, who are busy crisscrossing the country delivering tutorials on the program.“OTIF is the hottest subject out there right now,’’ according to 8th and Walton, a consultant based in Wal-Mart’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, that has conducted OTIF seminars in New York; Portland; Ontario, Canada, and other cities.“Everybody has come to the stark realization that OTIF is here and it’s real and they better get ready for August,’’ Beland says.The program is the latest chapter in Wal-Mart’s history of badgering suppliers to improve efficiency and performance. It was the first big retailer to embrace bar codes in the early 1980s to track inventory and sales, mandating precise locations on packages for easy scanning. Vendors that refused were kicked off the shelves.“Suppliers went crazy at first, but they all figured out how to implement it and it helped them as much as it helped Wal-Mart,’’ says Dale Rogers, a logistics professor at Arizona State University. “This is just the next one of these things.’’Scoring SystemIn some cases a problem will be Wal-Mart’s fault, so the retailer has developed a scoring system that breaks down reasons for non-compliant deliveries and will fine suppliers only if they’re responsible. If suppliers don’t agree with the fine, too bad: Disputes “will not be tolerated,’’ Wal-Mart says.Watch Next: Why the Amazon-Whole Foods Deal Is a Game Changer











Even a freak snowstorm, like the one that paralyzed travel in the southeastern U.S. in 2015, might not get suppliers off the hook, if they knew the bad weather was coming and didn’t take precautions.“You end up in a situation of, ‘Who is to blame?’ ” says Santiago Gallino, an associate professor at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business. “It’s a tough discussion.”

 Product design can never be inherently distinctive
 Wal-Mart ruling not the watershed case it is made out to be
 In the Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v Samara Brothers Inc. case, the US Supreme Court held that a product design can never be inherently distinctive, and therefore protectible, in an action for infringement of unregistered trade dress. In order to qualify for protection of product design or trade dress, a plaintiff must show that its unregistered trade dress has “acquired” distinctiveness or “secondary meaning”. It also held that trade dress, a category that originally included only the packaging, or “dressing” of a product, has in recent years expanded in meaning to include the design of a product.
 The suit
 Samara Brothers Inc., designer and manufacturer of children’s clothing, who retails them from a chain of stores, accused several other major retailers, including Wal-Mart, of selling knockoffs of Samara’s outfits, and filed a suit for infringement of unregistered trade dress under Section 43 (a) of the Lanham Act, which provides protection in the “total image of a product and may include features such as size, shape, color or color combinations, texture, graphics or even particular sales techniques.” This was specified by the Supreme Court in the Two Pesos Inc. vs. Taco Cabana Inc. case, which accepted, in principle, that trade dress can be inherently distinctive.
 Later, in the Qualitex Company vs. Jacobson Products Co. Inc. case, the court itself made an exception to that rule and held that only one category of trade dress, and that is colour, can never be inherently distinctive. It said that colour as a trademark can be protected only if it shows a secondary meaning.
 In the Wal-Mart Stores case, it went a step further and clarified what a plaintiff has to prove in order to obtain Lanham Act protection, and held that product design, also like colour, cannot be inherently distinctive, since it almost “invariably serves purposes other than source identification.” Therefore, in order to qualify for protection of trade dress, a plaintiff must demonstrate that its trade dress has “acquired” distinctiveness or “secondary meaning.” How a mark can be distinctive
 The Supreme Court held that a mark can be distinctive in two ways:
(1)A mark is inherently distinctive if “its intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular source.” Word marks that are “arbitrary, fanciful or suggestive” are held to be inherently distinctive.
 (2)A mark has “acquired” distinctiveness, even if it is not inherently distinctive, or has developed secondary meaning, when, “in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a (mark) is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.” The Wal-Mart ruling
 In the Wal-Mart vs. Samara lawsuit, the Supreme Court first took recourse to the Lanham Act. It observed that though Section 43 (a) tells the owner of a trade dress for what reasons it can take action against infringement, it tells very little about protection of unregistered trade dress. It also does not speak about distinctiveness very explicitly, but the court noted that despite that, all courts have “universally imposed” that condition, since without that, there would be no confusion regarding the origin, sponsorship or approval of the goods, as the section requires.
    The court also referred to Section 2 of the Lanham Act, which lists the general guidelines by which a trademark would qualify for registration. Though the section provides for registration of only those marks that are either inherently distinctive or have acquired distinctiveness of a secondary meaning, the court observed that nothing in the section demands the conclusion that in every category, some marks are inherently distinctive.
 The court held that consumers, by and large, do not equate product design with the source. They are aware that even the most unusual product design is not intended to identify the source, but to make the product itself more useful as well as appealing. However, as far as packaging is concerned, that can turn otherwise indifferent consumers’ minds towards source identification. That is why there should not be any clause of inherent distinctiveness in product design, as its non-source identifying quality will harm consumer interests. Product design serves utilitarian and aesthetic purposes, and consumers will be deprived of that if there is constant fear of legal action against new entrants, the court held. What constitutes product design
 The court realised that it cannot provide a foolproof manner in which to distinguish designs from packaging, and hence ruled that close cases must be classified as design. This goes against the owner of the trade dress, but serves the consumer protection rationale of the Lanham Act.
The Coca-Cola bottle example
 The court observed: “(A) classic glass Coca-Cola bottle, for instance, may constitute packaging for those consumers who drink the Coke and then discard the bottle, but may constitute the product itself for those consumers who are bottle collectors, or part of the product itself for those consumers who buy Coke in the classic glass bottle, rather than a can, because they think it more stylish to drink from the former.” Even while citing this example, the court expressed doubts over whether a clear-cut test of product design can be formulated at all.
The interpretation
 Regarding product-design and product-packaging trade dress, the Wal-Mart ruling said courts should classify ambiguous trade dress as product design, rather than product-packaging. At the same time, however, it said that in Two Pesos, the trade dress under consideration was the décor of a restaurant, which did not constitute product design. It could be either product packaging, which the consumer normally thinks indicates origin, or else some tertium quid that is akin to product packaging. The Coke bottle example also stresses the point that the design-packaging distinction depends totally on the context. Limitations of Wal-Mart
 Though there are some who feel that Wal-Mart has been a landmark judgment of sorts which has changed the entire legalities of product design, the courts have not really gone beyond its basic ruling. Even after Wal-Mart, the lower courts have ruled that product design can still be generic. In the Abercrombie & Fitch Stores Inc. vs. American Eagle Outfitters Inc. case, the Sixth Circuit held that “only non-generic product configurations that have acquired distinctiveness through attachment of secondary meaning satisfy the distinctiveness requirement of the Lanham Act.” In Big Island, the United States District Court for Hawaii held that in the context of product design, genericness covers several areas. It held that a product design may be generic :

 (i) If it is over-broad or too generalised;
 (ii)If it is the basic or a basic form of a type of product;
 (iii)Because it is so common that it is not identifiable with a particular source.
  The method of assessing the utilitarian functionality of a product design also remains the same even after the Wal-Mart ruling. However, the considerations change if proof is required of acquired distinctiveness or secondary meaning. In the David White Instruments, LLC v. TLZ Inc. case, while the plaintiff sought protection of its trade dress, it also presented evidence of the high volume of sales and revenues and its long-standing reputation for manufacturing high-quality instruments, which was construed as secondary meaning by the court. The court, however, sounded a note of caution and observed that the plaintiff’s advertising, instead of its distinctive trade dress, primarily promoted its functional features.
 The Wal-Mart ruling has also not adversely affected the availability of protection for product lines. In the New Colt Holding Corp. vs. RJG Holdings of Fla., Inc. case, the district court held that variations in alleged revolver trade dress and the clarity of plaintiff’s description concerning these variations did not harm its trade dress claims. In fact, it quoted the Second Circuit’s conslusion in Wal-Mart:
“We do not mean to suggest, however, that in order to gain protection each garment must contain identical specified design elements. We expect that in a product line there will be inevitable variation in the product.”
 Again, in the Carroll Shelby Licensing Inc. vs. Super Performance Int’l Inc. case, the district court held that in a product design case, it is somehow presumed that design does not serve as a brand identifier. Just to disprove this assumption, the court asked plaintiff Shelby to prove that the source-identifying function of the design for Cobra automobiles was far more important than its aesthetic value. However, since Shelby was just the designer of the car which was marketed by Ford, it could not meet the requirement according to Wal-Mart, that “source” must refer to the entity which uses the design for commercial purposes. The court held that Shelby failed to prove that consumers associate the Cobra design with Shelby, and Shelby alone, as a source.
 In the Leviton Mfg. Co. Inc. vs. Universal Sec. Instruments Inc. case, the district court in Maryland held that Wal-Mart has not affected the rules regarding the onus of proving acquired distinctiveness, or secondary meaning, of product designs. When plaintiff Leviton alleged infringement of the “well-known and functional” outward appearance of its ground fault circuit interrupter face plate, the court left it to Leviton to prove that its product had acquired secondary meaning. That is because the court found nothing inherently distinctive in the configuration or colour of Leviton’s product. Packaging or design
 Is it packaging or is it design: this is a question that has irked the courts since the Wal-Mart ruling. There have, of course, been a few cases simpler than the rest.
 In the Eastern America Trio Products Inc. vs. Tang Electronic Corp. case, the court analysed the trade dress for the plaintiff’s telephone separately from the box in which the phone was packaged, and found that the packaging was inherently distinctive, but that no secondary meaning could be attributed to it.
 In the Kaufman & Fisher Wish Co. vs. FAO Schwartz case, the plaintiff sought trade dress rights for both the packaging and design of its soft sculpture “wishing” doll, but failed to gather enough evidence to establish inherent or acquired distinctiveness of either its product or design. Trade dress rights were thus refused to the plaintiff. In another case related to dolls, the plaintiff sought trade dress protection for the copyrighted features of its real looking baby dolls. The nine Reva Schick doll sculpts consisted of a baby face, baby hands, arms and feet. However, going by Wal-Mart, the district court required secondary meaning, that is whether the “copyrighted sculpts have achieved a recognisable and distinctive place in the relevant marketplace, ie, have they taken on a secondary meaning.”
 Furniture, for instance, is held to be within the product design category. In the Herman Miller vs. Palazetti Imps. & Exps. case, the court held that the plaintiff’s trade dress claims regarding its chair and ottoman are based on product design and cannot be confused with product packaging.
 Quite a few other cases have distinguished rather easily between product design and packaging. In the EuroPro Corp. vs. TriStar Products case, plaintiff EuroPro’s alleged trade dress for “The Shark” vacuum, did not seek to protect its packaging, but only the design of the product. Citing Wal-Mart, the district court said it did not even need to discuss the “inherently distinctive” issue regarding the product.
 A few other cases have held that trade dress that is arguably somewhat close to the design/packaging line, can be said to be inherently distinctive. In the Sally Beauty Co. Inc. vs. Beauty Co. Inc. case, where the trade dress at issue was a cosmetic bottle, the district court treated the bottle as product packaging and not product design, after comparing the bottle to brand name salon products. 
 In the TeleRep Caribe Inc. vs. Zambrano case, the plaintiff sought trade dress in a customised pre-paid calling card featuring a specific artwork. The district court granted preliminary injunction, and though it did not spell out very clearly whether the calling card constituted packaging or design, it also definitely did not apply the clause of secondary meaning as in Wal-Mart. Purpose of a product, vis-a-vis Wal-Mart’s Coke
 While deciding whether a claimed trade dress is design or packaging, some courts have preferred to go by the purpose a particular product serves. 
 In the Adidas-Salomon AG v. Target Corp. case, the district court went as far as saying that the Wal-Mart analysis yields “no clear answer” on whether Adidas’ original “Super Star” shoe trade dress was product packaging and not product design. It went on to explain that as with the hypothetical Coke drinkers and bottle collectors of Wal-Mart, a consumer might choose to buy the original Adidas shoes for various reasons, right from utility to simply style. Going by the Wal-Mart ruling that ambiguous trade dress should be classified as product design, it held that “Super Star” was a product design that was incapable of being inherently distinctive.
 A men’s low-cut Wallabee-style shoe with a seven-sided buckle and a strap was treated as a product design in the Jack Schwartz Shoes Inc. vs. Skechers USA Inc. case, without even considering that it may be product packaging.
 In Continental Laboratory Products Inc. vs. Medax International Inc., plaintiff asserted trade dress in its container for holding disposable pipette tips used for medical tests, and claimed it was product packaging, whereas the defendant insisted that it was a design. The court ruled that since the container is physically and functionally inseparable from the product, it would be a product design, and “therefore protectable, only upon a showing of secondary meaning.”
 In Harvard Apparatus Inc. vs. Cohen, the district court refused to determine whether the plaintiff’s bioscience pumps were packaging or design, inasmuch as there was sufficient evidence of secondary meaning. However, the court stated that it had previously distinguished packaging from design by noting that “an item is the product if it is the essential commodity being purchased and consumed rather than the dress which presents the product.”
 The court once again turned to Wal-Mart’s Coca-Cola bottle example to determine whether the plaintiff’s claim for protection of his novelty bumper sticker was valid or not, because the issue inevitably became one of whether it was design or packaging (McKernan vs. Burek). It concluded that since the essential commodity being purchased was a joke on a bumper site, “the proper classification of what McKernan seems to protect is product design.”
 In Fedders Corp. vs. Elite Classics, the functionality of the trade dress did not determine its classification as design or packaging. The issue before the court was whether the plaintiff Fedder’s trade dress for its chassis line of room air conditioning units was product design or packaging. It held that it was product design, as the “undulating curve on the left or right side of the faceplate” definitely served a purpose other than just identify the maker. Since functional components are not entitled to trade dress protection, that cannot be the distinguishing factor between packaging and design, the court observed. Tertium quid of product packaging
 The more unusual or difficult cases have mostly been declared product designs instead of packaging, but that is also in keeping with Wal-Mart’s ruling that close cases should be so. In some cases, however, courts have banked on Wal-Mart’s tertium quid classification in avoiding a finding of product design.
 In the Best Cellars Inc. vs. Wine Made Simple Inc. case, for example, the plaintiff claimed protection for the total effect of the interior design of its wine store. The court held that the interior décor category fits “awkwardly” in to the classifications of trade dress law that constitute either product packaging or a tertium quid akin to product packaging, as in Wal-Mart. Though many would argue that since the product packaging was “awkward”, the court should have classified the trade dress as design, the tertium quid category provided the much-needed cover for its decision.
 There have been other cases where the tertium quid cover has come in handy. After the Two Pesos case, the lower courts recognised that a plaintiff is entitled to claim that restaurant décor is packaging or tertium quid. In the Yankee Candle Company Inc. vs. Bridgewater Candle Company case, the plaintiff sought separate trade dress protection for its candle labels as well as candle display and sales configuration. The First Circuit observed that it did not see the combination trade dress as inherently distinctive, which the Supreme Court later described as a “tertium quid akin to product packaging”. Beyond and after Wal-Mart
 A few years after the Wal-Mart ruling, litigants have altered and enhanced its scope to suit various needs, on a case-to-case basis, regarding protection of trade dress. Though Wal-Mart ruled that product design cannot be inherently distinctive, there is no one distinguishing factor between packaging and design. The “Coke bottle test” and the tertium quid classification provide some relief. To give credit to Wal-Mart, however, the most unusual or difficult cases continue to be classified as product design, just as it intended.
