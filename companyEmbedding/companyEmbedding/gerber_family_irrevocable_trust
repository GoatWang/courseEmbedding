 3 Things To Know Before Setting Up An Irrevocable Trust | How To Protect Your Assets            How To Protect Your Assets Menu       3 Things To Know Before Setting Up An Irrevocable Trust Thinking about setting up an irrevocable trust? When it comes to setting up a trust, many don’t realize the key differences between a revocable and irrevocable trust. Before you sign on the dotted line, there are a few things you should know about irrevocable trusts.   You Give Up Your Rights with Irrevocable TrustsTo distinguish the key differences between a revocable and irrevocable trust, the name says it all. Once you set up a revocable trust, it’s not set in stone. Trustees can make changes to the trust during their lifetime at their discretion. If you change your mind about leaving your home and a million dollars to your ungrateful son, you can remove his name as beneficiary.With an irrevocable trust, once the grantor does the initial setup, the trustee takes over. That means you can’t go back and rewrite or remove the terms of the trust. Even if there is an exception, the trustee and all parties involved would have to agree to the changes. Even the beneficiaries would need to agree. That’s a hard pill to swallow about assets you once owned.Irrevocable Trusts Are Beneficial Tools for Estate PlanningYou might be wondering why you’d want to get involved in a trust that’s so final. Irrevocable trusts have some nice tax benefits for estate purposes. You’re able to place some property within the trust to reduce the taxable value. Some assets are also sheltered from estate taxes at the time of the grantor’s death and distribution.   There are some other pros to no longer having ownership of assets in an irrevocable trust. In the event of issues with creditors, it protects your estate. Since the assets belong to the trustee after setup, creditors can’t seize assets to reconcile outstanding debts. Even in the case of a bankruptcy, the assets will stay put in the irrevocable trust.Irrevocable Trusts Require MaintenanceIt may not be as simple as you think to setup an irrevocable trust. The process is more than just a one-time setup. Irrevocable trusts require upfront and continuous fees for maintenance and to pay staff. The least expensive trust will cost a few thousand dollars to setup. You’ll also have to pay a trust attorney to make sure the trust is organized correctly with the most benefits.Deciding whether to set up an irrevocable trust all boils down to what you need it to do for you. In the end, even revocable trusts transition to irrevocable. After the death of the grantor, no one can make changes to the terms. The decision depends on if you want to have control and flexibility during your lifetime or the tax benefits to work for everyone now and later.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
