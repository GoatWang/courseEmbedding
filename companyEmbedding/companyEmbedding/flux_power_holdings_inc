Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)
Flux Power recently delivered an Energy Storage System (ESS) with impressive specifications.  The development and delivery of a 46-kilowatt, 48-volt lithium-iron phosphate battery array powers a state-of-the-art, three-ton robot for underground mining and civil construction.  The ESS and it’s internals can be seen to the right.
Penguin Automated Systems Inc. selected Flux Power in December 2014 to design, engineer and produce a rugged, high-voltage power solution that could meet the challenging environmental and performance requirements of remote subterranean operations.
Operation of the robot has been successful and Flux Power is well positioned to support any subsequent commercial rollouts.
The 48V/48kw system provides 800 amps continuous current, and is our highest-power solution to date, building on our 24V and 36V storage solutions developed for lift trucks, tug & tow vehicles and portable storage.
The 48V solution harnesses the same lithium technology as other FLUX packs and provides a lighter, more compact and cost effective solution than equivalent lead-acid storage alternatives. Lithium’s energy storage efficiency and density has allowed FLUX Power to deliver a 48V/48Kw solution that is less than half the size and weight of a comparable lead-acid battery, making it a critical enabling technology for state of the art robotic devices.
About Penguin Automated Systems:
Penguin Automated Systems is a research, development and prototyping company and a leading force in telerobotics. Penguin builds solutions for the most challenging underground, underwater, space and on surface applications, using a comprehensive approach to software development, systems integration and field-testing.

48V Energy Storage System

Pictured above is Flux Power’s 46-kilowatt, 48-volt lithium-iron phosphate battery array, comprised of three modules plus a charger. The (2) 24V battery modules (connected in series to achieve 48V) measure 21.875” x 43.875” x 13” and weigh 865 lbs each. The energy storage solution’s Battery Control Module (BCM) measures 18.54” x 14.27” x 4.40” and weighs 55 lbs. The Bassi charging system is pictured at the back left of the photo and is included with the solution.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Flux Power Holdings, Inc Key Developments

Flux Power Holdings, Inc Announces Earnings Results for the Third Quarter of 2017
May 16 17
Flux Power Holdings Inc. announced earnings results for the third quarter of 2017. For the quarter, the company reported revenues rose 162% to $306,000 compared to $117,000 in third quarter of 2016, mainly attributable to a significant increase in LiFT Pack sales compared to third quarter of 2016, and approximately $30,000 of revenue in third quarter of 2017 from the sale of a GSE battery pack to a customer at a major U.S. airport. Operating loss increased marginally to $1.11 million from $1.06 million in third quarter of 2016, despite significantly higher revenues, largely due to the increased selling and administrative expense. Net Loss decreased to $1.16 million from $1.23 million in third quarter of 2016 due to lower interest expenses on the Line of Credit.


Flux Power Holdings, Inc Announces Executive Appointments
May 8 17
Flux Power Holdings Inc. announced the appointment of Tod Kilgore as National Accounts Sales Director and Jason Ladin as Regional Sales Manager, Western Region. Tod has the experience to lead and grow Flux’s sales team and reach into major national accounts across the U.S. Jason brings hands-on experience selling and servicing equipment for forklift customers as well as a detailed understanding of the realities of decade’s old lead-acid battery technology. Mr. Kilgore joins Flux Power from Sanmina Corporation where he served as Senior Director for Business Development. Mr. Ladin has sales experience, accomplishment and a network of client relationships from nearly a decade selling motive power batteries and chargers. Having seen first hand the potential for lithium-ion solutions to replace lead acid batteries, he decided to join Flux and help drive adoption of the new storage technology.


Flux Power Holdings, Inc. to Debut Its Newly Developed Lithium-Ion Lift Pack Battery for Class 1 Forklifts at Promat 2017
Apr 3 17
Flux Power Holdings Inc. announced that it will debut its newly developed lithium-ion LiFT Pack battery for Class 1 forklifts at ProMat 2017 in booth S3460. Based on significant customer and OEM interest in a lithium-ion alternative to lead-acid batteries in the lift equipment industry, Flux will debut at ProMat a more powerful line of LiFT Packs for larger Class 1 forklifts. Flux plans to launch a new Class 1 solution later this year, following the completion of a piloting process based on forklift OEM demand. Flux’s Class 1 LiFT Pack development effort reflects a natural progression of its modular, scalable battery technologies, into larger, more powerful and higher value solutions, such as its Airport GSE battery line, currently in early stage deployments with several major customers. Flux will also display its solutions for Class 3 walkie pallet jack forklifts, incorporating the Delta-Q charger, and larger batteries that power airport GSE, including baggage, cargo, and scissor lift trucks. Flux Power’s “LiFT Pack” delivers higher performance and lower total cost of ownership, relative to incumbent lead-acid battery power, to a wide range of commercial customers including those in the food and beverage industries that use Class 3 ‘walkie’ pallet jacks in everyday operations. An estimated 120,000 Class 3 electric walkie pallet jacks are currently in use in North America, mostly powered by traditional lead-acid batteries. In addition, the Class 1 and 2 forklift market provides an added future market opportunity for Flux of well more than $1 billion, based on an estimated new 60,000 Class 1 and 2 forklifts sold annually.

Industrial Lithium-Ion Battery Developer Flux Power Named to Food Logistics’ Top Green Providers List for 2017
Jun 29, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
VISTA, Calif., June  29, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Flux Power Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB:FLUX), a developer of advanced lithium batteries for industrial applications including electric forklifts and airport ground support equipment, announced today that Food Logistics, the only publication exclusively dedicated to global food supply chain, has named Flux Power to the Top Green Providers list for 2017. Flux also acknowledged its early-adopter customers for their initial deployments of Flux’s LiFT Pack forklift batteries.
“The future viability of the world’s food supply chain is dependent upon our ability to integrate sustainability from farm to fork,” says Lara L. Sowinski, editorial director. “Transportation and logistics comprise a significant part of that supply chain, and we commend those companies in our industry that embrace their role as environmental stewards, while raising the sustainability bar for their peers.” Beyond improved efficiency, performance and a substantially longer useful life, Flux’s lithium-ion battery solutions offer a substantial environmental improvement over legacy lead-acid batteries. The food and beverage industries have been quick to recognize these benefits, and Flux congratulates its customers and partners for their support and initial deployment of clean lithium-ion battery power. “We are very grateful for this acknowledgement by Food Logistics, as we’ve been very impressed with the vision and openness of the food industry to our new forklift power solutions,” said Flux CEO Ron Dutt. “Our LiFT Pack’s low environmental footprint, efficiency and reliability, combined with a lower total cost of ownership was quick to resonate with this audience, generating some of our earliest customers and pilots. Flux salutes our customers for their intelligent combination of business acumen and actions in support of environmental responsibility.” Food Logistics’ annual Top Green Providers recognizes companies whose products, services, or exemplary leadership is enhancing sustainability within the food and beverage industry. Each year, the criteria for earning a spot on the list become more stringent for applicants. For example, the editorial staff evaluates a company’s facilities that feature energy saving installations and retrofits that produce measure reductions in GHG emissions. About Flux Power Holdings, Inc.

	Vista, CA


	– May 15, 2017 -- Flux Power Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: FLUX), a developer of advanced lithium batteries for industrial applications including electric forklifts and airport ground support equipment, today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 third quarter (Q3 ‘17) and posted an updated investor presentation on its website. The presentation reviews Flux’s product roadmap, go-to-market strategy and its updated fiscal 2017 sales outlook. In lieu of a conference call, Flux will take and respond to investor questions in an online Q&A, details below.



	 



	Highlights



	:






	 




	●






	Q3



	‘


	17


	r


	evenue

	grew 162%, in comparison to Q3 ‘16, to $306,000, principally due to increased customer shipments of Flux’s lithium-ion LiFT Pack batteries for ‘walkie’ pallet jacks fork lifts, enabled by the Company’s ramping commercial production capabilities. Flux sold 117% more LiFT Packs in Q3 ‘17, compared to Q3 ‘16, recognizing a greater increase in total revenue generated as a result of modest increases in their per pack sales price.






	 




	 




	●






	Q3


	‘

	17


	production

	resulted in an increase in finished Class 3 LiFT Packs included in inventory of 130% at March 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016. The expanded inventory is expected to enable larger order fulfillment, an improved ability to respond to short time-frame replacement sales, an expansion of piloting activity and greater ability to provide distributor inventories in other geographic regions. Flux continues to pursue ramping production and the related working capital requirements to fund it.






	 




	 




	●






	Airport Ground



	Support




	Equipment (GSE)

	Flux recorded revenue from the shipment of one GSE battery in Q3 ‘17. The much larger GSE Packs supply over 10 times the power of Flux’s LiFT Packs for ‘walkie’ pallet jacks and have an average price over six times as much. Four major airline carriers and two airport equipment manufacturers are currently piloting GSE Packs. Flux has sold three initial GSE Packs during fiscal year 2017.






	 




	 




	●






	Class



	1


	Forklift Battery Development -

	Flux debuted is larger, more powerful line of LiFT Packs for larger Class 1 forklifts at ProMat 2017 in April. Flux is currently developing a Class 1 lift pack with plans to begin piloting in June and to its solution later this year following active piloting and UL review.






	 


	Flux has encountered very strong interest from across the lift truck industry in a lithium-ion power solution for Class

	1 vehicles. This larger and more powerful solution – as compared to Class 3 – provides a significant growth opportunity for Flux given its much larger price and total market opportunity.




	 




	Financial Results



	:




	Q

	3 ‘17 revenues rose 162% to $306,000 compared to $117,000 in Q3 ‘16, mainly attributable to a significant increase in LiFT Pack sales compared to Q3 ‘16, and approximately $30,000 of revenue in Q3 ‘17 from the sale of a GSE battery pack to a customer at a major U.S. airport.



	 


	Q

	3 ‘17 cost of sales rose at a slower rate than total revenue to $526,000 compared to $327,000 in Q3 ‘16, reflecting higher unit sales and initial benefits from Flux’s gross margin improvement plan focused on reducing design, sourcing and assembly costs. Flux’s LiFT Pack line incorporates a range of design enhancements to improve the line’s ability to perform reliably in harsh environments. The design improvements enabled further reductions in warranty expense in Q3 ‘17 for earlier-generation product returns and in-field repairs required to ensure customer satisfaction. Flux believes it has a clear roadmap for design, production and procurement initiatives to further improve product performance and margins over the next twelve months.



	 


	Selling and administrative expenses increased

	12% to $664,000 in Q3 ‘17 from $595,000 in Q3 ‘16. Q3 ‘17 expenses included costs associated with the shipment of demo LiFT Packs to distributors and customers to introduce our packs and increased payroll costs related to new personnel including a Director of Operations, a new Director of Sales and the addition of a mechanical engineer and a senior tech specialist. The hires are intended to support increased production and efficiency as well as to expand Flux’s presence in the lift equipment marketplace.



	 


	R

	esearch & development expenses declined 10% to $227,000 in Q3 ‘17, compared to $253,000 in Q3 ‘16, primarily due to decreased costs associated with Flux’s initial UL certification project substantially completed in January 2016. Research and development expenses are expected to remain as a significant expense as Flux invests in developing new products for the Class 1, 2 and 3 forklift markets as well as continuing to enhance features and functionality of the full product line. 



	 


	Flux

	’s Q3 ‘17 operating loss increased marginally to $1.11M from $1.06M in Q3 ‘16, despite significantly higher revenues, largely due to the increased selling and administrative expense. Net Loss in Q3 ‘17 decreased to $1.16M from $1.23M in Q3 ‘16 due to lower interest expenses on the Line of Credit.



	 



	Flux Financing:



	Flux has funded its

	working capital through a combination of borrowings under a line of credit from its largest shareholder, Esenjay Investments, LLC, as well as through private placements of common stock. More recently, Flux has received periodic advances that total $500,000 on a Convertible Note due October 2018 issued by an existing shareholder. In addition, the outstanding balance on the line of credit from Esenjay Investments, LLC at the end of Q3 ‘17 is $3,325,000 and the maximum borrowing amount was increased in April 2017 to $5,000,000.



	 



	CEO Comments:



	CEO, Ron Dutt, commented,

	“Flux continues to ramp the pace of its LiFT Pack sales and is confident in the potential to further accelerate our growth over the next few years. Our confidence stems from customer, forklift dealer, OEM, and battery distributor dialogues, as they echo our views on the efficiency and total cost benefits of lithium-ion forklift power. Customers are moving from the evaluation phase into the planning and budgeting required to deploy lithium for a sizable portion of their fleets. We believe Flux offers the premium lithium-ion solution in the market, based on the research, piloting and approvals we have secured over nearly four years of effort. We are also encouraged as the leading forklift OEMs are recognizing the role lithium-ion can play in satisfying their customers and driving their businesses.



	 


	“

	While the pace of lithium’s displacement of lead-acid batteries has been slower than we had hoped and remains difficult to predict, we are seeing increasing interest in lithium solutions in the market as indicators of future revenue. In fact, with revenue of $781,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Flux has already well exceeded full-year revenue of $558,000 last year, with one quarter still to go. Though the enormous long-term growth potential of this market is clear, it takes time for an industry to embrace new technology but we feel the time is now. With steadily ramping customer interest and rising LiFT Pack production we expect a substantially stronger sales performance in fiscal 2018 beginning July 1, 2017.”
