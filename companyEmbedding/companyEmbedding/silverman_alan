Skilled Carlsbad Lawyers Handle High-Conflict Family Law Matters
A firm committed to resolving challenging San Diego cases
In 1993, attorneys Alan R. Silverman and Claudia Bravo Silverman together established Silverman & Silverman, Attorneys at Law — a law firm exclusively focusing on family law matters in California. 
Prior to becoming an attorney Mr. Silverman practiced as a marriage, child and family therapist and was employed as a clinical psychologist in Carlsbad.  He also served as the Executive Director of Casa De Amparo, a child abuse residential treatment facility in Oceanside funded by the San Diego County Department of Social Services.  During that time, he wrote and administered a child abuse treatment grant to benefit military families at Camp Pendleton.
Our firm is built on the philosophy that obtaining desirable outcomes for our clients need not involve hostile confrontations or stressful scenes. We address family law disputes from an understanding of mental health issues and psychopathology to reduce the level of conflict and to produce better results.
If you reside in the San Diego area let us help you accomplish your divorce goals in the least confrontational manner possible. We offer alternative dispute resolution to guide you and your spouse toward a just settlement. Should you retain our firm to represent and advocate for you in the traditional method to seek a resolution for your family law issues, and an equitable agreement cannot be reached between you and your spouse, then Alan Silverman is a skilled litigator who can take your case to trial.
What sets us apart from other family law firms?
We have the knowledge and dedication to help you through the difficult issues affecting your life and your family. You can count on us to get results and give you peace of mind and confidence now regarding your future. We are different from other firms because:

Experience — Our attorneys have 20 years of experience in mediation, collaborative methods and litigation of family law matters.
Psychology and family counseling background — Attorney Alan R. Silverman holds a doctorate in counseling psychology and 15 years of practical experience in family, adolescent and child counseling. This background is especially useful in addressing destructive dynamics that can cause parental alienation.
Counseling model approach — Our counseling model approach helps you cope with psychological divorce issues that can arise during drawn-out, complex divorce proceedings.
Certification as a family law specialist — Alan R. Silverman, Ph.D., is certified by the Board of Legal Specialization of the State Bar of California as a family law specialist, which title is earned through a rigorous application, examination and review process acknowledging exceptional skills, ethics and professionalism.
Skills as family law mediators — Alan Silverman acts as a neutral mediator to guide you and your spouse toward equitable settlement terms through mediation. The process covers property division, child custody, parenting plans, visitation, child support and spousal support.
Training in collaborative law — We are highly trained in collaborative law negotiation. This innovative method can be an effective tool for reaching a just settlement with your spouse or partner.
Attention to you — In cases involving mental illness, parental alienation, domestic violence, substance abuse or other difficult issues, we give you attention and referral to services as we pursue your legal options. Alan Silverman's experience as a clinical psychologist and family therapist enables him to assess the dynamics of the relationship and help clients cope with any form of psychopathology affecting the case.

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Biography


                Mr. Silverman received his BA in Psychology with honors at the University of California, Berkeley. He attended graduate school at the University of Oklahoma where he received a Masters degree in Guidance and Counseling and a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology at the age of 26.

Silverman is certified by the State Bar's Board of Legal Specialization and a Family Law Specialist. Alan R. Silverman's focus as a family law mediator and litigator has been high-conflict cases where the conflict between the parties impeded effective resolution of the case.

Mr. Silverman serves as a private mediator and special master in cases involving child custody and visitation as well as high-asset property distributions. If your case requires litigation, Mr. Silverman is an experienced trial attorney having tried well over 150 cases.

            Peer Reviews
            



About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

                After having another attorney drag my divorce case out , I was really frustrated and felt like I needed another attorney. I reached out to my forensic accountant and she recommended Alan. Alan was really knowledgeable, understood the issues of my case and jumped right in.{para}He moved things right along and was an amazing advocate for me in the case. He is super responsive to email and phone and is there for you when you have questions.

                Alan’s background in psychology was exactly what I was looking for! My case is probably the worst case Alan & Claudia has ever seen. They're not just great attorneys but they're great people! I've given up hope many times, but Alan continues to give me hope and support. He understands the “mind games” my ex plays & helps me form a game plan. I've gone through extremely rough times the past 5 years. They're compassionate, empathetic, & honest. There are no other attorneys I would like on my side!

                Alan Silverman is compassionate, insightful, and fair.  His understanding of complex cases makes him a “go to” attorney.  He is available to handle difficult cases.  I was able to reach him on weekends.  He was available to accommodate my schedule.  He always returned my calls.  He is a trained psychologist, so you get the best of both worlds.  He worked with me on legal fees.

                Used unnecessary legal manipulations to bleed me.  Excessive billing for unnecessary email exchanges with opposing attorneys that ended with little being resolved. Encouraged a very agressive legal attack which cost me a bundle.  Final judgement is incomplete and a mod-podge of documents. Failed to fully execute legal negotiations with opposing council. Repeatedly claimed he could get my ex-spouse to cover my legal fees, which did not happen.

About Alan


When it comes to helping people with their finances, a cookie cutter approach doesn't work.  Everyone's different, so listening to you and discussing your hopes and dreams allows us to focus on what's important.






I'm Most Proud Of: Hearing from clients about how our team helped improve their life. There's nothing better!


 














Solutions
Life Happens. Being prepared makes all the difference.
You have options when it comes to your financial future - no matter your life situation.


 



Living in Retirement
Discover how our annuity options can help you create income for retirement and may be right for your personal financial needs. A Traditional or Roth IRA can also be an option to help you save for the future with either tax-free growth or on a tax-deferred basis.
 



Protecting Your Family and Greatest Assets
Whether you are recently married, buying a house, taking care of a loved one or preparing to retire, each new stage of life is exciting and uncertain. Ensure you’re protected with life, auto, home, long-term care and disability insurance.
 



Saving for Retirement
Get help reaching your retirement goals on your terms with an annuity, 401(k) or IRA. An annuity can be a way to provide retirement income and defer year-end taxes, and an IRA and 401(k) give you options to save for the next phase of your life. See if one or all of these retirement vehicles are right for you.

About Silverman's









 

HOME
UNIFORMS FOR KIDS
CONTACT





    	Since 1946, Silverman’s always focused on serving the local community. Silverman's was known for having everything local customers needed at the lowest possible prices, including many items that couldn’t be found anywhere else.

Sadly in 2015, after serious consideration, the last of the Silverman's stores has closed.  

Silverman’s began as Surplus Value Center, a single store at 46th and St. Clair. In 1955, it moved, and adopted the name Surplus City, then in 1969., the name was changed to Silverman’s to reflect it's full line of discount merchandise. 

It all started just after WWII, when Marcus Silverman enlisted the help of his brothers, Dave, Irv and Sid, and began selling government surplus goods. Customers came from all over the city for everyday items (which, back then, were often hard to find) like underwear, socks, shirts, and rain wear, as well as specialty items, like telescopes, binoculars and tools. 

As government surplus goods diminished and consumer products became more widely available, more family joined the business (Sanford, Maury, Charlotte, Evelyn, Selma, Ralph, Lenny and Josh).  The Silverman family went all over to purchase items their customers wanted. As times changed, they added more household goods, fashion clothing, school uniforms and 1,000's of other items to their selection of products.

Through the hard work of the company's excellent staff and the loyalty of its customers, Silverman's eventually expanded to 8 stores.  The staff was proud of the fact that they out lived many of the big chains they once competed against, like Ames, Cooks, Gaylords, Gold Circle, Hills, Uncle Bills, Zayres, and others.

It is bitter sweet that Silverman's is closing after all these years, but Alan Silverman has been working at Silverman's all his adult life, and has decided to take it easier.  In closing Alan thanked all of Silverman's customers and associates for their support and friendship over the years. He said, " I plan to continue to be a major supporter of Uniforms For Kids, because I believe every child deserves to go to school dressed to succeed.  I am looking forward to spending more time on Uniforms For Kids in the future and enjoying my retirement."

These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
