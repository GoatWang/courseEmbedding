Who We Are


High Value-Added Investment Firm

Active Strategies
Autonomous Franchises
Process-Driven Results



                                        We focus exclusively on active, high value-added investment strategies where experienced investment professionals pursue superior results through a combination of original thinking and a disciplined approach. We have a strong philosophical belief in the autonomy of each of our investment teams. We provide each investment team with ample resources and support, without imposing a centralized research function. Each investment strategy is focused on an area that we believe provides opportunities to generate returns in excess of the relevant benchmarks.
                                    




Talent-Driven Business

Designed for Investment Talent to Thrive
Managed by Business Professionals
Structured to Align Interests



                                        Our business model is designed to attract, develop and retain talented investment professionals by allowing them to focus on portfolio management in an environment conducive to producing their best work on a consistent, long-term basis. Our experienced business leadership team supports our investment management capabilities by managing a centralized infrastructure, which allows our investment professionals to focus primarily on making investment decisions and generating returns for our clients. We ensure that our interests are aligned with the long-term interests of our clients. Our investment professionals' incentives are directly tied to the growth in client capital generated by the strategies they manage; additionally, the leaders of our investment teams have meaningful capital invested alongside clients in those strategies and are equity partners in the firm.
                                    




Thoughtful Growth

Active Talent Identification
Entrepreneurial Commitment
Focus on Long-Term Global Demand



                                        Firm evolution requires thoughtful growth. A lack of growth or growth for growth's sake can make a business unattractive to investment talent. Our entrepreneurial mindset keeps us actively looking for ways to maximize long-term career opportunities for our existing investment professionals and make our business attractive to prospective investment talent. It also ensures we stay committed to providing investment solutions that are aligned with long-term global trends and that are relevant to our clients.

Artisan Partners Funds, Inc. - Artisan Mid Cap Fund is an open-ended equity mutual fund launched and managed by Artisan Partners Limited Partnership. It invests in the public equity markets of the United States. The fund seeks to invest in the stocks of companies operating across diversified sectors. It invests in the growth stocks of mid-cap companies, with market capitalization greater than the market capitalization of the smallest company in the Russell Midcap Index and less than three times the weighted average market capitalization of companies in that Index and maintains a weighted average market capitalization of not more than 1.5 times the weighted average market capitalization of the companies included in the index. The fund employs fundamental analysis with a bottom-up stock picking approach focusing on factors such as companies that have franchise characteristics like low cost production capability, possession of a proprietary asset, dominant market share, or a defensible brand name, are benefiting from an accelerating profit cycle and are trading at a discount to private market value, are well positioned for long-term growth, which is driven by demand for their products and services at an early enough stage in their profit cycle to benefit from the increased cash flows produced by the emerging profit cycle to create its portfolio. It employs garden, crop, and harvest style of investing, which is divided into three parts: garden investments are small positions in the early part of their profit cycle that may warrant more sizeable allocations as their profit cycle accelerates, crop investments are positions that are being increased to a full weight as they are moving through the strongest part of their profit cycles, harvest investments are positions that are being reduced as they near estimates of full valuation or their profit cycles begin to decelerate to create its portfolio. The fund benchmarks the performance of its portfolio against the Russell Midcap Growth Index and the Russell Midcap Index. It conducts in-house research to create its portfolio. The fund was formerly known as Artisan Funds, Inc. - Artisan Mid Cap Fund. Artisan Partners Funds, Inc. - Artisan Mid Cap Fund was formed on June 27, 1997 and is domiciled in the United States.
