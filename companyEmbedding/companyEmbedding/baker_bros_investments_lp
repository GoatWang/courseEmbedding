What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

The renowned healthcare investing firm has slowly amassed a huge position in Seattle Genetics. Should investors consider riding on their coattails?

            Sep 5, 2015 at 8:07AM
            
            





The $11.4 billion healthcare specialist investing firm co-managed by Felix and Julian Baker, known as the Baker Bros. Advisors, is regarded as one of the best when it comes to picking stocks in this volatile sector -- and for good reason. The Baker Bros., for instance, have had the rare insight to gobble up shares in former small-cap companies like Acadia Pharmaceuticals, bluebird bio, and Synageva BioPharma Corp. before they ripped higher. So when this fund starts to accumulate shares in a company, investors may want to take heed. 
On that note, the Baker Bros. have slowly been building a massive position in the antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, specialist Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ:SGEN) for a few years now, even adding almost 2 million more shares to their holdings in the second quarter of 2015, according to the quarterly 13Fs filed with the SEC. In total, the firm's holdings in the drugmaker are valued at around $1.5 billion, making it the largest stakeholder in the company. 
Given their significant financial interest in Seattle Genetics, and the fact that Felix Baker sits on its board of directors , I think it's worth the effort to consider if investors should add this stock to their portfolios. So let's take a look at what Seattle Genetics has to offer investors as a mid-cap biotech stock. 
Seattle Genetics is specializing in an emerging field of novel cancer treatmentsBefore immunotherapies stole the headlines and perhaps the show as well, ADCs were believed to be one of the most promising new classes of cancer treatments coming online. After several cases of off-site toxicity cropped up in clinical studies for some experimental ADCs, though, the investing community seemingly forgot about them overnight.
But the pharma industry has not forgotten, not by a long shot. By contrast, several pharma companies have been working vigorously on improving the technology to make it both safer and more effective across a wide variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies.  





This work has so far spawned several regulatory approvals for Seattle Genetics' Adcetris for various forms of blood cancer and Roche's Kadcyla for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. 

Source: Seattle Genetics.

Commercially speaking, these two drugs have also been fairly successful as novel oncology treatments. Adcetris' second-quarter sales, for example, grew to $55 million, compared to approximately $44 million for the same period a year ago. And not to be outdone, Kadcyla posted a monstrous 65% sales growth rate in the first half of 2015, relative to the same period a year ago. Perhaps the key takeaway from these figures is that the medical community appears to be deeply interested in employing ADCs in the fight against cancer. 
Is Seattle Genetics a buy?An easy criticism to lob at Seattle Genetics is that it's a smaller biopharma trying to compete against the big boys like Pfizer and Roche, among others. But a deeper look at the company shows that it is a central player in the ADC field, with major licensing agreements with AbbVie, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Roche, and many others, already in play. In short, big pharma and biotech appear to be rather optimistic about Seattle Genetics' drug development platform moving forward. 
So what investors need to understand is that ADCs are probably not going to be displaced by the suite of checkpoint inhibitors grabbing the headlines right now, evinced in part, by big pharma's major investment in this technology. And the real focus is to refine the ADC platform as a whole.





Turning to the question of whether Seattle Genetics' stock is a buy or not, I think the answer is a "yes." From a fundamental perspective, the drugmaker may not look like a compelling value buy -- largely because of its huge and growing clinical program that is keeping the company's ledger in the red.
But its massive core clinical program, that sports 8 clinical candidates being assessed across a whopping 17 indications, has the potential to generate multiple products with each one capable of raking in hundreds of millions in annual revenue. And then there's Seattle Genetics' wide diversity of research collaborations that also could lead to a substantial upswing in royalty payments.
All told, Seattle Genetics' wide diversity of clinical activities gives it several shots on goal in terms of turning the company into a profitable operation, which is probably one of the main reasons why the Baker Bros. are so keen on this mid-cap biotech stock.
