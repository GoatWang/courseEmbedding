SailingStone Capital Partners Outlines New Proxy Voting Guidelines
        																																						
              











 News provided by
SailingStone Capital Partners LLC

 Share this article




























































SAN FRANCISCO, April 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SailingStone Capital Partners LLC ("SailingStone" or "the Company") announced today that it has updated its proxy voting guidelines. A copy of the Company's revised guidelines can be found at http://www.sailingstonecapital.com/resources.html.








The new framework, which incorporates ISS' Sustainability Policies, is based on feedback that SailingStone has received from its investment partners and portfolio companies on important governance matters. SailingStone anticipates that the guidelines will continue to evolve as corporate governance standards change and as the Company receives additional input from investors, management teams, and independent directors.
One point of emphasis in the Company's new framework is incentive compensation. SailingStone is concerned that the incentive compensation programs of many companies in the natural resource industry continue to reward top-line growth over other measures that are tied more closely to value creation – often at the expense of shareholders. The Company believes that the poor returns on capital and the weak balance sheets in the sector reflect the misalignment that frequently exists between shareholders and management. Thus, SailingStone will consider the effectiveness of compensation plans in linking pay with returns on capital and value creation, as well as the degree to which potentially value-destructive production and reserve-based growth targets are used, when deciding how to vote for directors and incentive programs in the future.
Another area of focus for SailingStone in its proxy voting guidelines is transparency. The Company believes that the perception of the natural resource sector has been negatively impacted by the lack of transparency that many companies provide for investors regarding the returns that are being generated on shareholder capital. SailingStone further argues that the potentially misleading practices of providing selective project/well disclosures and "half-cycle" returns have only served to further erode investor confidence. The Company expects boards to provide their owners with a review of the estimated returns that were generated on shareholder capital when evaluating the performance of the company and management compensation. Going forward, SailingStone will consider the transparency that companies provide regarding returns on capital when deciding how to vote for directors.
Lastly, SailingStone is of the view that good corporate governance practices should include a formal shareholder engagement program that provides shareholders with an opportunity to speak with independent directors at least once per year. The Company does not believe that it is appropriate to leave shareholder engagement to executives alone given the potential conflicts of interest that may exist. SailingStone will consider the effectiveness of shareholder engagement initiatives when deciding whether to vote for or against directors.
SailingStone will support policies and proposals which the Company believes will help to create economic value for shareholders, and is committed to providing transparency into the Company's proxy voting guidelines moving forward.
About SailingStone Capital Partners LLCSailingStone Capital Partners is a 100% employee-owned investment advisory firm focused exclusively on providing investment solutions in the global natural resource space. Based in San Francisco, SailingStone manages concentrated, long-only natural resource equity portfolios for investors.

Overview
Principles
Philosophy




Principles
PARTNERSHIP

We view the relationship between our clients, portfolio companies and employees as a partnership. We work with management teams that we believe will be good stewards of our clients' capital and we seek to ensure that the objectives of our employees and portfolio companies are consistent with the goals of our investment partners.

ALIGNMENT

We seek to avoid conflicts of interests by aligning the interests of our investment partners with our investment team and our portfolio company management teams. We attempt to do this by identifying management teams that we believe are focused on creating economic value and managing risks. In addition, our own incentives are tied to preserving capital and generating attractive long-term returns. Our alignment is reinforced by our own investments in the strategy.

INTEGRITY

We strive to operate under the highest ethical standards. We expect the same of our portfolio companies, particularly as it relates to corporate governance and their handling of health, safety, and environmental issues. We are not willing to sacrifice the reputation of our partners or our firm for short-term gains.

INTELLECTUAL HONESTY

We let facts drive our decision-making process and embrace opportunities to hear different perspectives as a means to improve as investors and business partners. We work in teams to reduce bias and increase productive tension. We promote a culture of open debate, focused on assumptions, not outcomes or individuals. We are candid, curious and supportive.

ACCOUNTABILITY

We hold ourselves and each other accountable for our areas of responsibility. Anything more, or less, than 100% accountability reduces our effectiveness as individuals and as a team.  We are transparent about our investment results and the drivers of returns, both good and bad.
