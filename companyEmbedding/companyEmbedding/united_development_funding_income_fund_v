United Development Funding Income Fund V
UNITED DEVELOPMENT FUNDING INCOME FUND V INVESTIGATION ALERT – Andrews & Springer LLC Announces That It Is Investigating United Development Funding Income Fund V For Potential Securities Fraud and Breach of Fiduciary Duty
(Wilmington, DE) Andrews & Springer LLC, a boutique securities class action law firm focused on representing shareholders nationwide, is investigating potential securities violations and breach of fiduciary duty claims against United Development Funding Income Fund V (“UDF V”).
On November 24, 2015 UDF V’s independent registered public accounting firm "declined to stand for reappointment." And on December 10, 2015, a letter and thesis was posted to the Internet that raised "red flags" and put forward "serious questions about (i) the legitimacy of the financial and other relationships between affiliated entities and individuals and (ii) apparent accounting irregularities."
On February 18, 2016, the FBI raided the Dallas offices of UDF V affiliate United Development Funding IV (“UDF IV”). As a result, the Nasdaq temporarily halted trading of UDF IV’s shares.
If you currently own shares of UDF V and want to receive additional information and protect your investments free of charge, please visit us at http://www.andrewsspringer.com/cases-investigations/united-development-funding-income-fund-V-class-action-investigation or contact Craig J.
