Stitch Fix has confidentially filed to go public: report
              
              Stitch Fix, a subscription clothing service, has filed confidentially to go public, according to TechCrunch, citing sources. The company has been rumored to be going public for months, with Reuters reporting in May that the company had hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to underwrite the offering. Under the JOBS Act, companies are able to file confidentially before releasing a public prospectus. In late June, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to allow confidential filing for all companies, rather than the previous standard of companies with annual revenue of less than $1 billion. Stitch Fix would be another test of a subscription service model, after Blue Apron Holdings Inc.'s  offering earlier this month. Shares of Blue Apron have fallen 28% month-to-date, while the S&P 500  has gained 2%.

Atlantic Media selling ownership stake to organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs
              
              Emerson Collective, founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of late Apple founder Steve Jobs, is acquiring a majority ownership stake in The Atlantic. According to a news release on Friday Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley told staff of the deal, which includes its flagship magazine, digital properties, live events business and consulting services. Bradley, through Atlantic Media, will hold a minority stake and continue to run The Atlantic for the next three to five years. In a letter to The Atlantic staff Bradley said, "Against the odds, The Atlantic is prospering. While I will stay at the helm some years, the most consequential decision of my career now is behind me: Who next will take stewardship of this 160-year-old national treasure? To me, the answer, in the form of Laurene, feels incomparably right." The terms of the deal were not disclosed. In the 18 years since Bradley acquired the magazine from Mortimer Zuckerman, digital readership has grown to a monthly average of 33 million unique visitors from 2 million in 2009, and it generates profits above $10 million per year after recording losses of more than $10 million a year in Bradley's early days. About 20% of the magazine's revenue comes from print advertising with 80% coming in digital advertising.

Goodyear Tire's stock dives after slashed profit outlook offsets in-line earnings
              
              Shares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  plunged 9.3% in premarket trade Friday, after the tire maker slashed its 2017 profit outlook. Net profit for the quarter to June 30 fell to $147 million, or 58 cents a share, from $202 million, or 75 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 70 cents, matching the FactSet consensus. Revenue slipped to $3.69 billion from $3.88 billion, just shy of the FactSet consensus of $3.73 billion. The company cut its 2017 guidance for segment operating income to a range of $1.60 billion to $1.65 billion from "approximately" $2.0 billion. "In addition to higher raw material costs, we have seen a weakening in OE and consumer replacement demand across many of our key markets during the first half, despite strong underlying industry fundamentals," said Chief Executive Richard Kramer. "The combination of these factors has led to a highly unusual first half environment, particularly given the favorable trends in miles driven, gasoline prices and unemployment that are generally supportive of our industry." The stock has rallied 14.9% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.6%.

Ford reports Q2 earnings above Wall Street expectations, gives positive 2017 guidance
              
              Shares of Ford Motor Co.  rose 1.6% before heading down in premarket trade on Wednesday after the company reported second-quarter profit and revenue that was above Wall Street expectations. Net income for the quarter came in at $2.04 billion, or 51 cents per share, compared with $1.97 billion, or 49 cents per share during the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share were 56 cents, above FactSet's earnings consensus for 43 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter hit $39.85 billion, compared with $39.49 billion during the same period a year ago. Revenue was above FactSet's expected $37.28 billion consensus. Revenue from automotive sales were up to $37.11 billion in the quarter, compared with $36.93 billion a year ago, and the company said that automotive profits were driven by North America. Europe and Asia Pacific were also profitable. The car manufacturer said it expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.85. The FactSet consensus is for full-year earnings of $1.51 per share. Ford shares are down 7% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 11% in the year.

Wells Fargo: FDA plan to lower nicotine could be opportunity for Altria, Philip Morris
              
              Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said Friday that a new Food and Drug Administration plan to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes could be a long-term opportunity for makers of reduced-risk products like Altria Group Inc.  and Philip Morris International Inc. . Shares of cigarette producers plunged after the FDA announcement, with Altria plummeting 9.6%, Philip Morris declining 0.4% and British American Tobacco  plunging 7.2% in extremely heavy midday trade. Altria and Philip Morris, however, have a "unique competitive advantage" with smokeless iQOS devices. Philip Morris said "iQOS heats the tobacco just enough to release the flavorful nicotine-containing vapor but without burning the tobacco." Even so, one medical journal study found that smoke from heat-not-burn cigarettes have 85% of the nicotine in conventional cigarettes. "We see this as an opportune entry point for long-term investors and would recommend building positions on today's broad weakness," Herzog said. "We also note that PM/MO's premarket tobacco product application with the FDA to commercialize iQOS in the U.S. remains under review." Altria shares have dropped 6.9% over the last three months and Philip Morris shares have risen 5.8%, compared with a 3.6% rise in the S&P 500 .

                                         said it ceased all operations and will redeem all publicly held shares following its failed acquisition of the coated-paper maker Appleton Papers Inc. Hicks Acquisition, founded by Thomas O. Hicks, had a $150 million initial public offering in October 2010. Such so-called blank-check companies are formed as empty shells to finance a business purchase with money raised through an IPO. On Friday, the company terminated its $675 million merger with Appleton Papers, citing volatile market conditions. Hicks on Monday said its certificate of incorporation gave it until July 14, to either consummate a business combination or start proceedings to dissolve. The company intends to redeem all shares of record on July 14, therefore, anyone who purchases its stock after this date won't be entitled to any redemption payments. As promptly as possible following the redemption, Hicks will dissolve. The per-share price will be equal to the total deposits in the company's trust account, after the payment of franchise, income taxes and dissolution expenses. The company's warrants have expired without any value and the holders won't be entitled to any redemption payments. Shares closed Friday at $9.93 and were halted in premarket trading. The stock rose 2.9% in the past 12 months.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

            Hicks Acquisition Company I, Inc. and Blackstone-Led Group Sign Definitive Agreement For Graham Packaging
        

 DALLAS, July 2, 2008 — Hicks Acquisition Company I, Inc. (AMEX: TOH) (“Hicks Acquisition”), a Dallas-based special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) founded and headed by Thomas O. Hicks, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which Graham Packaging Holdings Company (“Graham Packaging” or the “Company”) will go public through a transaction with Hicks Acquisition. Graham is controlled by The Blackstone Group and the Graham Group (together, the “Current Graham Equity Holders”).

Hicks Acquisition announced earlier this week that it had reached an agreement in principle for the contemplated transaction, subject to the execution of such definitive agreement. As previously indicated, the transaction, valued at approximately $3.2 billion, is believed to be the largest ever between a SPAC and an industrial company. 
Following completion of the transaction, the combined enterprise will be renamed Graham Packaging Company and will apply for listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Blackstone has agreed, to the extent necessary to avoid a change of control under the credit agreement, that it will maintain the largest ownership stake for at least two years as it continues to play an important role in guiding the Company strategically and operationally. 
Details of the Transaction 
In connection with the transaction, the Current Graham Equity Holders will receive $350 million of cash held in trust, 35.0 million common shares, and 2.8 million warrants upon completion of the transaction. The purchase consideration includes a transfer of value to the Current Graham Equity Holders of approximately 2.8 million Founder’s shares and warrants. In exchange, the Hicks-led sponsor will retain, through a series of transactions, Earnout Units, the shares of which have a trigger price of $13.75 and the warrants of which will become exercisable at a strike price of $10.00 and a trigger price of $15.00. Shares of Hicks Acquisition will become shares of the newly public Graham Packaging. 
Graham Packaging Holdings Company has received a legal opinion from its outside counsel, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, that the proposed transaction will not result in a change of control, or otherwise constitute a breach of its obligations, under its credit agreement or its bond indentures. 
The transaction is structured as an “IPO Reorganization” which is specifically contemplated by, and permitted under, the credit agreement, which provides that a change in control is not triggered so long as the Blackstone funds retain a voting stake larger than that held by any other holder. Upon completion of this initial public offering, the Company’s equity interests not retained by the Current Graham Equity Holders will be widely held by the public shareholders of Hicks Acquisition Co. and, thus, no person or group will have the 50%-or-greater voting power that would trigger a change of control under the Indentures. 
Hicks Acquisition was advised with regard to the transaction by Citi and the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. Houlihan Lokey served as a financial advisor to the independent directors of Hicks Acquisition. Graham Packaging was advised with regard to the transaction by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Blackstone Advisory Partners, and the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.

PRESS RELEASE
Hicks Acquisition Company I, Inc. (AMEX: TOH) (“Hicks Acquisition”), a Dallas-based special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) founded and headed by Thomas O. Hicks, announced today that it has reached an agreement in principle?subject to execution of a definitive agreement, which is expected to be finalized in the next few days?pursuant to which Graham Packaging Holdings Co. (“Graham Packaging” or the “Company”) will go public through a transaction with Hicks Acquisition in partnership with The Blackstone Group and the Graham Group (together, the “Current Graham Equity Holders”). The transaction, valued at approximately $3.2 billion, is believed to be the largest ever between a SPAC and an industrial company. 
 
Following completion of the transaction, the combined enterprise will be renamed Graham Packaging Company and will apply for listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Blackstone has agreed it will maintain the largest ownership stake for at least two years as it continues to play an important role in guiding the Company strategically and operationally.  





 
Founded in 1972 and based in York, Pennsylvania, Graham Packaging, with 2007 net sales of approximately $2.5 billion, is a global technology and innovation leader in value-added blow-molded rigid plastic containers for the branded food and beverage, household, personal care/specialty and automotive lubricant industries. Approximately 90 percent of the Company’s sales are in product categories in which it holds the number-one market position. Reflecting the importance to its customers of high levels of manufacturing expertise and technological innovation, the Company estimates that 80 percent of its products make use of proprietary Graham Packaging technology. 
 
Mr. Hicks, founder and Chairman of Hicks Acquisition, said: “After considering more than a hundred possible transactions, we’re tremendously pleased to have identified Graham Packaging as the right transaction for Hicks Acquisition, and to be partnering with Blackstone, whose senior partners I have had close business relationships with for many years, and the other Current Graham Equity Holders. Under the leadership since December 2006 of a new management team headed by Chairman and CEO Warren Knowlton and COO/CFO Mark Burgess, Graham Packaging has burnished its already-outstanding reputation as the technology and innovation leader in its industry’s high-value-added segment and has significantly improved its operational and financial performance. We look forward to completing the transaction and supporting the management team as they continue to create value for Graham Packaging’s customers, continue to build a solid platform for profitable growth, and work to realize Graham Packaging’s full operational, financial and investment potential.”  





 
Chinh Chu, a Graham Packaging board member and a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, said: “Blackstone is pleased to partner with Tom Hicks and management for this next chapter of Graham Packaging as a public company.” 
 
Warren Knowlton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Graham Packaging, said: “We look forward to partnering with Tom Hicks and Blackstone, both of whom have long track records of value creation. Graham Packaging has made significant progress since December 2006. With the support of our new ownership group and our strong free cash flow from operations, we will continue to invest in and grow our business, pay down debt, accelerate our earnings growth, and meet the needs and expectations of our employees, customers, suppliers and stockholders.”  





 
Graham Packaging is a market leader in value-added custom plastic containers, producing more than 20 billion container units annually at 83 manufacturing plants in North America, Europe and South America. It is the leading supplier of plastic containers for hot-fill juice and juice drinks, sports drinks, drinkable yogurt and smoothies, nutritional supplements, wide-mouth food, condiments, beer, liquid laundry detergent and motor oil. 
 
The Company provides custom valued-added products to many of the world’s leading consumer product companies, including, among others, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Danone/Dannon, Ocean Spray, Heinz, Abbott, Arizona Beverages, Nestl鯇erber, Anheuser-Busch, SAB Miller, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Church & Dwight, Dial/Henkel, Clorox and Colgate.  





 
The Company has an extensive global footprint and has led the industry in situating its manufacturing operations on or near the customer’s premises. A third of the Company’s plants employ an on-site manufacturing strategy. “We believe our collocation strategy enhances coordination with our customer base and is the cornerstone of improved sustainability for our customers and for us,” said Mr. Knowlton. 
 
Details of the Transaction 
Graham Packaging will go public through the transaction with Hicks Acquisition. In connection with the transaction, the current stockholders of Graham Packaging will receive $350 million of cash held in trust, 35.0 million common shares, and 2.8 million warrants upon completion of the transaction. The purchase consideration includes a transfer of value to the Current Graham Equity Holders of approximately 2.8 million Founder’s shares and warrants. In exchange, the Hicks-led sponsor will retain, through a series of transactions, Earnout Units, the shares of which have a trigger price of $13.75 and the warrants of which will become exercisable at a strike price of $10.00 and a trigger price of $15.00.  





 
The transaction has been structured to preserve Graham Packaging’s existing capital structure and does not breach, or result in a default under, the Company’s existing credit facilities or constitute a “change of control” under the indentures of the Company’s existing senior and senior subordinated notes issues. 3 
Hicks Acquisition’s existing public stockholders along with Mr. Hicks will own approximately 66 percent of Graham’s common shares outstanding after the completion of the transaction. The Current Graham Equity Holders, led by Blackstone, will remain in the aggregate the Company’s largest shareholder, with approximately 34 percent of the common shares outstanding, and will continue to play an important role in guiding the Company. The aforementioned common stock ownership percentages are calculated as basic ownership and exclude warrants and options from the ownership calculation. The existing management team, including Chairman and CEO Warren Knowlton and COO/CFO Mark Burgess, will continue to lead the Company. Completion of the transaction is subject to expiration or early termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, Hicks Acquisition stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to occur later this year.  





 
Hicks Acquisition was advised with regard to the transaction by Citi and the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. Houlihan Lokey served as a financial advisor to the independent directors of Hicks Acquisition. Graham Packaging was advised with regard to the transaction by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Blackstone Advisory Partners, and the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLC. 
 
Necessary Steps for Consummation of the Transaction 
As provided in Hicks Acquisition’s certificate of incorporation, each holder of Hicks Acquisition’s common stock has the right to convert such holder’s shares into cash if such holder votes against the transaction, elects to exercise such holder’s conversion rights and the transaction is approved and completed.  





 
Hicks Acquisition cannot complete the transaction unless (1) a majority of the shares issued in the initial public offering cast at the stockholders’ meeting are voted in favor of the transaction; (2) holders of no more than 16,559,999 shares of common stock (such number representing 30 percent minus one share of the 55,200,000 shares of Hicks Acquisition issued in the initial public offering) vote against the transaction and exercise their conversion rights to have their shares converted into cash; and (3) certain other customary conditions are satisfied. 
 
All of Hicks Acquisition’s initial stockholders have agreed to vote an aggregate of 13,800,000 shares, or 20.0% of Hicks Acquisition’s outstanding common stock, issued to them prior to the initial public offering in accordance with the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares issued in the initial public offering and have agreed to vote any of shares acquired in or following the initial public offering in favor of the transaction.

We are offering 48,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. We
estimate that the net proceeds of this offering, in addition to the funds we
will receive from the sale of the sponsor warrants (all of which will be
deposited into the trust account), will be as set forth in the following table.

 (1) º In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
     proceeds of a $225,000 loan from Mr. Hicks, as described in this
     prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon consummation of this offering out
     of the proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account.

 (2)º The underwriters have agreed to defer approximately $15.1 million of their
     underwriting commissions (or approximately $17.4 million if the
     over-allotment option is exercised in full), which equals 3.15% of the
     gross proceeds of this offering, until consummation of initial business
     combination. Upon consummation of our initial business combination,
     approximately $15.1 million, which constitutes the underwriters' deferred
     commissions (or approximately $17.4 million if the underwriters' over
     allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
     from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be
     released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase
     price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
     combination occurs, general corporate purposes, payment of principal or
     interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
     combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
     capital.

    A total of approximately $466.9 million (or approximately $536.1 million if
the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), of the net
proceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsor warrants described in
this prospectus, including approximately $15.1 million (or approximately
$17.4 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Except for a portion of the interest
income that may be released to us, the proceeds held in trust will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our
initial business combination or our liquidation.

    Commencing on the closing of this offering, we have agreed to pay Hicks
Holdings Operating, an entity owned and controlled by Thomas O. Hicks, our
founder and chairman of the board, a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, administrative services and secretarial support. This arrangement is
being agreed to by Mr. Hicks for our benefit and is not intended to provide
Mr. Hicks compensation in lieu of salary or other remuneration because it is
anticipated that the expenses to be paid by Mr. Hicks will approximate the
monthly reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

    We believe that amounts not held in trust as well as the interest income of
up to $5.7 million, subject to adjustment, earned on the trust account balance
(net of taxes payable) that may be released to us will be sufficient to pay the
costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on
the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business
in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth
due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of
our management team, but such members of our management team are not under any
obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. To the extent that the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, the maximum amount of
interest income we may withdraw from the trust account will proportionately
increase up to approximately $6.6 million. We will use such proportionate
increase in interest income to cover our working capital expenses. While we
currently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and while
they will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering, we
believe that any additional interest income released to us would facilitate our
ability to finance the exploration and consideration of a greater number of
potential acquisition targets.

    As of the date of this prospectus, Mr. Hicks, our founder and chairman of
the board, has advanced to us a total of $225,000 to be used for a portion of
the expenses of this offering. These advances are non-interest bearing,
unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2007 or the closing of this
offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being
placed in the trust account.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested by the
trustee only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act. Because the investment of the proceeds will be
restricted to these instruments, we believe we will meet the requirements for
the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the U.S. Investment
Company Act of 1940. Interest income of up to $5.7 million, subject to
adjustment, on the trust account balance (net of taxes payable) may be released
to us from the trust account to fund a portion of our working capital
requirements.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for a business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore:

º our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination  or 
  obtain necessary financial information may delay the completion of a 
  transaction;

º our obligation to repurchase for cash shares of common stock held by our 
  public stockholders who vote against the business combination and exercise 
  their conversion rights may reduce the resources available to us for a 
  business combination;

º we will not consummate a business combination if holders of more than 30% 
 (minus one share) of our outstanding shares of common stock sold in this 
  offering exercise their conversion rights;

º our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, 
  may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses; and

º the requirement to acquire one or more businesses or assets that have a fair 
  market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the trust account at the 
  time of the acquisition (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and 
  commissions of $12.6 million, or approximately $14.5 million if the 
  underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) could require us to 
  acquire the assets of several businesses at the same time, all of which sales 
  would be contingent on the closings of the other sales, which could make it 
  more difficult to consummate the initial business combination.

    Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in
successfully negotiating a business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company formed under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, for the purpose of acquiring, or
acquiring control of, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset
acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination one
or


 more businesses or assets. We have not identified any acquisition target and
we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions
with an entity that we will acquire in our initial business combination. Our
efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to a
particular industry, but we will not enter into a business combination with any
entity engaged in the energy industry as its principal business or whose
principal business operations are conducted outside of the United States or
Canada.

    We will seek to capitalize on the significant investing experience of our
management team, including the 35 years of private equity expertise of Thomas O.
Hicks, our founder and chairman of the board. Since 2005, Mr. Hicks has served
as the chairman of Hicks Holdings, LLC, a holding company for sports, real
estate and private equity investments of Mr. Hicks and his family, including the
National Hockey League's Dallas Stars, purchased in December 1995, Major League
Baseball's Texas Rangers, acquired in June 1998, and a 50% interest in the
English Premier League's Liverpool Football Club, acquired in March 2007. Hicks
Holdings is also the controlling shareholder of Latrobe Specialty Steel Company,
a specialty steel manufacturer. Its other corporate holdings include DirecPath,
a company that provides bundled DIRECTV programming, broadband voice and data
services, security and other locally based services to multiple dwelling units
across the United States, Ocular LCD, a designer, manufacturer and marketer of
high-performance liquid crystal displays, modules and systems, Berkshire
Resources, a gas and oil exploration company, Grupo Pilar, an animal and pet
food company in Argentina, SafeMed, a provider of decision support systems for
healthcare professionals and River City Landscape Supply, a provider of bulk and
bagged mulches, soils and decorative rocks. Hicks Holdings also holds
approximately 20% of the equity of Greatwide Logistics Services, a U.S.
non-asset based provider of dedicated transportation, third-party logistics,
warehouse/distribution and truckload brokerage solutions. Mr. Hicks co-founded
Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, a nationally prominent private equity firm in the
United States that specialized in leveraged acquisitions, and served as chairman
from 1989 through 2004. During Mr. Hicks' tenure as Chairman, Hicks Muse raised
over $12 billion of private equity funds, consummated over $50 billion of
leveraged acquisitions, and was one of the most active private investment firms
in the country. Mr. Hicks also co-founded and served as co-chief executive
officer of the leveraged buyout firm, Hicks & Haas, from 1984 to 1989.

    Subject to the requirements that our initial business combination have a
fair market value of at least 80% of the initial amount held in a trust account
at JP Morgan Chase, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as 
trustee (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of $12.6 million or 
approximately $14.5 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full), our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility 
in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. We will 
only consummate our initial business combination if we will become the 
controlling stockholder of the target. The key factor we will rely on in 
determining controlling stockholder status would be our acquisition of more than 
half of the voting equity interests of the target company. We will not consider 
any transaction that does not meet such criteria.

    We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we
believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use
these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities. However,
we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that
does not meet these criteria and guidelines.

º Established Companies with Proven Track Records. We will seek to acquire 
  established companies with sound historical financial performance. We will 
  typically focus on companies with a history of strong operating and financial 
  results. We do not intend to acquire start-up companies.

º Companies with Strong Free Cash Flow Characteristics. We will seek to acquire
  companies that have a history of strong, stable free cash flow generation. We 
  will focus on companies that have predictable, recurring revenue streams and 
  an emphasis on low working capital and  capital expenditure requirements.

º Strong Competitive Industry Position. We will seek to acquire businesses that 
  operate within industries that have strong fundamentals. The factors we will 
  consider include growth prospects, competitive dynamics, level of 
  consolidation, need for capital investment and barriers to entry. Within these 
  industries, we will focus on companies that have a leading or niche market 
  position. We will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses
  relative to their competitors, focusing on product quality, customer loyalty, 
  cost impediments associated with customers switching to competitors, patent 
  protection and brand positioning. We will seek to acquire businesses that 
  demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to 
  protect their market position and profitability and deliver strong free cash 
  flow.

º Experienced Management Team. We will seek to acquire businesses that have 
  strong, experienced management teams. We will focus on management teams with 
  a proven track record of driving revenue growth, enhancing profitability and 
  generating strong free cash flow. We believe that the operating expertise of 
  our officers and directors will complement, not replace, the target's 
  management team.

º Diversified Customer and Supplier Base. We will seek to acquire businesses 
  that have a diversified customer and supplier base. Companies with a 
  diversified customer and supplier base are generally better able to endure 
  economic downturns, industry consolidation, changing business preferences and 
  other factors that may negatively impact their customers, suppliers and 
  competitors.

    We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our
attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers,
venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management
buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may
be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being
solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us
to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis,
since many of these sources will have read this prospectus and know what types
of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their
affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they
become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or
informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as by attending trade
shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary
deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us
as a result of the track record and business relationships of Mr. Hicks, our
founder and chairman of the board.

    We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial
or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective
target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one
or more of the following:

º financial condition and results of operations;

. growth potential;

º brand recognition and potential;

º experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;

º capital requirements;

º stage of development of the business and its products or services;

º existing distribution arrangements and the potential for expansion;

º degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products or services;

º proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or 
  other protection for products or formulas;

º impact of regulation on the business;

º regulatory environment of the industry;

º seasonal sales fluctuations and the ability to offset these fluctuations 
  through other business combinations, introduction of new products, or product 
  line extensions;

º costs associated with effecting the business combination;

º industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of 
  market sectors in which a target business participates; and

º macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.

    These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to
the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the
extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations, factors
and criteria our management deems relevant to our business objective. In
evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due
diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with
incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers
and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and
other information which will be made available to us.

    In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from
multiple corporate affiliations, each of our officers has agreed, pursuant to a
written agreement with us, that until the earliest of our initial business
combination, our liquidation or such time as he or she ceases to be an officer,
to present to our company for our consideration, prior to presentation to any
other entity, any business opportunity with a fair market value of $200 million
or more, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations he or
she might have. As more fully discussed in "Management-Conflicts of Interest" on
page 85, in the event that any of our officers becomes aware of a business
combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to
which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she
may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity
prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Each of our
officers, other than Thomas O. Hicks, Jr. and Mack Hicks, currently have certain
relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations which may take priority
over their duties to us.

    If we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
after the date of this prospectus and expend all of the net proceeds of this
offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without
taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial
per-share liquidation price would be $9.75, or $0.25 less than the per-unit
offering price of $10.00. The per share liquidation price includes approximately
$12.6 million in deferred underwriting commissions (or approximately
$14.5 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full)
that would also be distributable to our public stockholders.

    Our executive offices are located at 100 Crescent Court, Suite 1200, Dallas,
Texas, 75201, and our telephone number is (214) 615-2300.
