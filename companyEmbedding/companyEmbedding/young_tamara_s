  Two Thumbs Up!By Janea, Submitted on 2015-02-25The best part about this book is that it is full of creative activities and short lessons that will strengthen your family and inspire your children to be more cooperative, gracious, build self-esteem and a host of other desirable traits. We have tried several of the activities listed in this book and they have not only been very successful with our young children (ages five, three and baby), but they were extremely fun and we will definitely repeat the activities. One of my favorite concepts in this book is the 'family team' which my children seem to have grasped as demonstrated by my five year old who willingly carried a ten pound bag of potatoes from the car, up the stairs and into the kitchen (a real accomplishment considering the normal drama I get when I ask her to carry in an orange). The chapters on how to get your young children to do chores is also very helpful. The author has some great ideas on teaching your children manners (see the thankyou-please rule). There are many great tips on how to make the day-to-day routine of mothering easier and what to do if you feel exasperated with your children (not that this ever happens to me¡Kmy children are perfect angels fº) This book is a breath of fresh air and has rejuvenated my desire to recognize the good things my children do each day and to be a better Mom. I would definitely recommend this book to parents of young children. It is so hard to find a book that targets this population. I found myself looking forward each night to reading a chapter or two in this book because the author is funny, and has lots of insightful bits of wisdom. Two thumbs up!
 




  A book to read over and overBy Lauren, Submitted on 2015-02-25This book provides many wonderful ideas on raising children and making it fun. I refer to it frequently. There's even recipes in the back I have used.
 




  Full of practical ideas that workBy Jennifer, Submitted on 2015-02-25As a mother of twin toddlers, I find myself running out of patience and ideas quite frequently. Not only did this book have funny stories that made me feel like I'm not alone, it also gave me practical ideas that I could try immediately. Love it!
 




  Fantastic BookBy Jennifer, Submitted on 2015-02-25I loved the short format of the book that actually allowed me to read it a piece at a time while watching my kids.  The ideas were great and I'm already trying to incorporate some of the thoughts.  I would recommend this to anyone!
 




  Super book!  funny stories, super projectsBy HEIDI, Submitted on 2015-02-25Super book!  Down-to-earth and full of great ideas and stories.  Does not gloss over the tough times of motherhood and makes me feel like my 'hectic' family days are more normal than I thought.  Thanks for a great handbook that I will reference often!
 




  MUST-HAVE for MothersBy daniel, Submitted on 2015-02-25This is the BEST book about mothering that I have ever read.  It has EVERYTHING!  Practical advice, great quotes, fun stories that let you know you are not alone, and then super family activities that teach those principles and actually lets you apply what you are learning.  I have implemented many of her ideas and it has made me a better mom and has made my kids much happier.  She is so down to earth and honest which is very refreshing.  I also find it very motivational without making me feel like a failure.  I look at my kids and my life differently after reading this book.  I am a better wife and mother as I apply what I have learned.  It is a must-have for every mom out there who wants to improve herself and her life.
