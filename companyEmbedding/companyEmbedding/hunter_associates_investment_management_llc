Anti-Money Laundering


As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, all financial institutions, including Hunter Associates are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act (the “Act”). These institutions now, among other things, must verify the identity of all new investors, with certain limited exceptions, as defined in the Act. Verifying identity requires more than simply asking for information from a prospective investor. Institutions must ask for certain information, and must also verify the information provided through the use of available data and/or documents. The law also requires firms to monitor and report to the government suspicious activity in investors’ accounts. All investor information remains secure and subject to our Privacy Policy.
While we take great care in attempting to know our investors’ individual investment goals and objectives today, this law requires us to take additional steps to verify the identity of persons opening new accounts, including verifying the identity of prospective investors, consulting applicable government agency lists of known or suspected criminals, terrorists and terrorist organizations to determine if any of our prospective or current investors are on such list, and conducting, in certain circumstances, additional due diligence when accounts are opened, including requesting information about the source of funds deposited into such accounts.
Hunter Associates intends to comply with this and all other requirements of law, and we thank you for your assistance in meeting our obligations.

Money Market Cash Sweep Program

Hunter Associates offers a money market cash sweep program “cash sweep program” through the introducing broker dealer custodian. The cash sweep program invests any uninvested cash balances for which no interest is otherwise earned or paid in your account. The cash sweep program automatically sweeps (deposits) any available cash in the account into interest-bearing money market funds. The invested fund balances remain until these balances are invested by you, otherwise needed to satisfy obligations arising in connection with your account, or requested by you for payment. 
You must monitor and determine the best cash sweep option for you under this program. You may also elect not to participate in the cash sweep program and instead periodically invest cash balances directly. 
You will be notified if we modify the cash sweep program in a way that results in changing the sweep vehicle for your account. Unless you tell us otherwise within the time period specified in the notice, your cash balances will be moved to the new sweep vehicle that we designate under the program.

Our Heritage
On July 2, 1992, David Hunter founded Hunter Associates with a strong emphasis on identifying and achieving our clients’ financial goals through a combination of brokerage and investment advisory services. A step-by-step process was developed to tailor a specific, custom investment strategy for each client and to ensure that risk versus reward remains aligned with the clients’ financial goals. He believed then, and we still believe, that this model is the best way for us to offer superior service to clients of all financial sizes. 
Our commitment to provide true value to our clients, friends and associates remains the foundation of our mission. We move forward with continuing dedication to help our clients define and achieve their financial objectives.
At Hunter Associates, our goal has always been to care for our clients and all aspects of their financial lives, helping them define and achieve their financial objectives. We continue to aspire to be the best investment management company we can possibly be, by every measure. We expect to be a company that creates real value for its clients and employees by delivering high quality financial services and solutions; employing the best people, nurturing them, and enabling them to succeed—all while remaining steadfastly committed to an ethic of honesty and service. Our success, both financial and otherwise, will be a by-product of achieving these goals. While so much has changed over the years, our enduring commitment to be a true partner and friend, providing genuine value, remains the same.

Our Commitment to Clients
Clients who are new to Hunter Associates are often surprised by the level of detail in our introductory and discovery process. Our commitment to each client begins at the first meeting, in which our advisors ask questions, listen, learn and gain an understanding of the client’s needs and goals. As we learn, we design and recommend individualized solutions to help our clients grow, preserve and distribute wealth over a lifetime – and in many cases beyond.
Clients have the freedom to determine how they wish to affiliate with us. We offer both brokerage and investment advisory services. 
We understand that choosing a financial advisor is a complex decision; we encourage clients to explore which partnership best fits their financial strategy. 
Our Philosophy
Our philosophy demands that we know our clients well in order to contribute to their financial well-being. We recognize that each client is unique; therefore, each financial strategy is individually designed.
Working closely with our clients, we agree on a division of assets into four risk-based categories of investments. We integrate our thorough understanding of each client’s needs with our process-driven portfolio management. 
Hunter Associates was built on a collaborative approach to individual account management. We continue to believe this unique approach combines the best elements of both brokerage and advisory firms, allowing us to define, implement and achieve the ultimate investment objectives for each of our clients.
Our Communities
Hunter Associates is dedicated to being an active member our local communities.
Our headquarters, in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh, has been located in the historic Koppers Building since 1992. We have seen the city change, grow and advance over time; we celebrate the history and hard work of those who have come before us. We are proud of our longevity in the downtown area and actively look for opportunities to support our city. 
Our Salem branch office is nestled in the small town of Salem, Ohio. In 2013, Hunter Associates completed renovations of an old, empty convenience store into our Salem branch’s new permanent location. We are honored to breathe new life into the unused building and contribute to the community an attractive office space complete with state-of-the art technology. 
Our Mission Statement
Our primary goal is to help our clients define and achieve their financial objectives. To do this, we establish an investment plan, adopt an investment policy, including an appropriate asset allocation and select suitable securities to reach these goals. Our further goal is to provide our associates with growth opportunities, a rewarding experience and a pleasant environment. Our success, both financial and otherwise, will be a by-product of achieving these goals.
