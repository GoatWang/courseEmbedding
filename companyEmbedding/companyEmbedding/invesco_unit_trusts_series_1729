Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio (GLDV0173)
	
	




Strategy
		  	
		  	
		
		The Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio is an enhanced index* unit investment trust that invests in stocks of foreign and domestic companies. The strategy contains three approximately equally weighted dividend oriented strategies: the Select 10 Industrial Strategy, the Select S&P Industrial Strategy, and the EAFESM Select 20 Strategy. 

Why consider investing in the Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio?
The Portfolio invests in stocks of foreign and domestic companies selected by applying separate uniquely specialized strategies. The Portfolio combines three investment strategies: the Select 10 Industrial Strategy, the Select S&P Industrial Strategy, and the EAFESM Select 20 Strategy.




Here are some reasons why the Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio may be a viable addition to your portfolio: 

Foreign Exposure 
Multi-Index Exposure 
Potential Decreased Volatility
Potential Dividends 

Stock Selection Process
The Global 45 Dividend Strategy Portfolio invests in stocks of foreign and domestic companies. The strategy contains three approximately equally weighted dividend oriented strategies:

The Select 10 Industrial Strategy selects the ten highest dividend-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM (DJIASM) for the portfolio.
The Select S&P Industrial Strategy

Beginning with the Standard & Poor's Industrials Index, select only those stocks ranked either A or A+ by S&P Capital IQ's Earnings and Dividend Rankings.
Eliminate stocks that are in both the S&P Industrial Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Select stocks with the highest market capitalization (the top 75 percent).
Select the 15 highest dividend-yielding stocks.


In addition, a stock will be excluded if, based on publicly available information as of the selection date, the company is the target of an announced business acquisition which Invesco expects will close within six months of the date of deposit.
The EAFESM Select 20 Strategy



Start with the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East) Index. 
Assess company quality. This consists of applying sales growth, earnings growth and dividend performance screens. 
Stocks with the highest market capitalizationthe top 75 percentare chosen.
Select a portfolio of the twenty highest dividend-yielding stocks.Please note that stocks traded in Singapore are eliminated from the portfolio strategy to help limit exposure to uncertain political and economic conditions. Stocks which are passive foreign investment companies are also eliminated because of the negative tax treatment which could result from such ownership.



* An enhanced sector (or “index”) strategy refers to a unit
investment trust strategy, sponsored by Invesco Capital
Markets, Inc., that seeks to outperform an index by
investing in an objectively selected subset of stocks from
the same index.

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk




There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment
in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of
securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what
you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life
except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be
considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by
investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from
one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s
board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or
assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current
levels or increase over time.

assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current
levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in
the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold.
There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits
and losses.
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the
United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic
uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
The Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM (DJIASM) is an unmanaged index generally representative of the U.S.
stock market. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is an unmanaged index generally representative of the U.S.
stock market. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, and Far East Index ("MSCI EAFESM")
is an unmanaged index generally representative of major overseas stock markets. MSCI EAFESM data is U.S.
dollar adjusted. The S&P Industrials Index is a capitalization — weighted index of all stocks in the S&P 500 Index
that are involved in the industrials industry.
Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an
investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not
possible to invest directly in an index. The historical performance of the index is shown for illustrative purposes
only; it is not meant to forecast, imply or guarantee the future performance of any particular investment or
the trust, which will vary. Securities in which the trust invests may differ from those in the index.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer
the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend
investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily
out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment
combines the two styles.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk




There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment
in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of
securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what
you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life
except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be
considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by
investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from
one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s
board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or
assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current
levels or increase over time.

The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in
the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold.
There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits
and losses.
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the
United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic
uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
The Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM (DJIASM) is an unmanaged index generally representative of the U.S.
stock market. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is an unmanaged index generally representative of the U.S.
stock market. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, and Far East Index ("MSCI EAFESM")

dollar adjusted. The S&P Industrials Index is a capitalization — weighted index of all stocks in the S&P 500 Index
that are involved in the industrials industry.
Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an
investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not
possible to invest directly in an index. The historical performance of the index is shown for illustrative purposes
only; it is not meant to forecast, imply or guarantee the future performance of any particular investment or
the trust, which will vary. Securities in which the trust invests may differ from those in the index.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer
the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend
investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily
out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment
combines the two styles.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.

 The above graph represents a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the trust strategy (not any actual trust) and the associated benchmark over the period indicated in the graph. The graph assumes the sum of the initial investment ($10,000) and all dividends (including those on stocks trading ex-dividend as of the last day of the year) and appreciation during a year are reinvested at the end of that year. 
All strategy performance is hypothetical (not any actual trust) and reflects trust sales charges (full sales charge in first year of 2.95% and reduced rollover charge thereafter of 1.95%) and expenses but not brokerage commissions on stocks or taxes. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Actual returns will vary from hypothetical strategy returns due to timing differences and because the trust may not be invested equally in all stocks or be fully invested at all times. In any given year the strategy may lose money or underperform the index. Returns are calculated by taking year-end prices, subtracting them from the prices at the end of the following year (adjusting for any stock splits that might have occurred during the year) and adding dividends received for the period divided by starting price. Average annual total return and total return measure change in the value of an investment plus dividends, assuming quarterly reinvestment of dividends. Average annual total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects aggregate change and is not annualized. Standard deviation is a measure of volatility that represents the degree to which an investment's performance has varied from its average performance over a particular period. Standard deviation does not compare the volatility of an investment relative to other investments or the overall stock market. The more an investment's return varies from the investment's average return, the more volatile the investment. Standard deviation is based on past performance and is no guarantee of future results.
 Please keep in mind that high, double-digit and/or triple-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions. 
Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Dividend Sustainability Portfolio (DVST0173)
	
	




Objective
		  	
		
		The Portfolio seeks above average capital appreciation. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of stocks derived from the Standard & Poor's 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index consists of stocks of those companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that have increased their actual dividend payments in each of the last 25 years.



A dividend growers domestic option
What makes an aristocrat? A commitment to dividends. The strategy invests in companies that have shown their ability to provide consistent and competitive income potential. 



Totalreturn
 
Incomesustainability
 
Access to industry leaders 


Corporate managers use stable and increasing dividends as a sign of confidence in their firm's prospects, which we believe is important to sustainable income and capital appreciation. 
 
Companies with strong dividend coverage should be able to increase dividend payments.

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
 Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.  This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The Portfolio is concentrated in the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. Companies that manufacture, distribute and provide consumer products and services face risks such as intense competition, the lack of serious barriers to entry for online entrants, economic recession and a slowdown in consumer spending trends.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles.

This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
 Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.  This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The Portfolio is concentrated in the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. Companies that manufacture, distribute and provide consumer products and services face risks such as intense competition, the lack of serious barriers to entry for online entrants, economic recession and a slowdown in consumer spending trends.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles.
