Company Overview

Florida Pneumatic Manufacturing Corporation
www.florida-pneumatic.com
				Florida Pneumatic Manufacturing Corporation ("Florida Pneumatic") imports or manufactures approximately 50 types of pneumatic hand tools under the names "Florida Pneumatic", "Universal Tool" and "Fuji", as well as under the trade names or trademarks of other private label customers. Pneumatic tools are similar in appearance and function to electric hand tools, such as sanders, grinders, drills, saws and impact wrenches, but are powered by compressed air, rather than by electricity, and are generally less expensive to operate, lighter in weight and more powerful than their electric counterparts. Florida Pneumatic recently launched a new line of pneumatic drills and screwdrivers which has been well received in the marketplace. Products are sold to distributors, retailers, private label customers, industrial maintenance and production staffs, do-it-yourself mechanics, automobile mechanics and auto body repairmen. The Berkley division markets a line of pipe and bolt dies, pipe taps, pipe and tubing cutter wheels and replacement electrical components for a popular line of pipe-cutting and threading equipment. The Tradesman division manufactures heavy-duty  aluminum and iron pipe wrenches.


				

Hy-Tech Machine Incorporated
www.hy-techinc.com
				Hy-Tech manufactures and distributes pneumatic tools and parts for industrial applications. Hy-Tech manufactures approximately sixty types of industrial pneumatic tools, most of which are sold at prices ranging from $300 to $7,000, under the names "ATP", "Thaxton", "THOR" and "Eureka", as well as under the trade names or trademarks of other private label customers. This line of products includes grinders, drills, saws, impact wrenches and pavement breakers. These tools are similar in appearance and function to electric tools, but are powered by compressed air, rather than directly by electricity. Air tools, as they are also called, are generally less expensive to operate, offer better performance and weigh less than their electrical counterparts.
				
					Hy-Tech's products are sold to distributors and private label customers through in-house sales personnel and manufacturers' representatives. Users of Hy-Tech's tools include refineries, chemical plants, power generation facilities, the heavy construction industry, oil and mining companies and heavy industry.

MELVILLE, N.Y., Feb. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- P&F Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:   PFIN)  ("P&F") today announced the sale of  Nationwide Industries Inc., ("Nationwide") to a subsidiary of Argosy Private Equity, a division of Argosy Capital for approximately $22.2 million, subject to working capital adjustment.  
Richard Horowitz, P&F's Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President of P&F stated, "The sale of Nationwide is a significant component of our strategic objective of transforming P&F into a more focused organization.  Part of this business strategy is to center our position in the air tools and related accessories sector.  While Nationwide has delivered many years of earnings contributing to P&F's overall success, this transaction is another step toward enabling P&F to move forward on its strategy, as we have divested our other diversified business units over the last several years."  Mr. Horowitz added, "The net proceeds will be used to pay down our bank borrowings.  Lastly, I wish to point out that the staff at Nationwide is hardworking, loyal employees, who always put Nationwide, P&F as well as our shareholders first.  However, we believe this is the right decision at the right time to enable P&F to grow in a more focused and integrated manner."  
Mr. Horowitz concluded his remarks by noting, "Daroth Capital Advisors acted as financial advisor to P&F throughout this arduous process.  Many thanks go to Peter Rothschild, President of Daroth and to his team.  Their efforts contributed greatly to the success of this strategic transaction."
