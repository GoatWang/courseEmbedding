Johnson Controls defended CEO Alex Molinaroli following reports of his ties to a convicted swindler, saying the executive was a victim of the scam, not an accomplice.
In an Oct. 22 report, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel detailed the relationship between Molinaroli and Joseph Zada, who was convicted on Sept. 3 in a Florida federal court on 15 counts of mail fraud in connection with an alleged Ponzi scheme.
From 1998 to 2009, Zada allegedly took funds from at least 20 investors -- including former Detroit Red Wings hockey star Sergei Fedorov -- but never invested the money. He has been ordered to pay $122 million in restitution and civil penalties.
$20 million in aid
Citing a transcript of Zada’s bond hearing, the Journal Sentinel quoted federal prosecutors who said Molinaroli offered to help Zada pay $20 million in restitution to his victims.
Molinaroli also had purchased a mansion for Zada’s use in Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich., and paid his legal bills, according to the transcript.
In a written statement issued today, company spokesman Fraser Engerman said Molinaroli was “a victim of Zada’s scheme, not an accomplice. He has not benefited from it in any way.”
Molinaroli had hoped that his loans to Zada “would ultimately facilitate repayments to all victims -- including himself,” the statement noted, adding: “Alex Molinaroli is not an ally of Joseph Zada.”
Engerman declined to make Molinaroli available for comment.
According to a 2013 Securities and Exchange Commission statement, Zada lured investors by portraying himself as a successful businessman with ties to Saudi Arabian oil ventures.
Zada also “hosted extravagant parties, drove expensive luxury vehicles, and maintained expensive homes” in Florida and suburban Detroit, the statement said.
Instead of investing the funds in oil ventures, Zada “used the money to support his lavish lifestyle and to make purported returns on investments to prior investors,” the SEC said.
Johnson Controls has asserted that Molinaroli was one of Zada’s victims.
Major reorganization
Molinaroli has launched a major corporate reorganization of JCI, and his entanglement with Zada could be a distraction for him and the company at a time when investors are assessing its strategy.
In July, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls announced that it would spin off its $22 billion seating and interiors unit, as it turns its focus to its other product lines: batteries and energy management for buildings.
Molinaroli, 56, became CEO in 2013, after a 30-year tenure at JCI. The board stood by him following revelations last year that he had an extramarital affair with a former consultant to the company, but JCI fired the woman’s consulting firm.

Plenty of Horne
 Molinaroli Sues Neighbors, Condo Group
Embattled Johnson Controls CEO hasn't yet moved in, but legal sparks fly,

Construction continues on the property. Photo by Michael Horne.
Alex Molinaroli, the ever-embattled Johnson Controls CEO, filed a lawsuit on August 5th against his future neighbors, Kostantinos P. Agoudemos and Stacy Miller, who own the Park Terrace Bluff Homes Condominium next to the one Molinaroli is extensively remodeling for his own use just north of Commerce St. and west of Humboldt Ave.
At the heart of the matter is a narrow strip of land that separates the two condos. Is it a common area, or one for the use of the abutting (Agoudemos and Miller) property? Does Molinaroli’s construction project encroach on the neighbors, for which they should be compensated? Or has it been approved by the condo association as part of his construction agreement?
These are not easy questions in the world of condominium law.


Molinaroli’s remodeling of the substantial end unit has been going on for months — too long, according to the association. His improvements include the installation of a swimming pool, which would require substantial upgrades in the HVAC system to mitigate the effects of the pool’s heater on the general atmosphere of the residence.
Molinaroli’s contractors installed some vent pipes on his building in what the respondents allege is an area under their domain, Molinaroli alleges otherwise, citing condominium documents, and concessions he made to the neighbors to compensate them for the construction by upgrading their ventilation systems at considerable expense. Three air conditioning units can be seen operating in the space, screened somewhat from the neighbors’ deck there.
But apparently something went wrong to sour relations after certain easements were granted to Molinaroli.
Agoudemos and Miller wrote to Molinaroli and Kristin Ihle, his companion, that “the new pipes whistle so loud it’s a nuisance.”
The condo association cited the “the exhaust pipe and not approved service and utility lines” that led to Molinaroli’s condo in a letter on July 22nd to Molinaroli. The association also complained that the “construction completion deadline had lapsed.” It “reserved the right to amend” the complaint to add to the list if necessary, wrote association president Mona Patel.
Things Get Personal

Agoudemos and Miller also raised a question about a security camera, which might seem an unusual feature, but perhaps not in the home of a CEO who makes over a million dollars a month. Most of the neighbors probably have to get by on under $3,000 per week.
“The camera that will overlook my yard is a violation of our privacy rights,” wrote Agoudemos.
Referring to the couple’s initial contacts with their new neighbor, Agoudemos wrote, “we wholeheartedly believed you were a generous person, we feel you guys have taken advantage of our kindness. …We would also like to know what your camera is pointing at. Yes, I am trying to be a dick about it.”
Molinaroli’s lawyer, Bruce McIlnay, responded that “Agoudemos was convicted of selling drugs in Ozaukee County.”
However, I have found no evidence of this in the Ozaukee County Circuit Court records, where one would expect a criminal drug sales charge to have been filed.
Fourth claim for relief.
Lawyer Claims Neighbors Attempting to “Extort” Molinaroli
Molinaroli’s request for relief concluded with these statements:
“Agoudemos and Miller, by their actions, have interfered with Molanaroli’s easement granted by the Association, and have, through their intimidation of the directors of the Association, via emails and verbal threats, caused Molinaroli monetary damages [including for this case] …in an amount to be proven at trial.
“Such interference was without justification or privilege but was intended to extort money or gifts from Molinaroli for exercising is [sic] rights under the Easement.
“Such wrongful intent is evidenced by Agoudemos’ and Miller’s statements ‘that Alex could offer them $10,000 …$20,000 on top of work to be done and they wouldn’t accept it …they even commented that Alex should have purchased their unit from then when they had made that suggestion.”
Not First Dispute for Neighbors or Molinaroli
Agoudemos and Miller have a history of suing in their neighborhood. They have an open lawsuit against Bryan Mardak, the previous owner of their property. It was filed in 2014.
As for Molinaroli, he has been immersed in controversy for years. As we reported, in May, 2014, his wife Patsy threw him out of the house after she discovered he was having an affair. For good measure, she shot the place up with a .38 caliber pistol and took an aluminum bat to an arcade game, windows and a china cabinet in their $1 million Brookfield home. Molinaroli moved to a one-bedroom penthouse unit in the Park Lafayette Tower.
As Bloomberg.com has reported, Molinaroli’s tenure as Johnson Controls CEO has been marked by “one lurid headline after another,” including his extra-marital affair and divorce, a finding by his board of directors that he violated company ethics, and the fact the he was among those questioned in a federal Department of Justice investigation of a ponzi scheme. Molinaroli “was both the victim of Ponzi scheme artist Joseph Zada and provided financial support after the fraudster was charged,” Bloomberg noted.


“After Zada’s conviction in September, the federal prosecutor disclosed that Molinaroli had purchased the swindler’s home in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and allowed him to continue to live there rent-free, covered Zada’s legal bills and offered to provide millions of dollars in restitution for victims.”
In the latest controversy, shareholders “voted overwhelmingly to oppose the $74 million in ‘golden parachute’ payments and a $20 million retention bonus being granted to Molinaroli as part of a merger agreement with Tyco International,” as the Journal Sentinel has reported. A class action suit has also been launched arguing that Molinaroli and other Johnson Control executives are being unfairly enriched.
So compared to all that, this dispute with the neighbors is small potatoes for Molinaroli, who has asked for a declaratory judgment allowing him to continue using the disputed space between the buildings.
No further court dates have been scheduled at this time before Judge David A. Hansher, and a response to the complaint has not been filed.

This is a photo of a computer monitor in the basement of the Courthouse, the only place where these documents are available. Printed copies are $1.50 per page. I took a picture instead. The “print screen” button would have done me no good.

I was wondering who was building the new unit in the neighborhood!
Sad to learn it’s that douchebag from Johnson Controls.

            Johnson Controls CEO: Hard to believe coal is the future   
			                        Friday,  2 Jun 2017 |  7:45  AM ET |  03:25 




President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement endangers the United States' leadership in clean energy technologies, Johnson Controls chief Alex Molinaroli told CNBC on Friday.
Molinaroli appeared on "Squawk Box" a day after Trump said the U.S. would withdrawal from the worldwide agreement to curb carbon emissions.  The president said he would seek to start new talks for a "fair" deal on controlling emissions.
"You know, it's not going to affect Johnson Controls," said Molinaroli. "I'm just more concerned about the United States. You know, the leadership position that it has around technologies, around these technologies. It is just seceding that leadership position," he said.

Molinaroli, who was one of several CEOs who urged Trump to stay in the Paris Agreement, said the world is investing in clean energy technologies. He said coal is not the future.
"We don't live in the world of 100 years ago where the United States was the only economy in a closed economy. Market forces include what other people are doing around the world. It doesn't just include what's happening in the United States," he said.
Also on "Squawk Box," the chairman and CEO of Ohio-based coal company Murray Energy praised Trump's decision, saying it will save jobs.
"President Trump was very courageous, he was very prudent in withdrawing entirely from the fraudulent global climate agreement in Paris," said Robert Murray, a routine supporter of Trump's energy deregulation efforts. "He already killed the Clean Power Plan of the most dangerous president we've ever had, Barack Obama."  
The Clean Power Plan was an Obama administration policy aimed at combating climate change, which Trump scrapped earlier this year.
Murray said it's hard to predict how Trump's decision will affect coal but said coal will participate in the United State's growth.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
