Publisher's Description▼▲
People in churches today are hungry for a word from God. Preachers need to prepare and deliver sound biblical sermons that connect with their audience in a meaningful way. Whether you are a student new to preaching or a veteran looking to brush up your preaching skills, here is a valuable resource. Good preaching begins with good exegesis. Preaching Gods Word walks you through the steps of the Interpretive Journey from the biblical text to contemporary application:  Grasp the text in Their Town (what it meant to the original audience).  Measure the width of the river that separates the biblical context from today.  Cross the Principalizing Bridge by identifying the timeless theological principles.  Grasp the text in Our Town. While the science of solid biblical interpretation is essential to effective preaching, it must be married to the art of contemporary communication in order to bring the message home. Preaching Gods Word also shows you how to understand your audience, develop powerful applications, use illustrations well, and deliver the sermon effectively. The concluding chapters discuss the unique preaching challenges presented by the various biblical genres, providing interpretive keys, things to avoid, and numerous examples. Carter, Duvall, and Hays have given us a basic and worthy manual of how-tos for preaching. Now since Haddon Robinsons classic text has a book taken such a practical and understandable, step-by-step approach to the sermon. -Calvin Miller, Professor of Divinity, Beeson Divinity School In a day when the church-world is lulled into complacency by sermons that are little more than entertaining homilies on good values and fix-it paradigms, here is a guide to proclamation the way it was meant to bebiblical, understandable, and transforming. -Joseph M. Stowell, Teaching Pastor, Harvest Bible Church; Former President, Moody Bible Institute.

Employees







Carter, J Scott
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Arizona:













Does Carter, J Scott carry a valid contracting license?



Although the State of Arizona allows its residents to hire unlicensed contractors, it strongly encourages them to hire licensed contractors for remodeling or construction work.
Carter, J Scott currently holds license 14000 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in Arizona?



The Arizona Registrar of Contractors maintains high standards for licensing. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience (this varies a bit based on specialty).











Your liability risk when hiring Carter, J Scott



Licensed contractors in Arizona with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring Carter, J Scott



Residential contractors are required to provide a consumer protection bond. This may be in the form of a Surety Bond; cash deposit in the amount of $200,000; or payment into the Residential Contractors' Recovery Fund. Under certain conditions, consumers may be eligible to apply to the residential contractors' recovery fund and receive up to thirty thousand dollars to have the work corrected or completed.











What else should I know before hiring Carter, J Scott



Starting in '02, the ROC began performing a criminal background check on license applicants by checking their fingerprints against the FBI criminal database. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Arizona Registrar of Contractors recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

PARTICIPATION MATTERS


                  MA320 is a proof heavy course designed to teach mathematical concepts. If you aren't a math major i would not take this course. I am a geology major and i understood some of the material but most went over my head. Dr. Carter is a brilliant teacher who probably passed me out of pity. This course is tough for non math majors so avoid if your a minor

                  Dr. Carter is an amazing professor and takes the time to get the material across in a way that resonates with each student.  However, be prepared to work.  If you do the homework and put in the effort, you will do very well and learn more than from other professors.  If you don't want to work or learn, DO NOT take Dr. Carter.  Also, office hours!

                  His lectures are a little scattered, but they do apply to what's being taught, you just don't realize it right away.   He posts pictures of the notes he makes during lectures, but won't make much sense unless you listened to them too.

RESPECTED


                  Dr. Carter is my favorite teacher of all time. He is a bit odd and has a strange sense of humor, but that is what makes him such a great teacher. He is always willing to help and doesn't want to see anyone fail.

HILARIOUS


                  I initially really disliked Dr Carter because he is on a different wavelength in terms of the jokes he makes.  As you familiarize yourself with his teaching style and jokes he becomes a wonderfully pleasant teacher.  There are quizzes every single class, but they really help to prepare for the exams.

                  Great math professor. Had for cal I and II. Very helpful and would sometimes break from his schedule just to answer questions or clarify difficult concepts.

                  Dr. Carter has probably been the best math teacher I have ever had. He is a super great teacher and even though I made a B in the class I feel like I still learned Calculus 2 pretty well. Attendance isn't necessarily mandatory but if you show up and bs a quiz you get 2 or 3 points instead of no points which plays a big role. SUPER GOOD TEACHER!!!!!

                  Dr. Carter is extremely smart and his quirkiness helps students pay attention. However, he is often confusing and also doesn't teach much before the relevant homework assignments. My favorite thing was that he gave daily quizzes.. If I bombed one, then I could easily make up for it.

                  Dr. Carter is a great teacher. I got an A in his Cal 1 class and am expecting an A in Cal 2. I took Dr. Bulka for Cal 2 originally and had no idea how to do anything and failed the class. He tells a lot of stories and does a great job of relating difficult concepts to simpler things.

                  Dr Carter is awesome and we should all strive to be more like him! Admittedly he is a very non linear thinker which makes his train of thought hard to follow for some. If you keep your mind open when listening to his lectures and ACTUALLY DO THE HOMEWORK you will get an A or B.

                  I would start off by saying that Dr. Carter is the worst teacher at south, but he never taught one lesson so I can't call him a teacher. Seriously all class time was spent going over home work problems but nothing was ever taught. You will probably get a C because even though your average was an F most likely everyone else's was too.

                  Dr. Carter is not a great lecturer and confuses the students often. His quizzes came from the homework. But he makes his tests tricky. However, he is quiet helpful during office hours and really wants his students to learn something.

                  Dr. Carter is a pretty good professor for math. He speaks in proofs and dosen&quot;t do a lot of examples, so if you take his class with a solutions manual, you will be fine.  He is extremely helpful outside of class and tries to joke a lot, so it keeps class interesting.  All in all, I would take him again.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Utah:













Does J Scott Carter carry a valid contracting license?



Contractors in Utah are required to be licensed to perform work on residential properties. The Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing issues over fifty separate license classifications to contractors. Licensing standards in Utah are very strict, offering homeowners peace of mind when hiring contractors. Always check a contractor's references to avoid problems during a construction project. 
J Scott Carter currently holds license 107322-5301 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Utah?



Utah requires contractors to pass a business and law exam, as well as a trade exam to become licensed. Six hours of continuing education is required to maintain a license in the state. 











Your liability risk when hiring J Scott Carter



Utah requires licensed contractors to carry workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of both insurance certificates for your records before the start of any work.











Financial recourse when hiring J Scott Carter



Licensed contractors in Utah must obtain a surety bond before performing work on residential properties. Home owners can file a claim against this bond to recoup losses or damages in the event of faulty work.











What else should I know before hiring J Scott Carter



Utah requires license applicants to submit a credit report with their application.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Utah, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Boost productivity with exact positioning
Integrated laser projection systems for both 2D and 3D applications providing precision alignment. Allows for projection of laser patterns onto complex curved surfaces in complete 3D images, suitable for mold composite layup, wind turbine blade production, vehicle construction, aerospace and a variety of manufacturing processes.







Carter lights the way to greater accuracy
A full offering of high powered line lasers, both red and green, suitable for any application requiring a clean crisp line for visual alignment. These lasers carry a full two-year warranty, are waterproof and come in a variety of line lengths, optics and mounts.







The Next Evolution in Steadyrest Work Support Systems
This system is compatible with a range of lathe sizes from mini to 20" all with one unit. The system is lightweight, yet very robust. The system can be split open to access or remove the work piece as well as converting it from Steadyrest to Bowlrest configurations.







Spend more time cutting and less time adjusting
Carter Upgrade conversion kits increase your saws performance through the use of sealed ball bearing roller guides or Tefloy™ lubricated block support guides. This provides your saw with reduced blade friction, improved cutting accuracy, and is adjustable for various blade widths. Our bearing guides have no wear surfaces which means that until you need to change the blade size you won’t have to adjust your guides, so spend more time woodworking and less time adjusting.







Innovative new Hollowing System from Carter
The Hollow Roller™ system is a complete, easy to set-up turnkey hollowing system that allows the operator to focus on the work and art of the vessel being turned versus on the system. The boring bar is completely captive and incorporates a full sealed bearing lubrication free roller system that eliminates the drag on the bar, thus enabling a smoother flowing motion to all tool movements.
