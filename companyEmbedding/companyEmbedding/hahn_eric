History[edit]
Founding[edit]
The company was founded in June 2002 by Eric Hahn, formerly the CTO of Netscape Communications. It launched July 21, 2003, after raising a $7 million Series A funding round, releasing its first product, and lining up six customers as references, and was backed by venture investors Benchmark Capital and Stanford University.[1] An additional $9 million in Series B funding led by New York-based RRE Ventures was announced in October, 2003.[2]
Proofpoint became a publicly traded company in April 2012. At the time of its initial public offering (IPO), the company's shares traded at $13 apiece; investors purchased more than 6.3 million shares through the IPO, raising more than $80 million.[3]

Proofpoint Headquarters, Sunnyvale California


Product History[edit]
The company's first product was the Proofpoint Protection Server for medium and large businesses. It incorporated what was described as "MLX Technology", proprietary machine learning algorithms applied to the problem of accurately identifying spam email using 10,000 different attributes to differentiate between spam and valid email. The company joined dozens of other anti-spam software providers[1] in a business opportunity fueled by an exponential increase in spam volume that was threatening worker productivity, making spam a top business priority.[4] According to the 2004 National Technology Readiness Survey by the Robert H. Smith School of Business and Rockbridge Associates, Inc, the cost of spam in terms of lost productivity had reached $21.58 billion annually.[5] The first Proofpoint Protection Server product upgrade was announced in November 2003 and expanded the number of spam detection attributes to more than 50,000.[6]
Encryption products spurred by HIPAA[edit]
In 2004, strict new regulations governing financial disclosures and the privacy of health care data prompted Proofpoint to begin developing new products that would automatically identify and intercept outbound email containing sensitive information.[7]
In March, 2004, Proofpoint introduced its first hardware appliance, the P-Series Message Protection Appliance (later renamed Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway), using a hardened Linux kernel and Proofpoint's Protection Server 2.0 software.[8] It was tested by Infoworld and found to stop 94% of spam.[9]
Another product introduction in November, 2004 included Protection Server 3.0, with Email Firewall and MLX-based Dynamic Reputation Analysis, and the Content Security Suite, plug-in modules designed for scanning outbound messages and their attachments to assist in compliance with data protection regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley. In combination, this was known as the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Appliance. It was reviewed by ChannelWeb ProofPoint Appliance Stands Guard At E-Mail Gate, ChannelWeb, Nov 26, 2004, which observed that it used a "combination of technologies: policy-based management, a spam-filtering engine and adaptive learning technology".
Proofpoint introduced a new product, the Network Content Sentry, as an add-on appliance to the Content Security Suite in August, 2005.[10] Designed to monitor online messaging other than email, the appliance monitors Web mail, message boards, blogs and FTP-based communications. Proofpoint also introduced policy-based email encryption features, using identity-based encryption technology licensed from Voltage Security.
Virtual appliance development[edit]
In a step towards simpler operational requirements, the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Virtual Edition was released in April 2007. The product runs as a virtual appliance on a host running VMware's virtual server software.[11] Moving a dedicated hardware appliance to a virtual server eliminates problems associated with proprietary hardware and reduces upgrade costs,[12] though it does require knowledge of VMware's virtual server architecture.
Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway V5.0 was released in June 2007, and was based on a new, integrated architecture, combining all its capabilities into a single platform.[13] It could be run either as a dedicated appliance, virtual appliance, or software suite.
ICSA Labs, an independent division of Verizon Business, announced in April 2007, that it had certified six anti-spam products under their new testing program, one of which was the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway. The goal of ICSA Labs' anti-spam product testing and certification is to evaluate product effectiveness in detecting and removing spam. The guidelines also address how well the products recognize e-mail messages from legitimate sources.[14]
Software as a Service[edit]
Moving into the software-as-a-service business, Proofpoint introduced Proofpoint on Demand, a hosted version of its email security and data loss prevention offerings.[15] In May, 2008, the company’s hosted offerings were expanded with the introduction of Proofpoint on Demand—Standard Edition.[16] The product is targeted at small-to-medium size businesses that need email security but do not run their own servers or have on-site IT personnel.
Products[edit]
Proofpoint products are designed to solve three business problems: advanced cybersecurity threats, regulatory compliance, and brand-impostor fraud (which it calls “digital risk”). These products work across email, social media, mobile devices, and the cloud. [17][18][19][20]
Email Security[edit]
In June 2008, Proofpoint acquired Fortiva, Inc., a provider of on-demand Email archiving software for legal discovery, regulatory compliance and email storage management.[26] Fortiva used Exchange journaling to automatically archive all internal and external communications so that end users can search all archived messages, including attachments, directly from a search folder in Outlook.[21]
Cybersecurity[edit]
Proofpoint’s security portfolio includes products that stop both traditional cyberattacks (delivered via malicious attachments and URLs) and socially engineered attacks—such as business email compromise (BEC) and credential phishing—that do not use malware.[22] It uses a blend of sandbox analysis, reputational analysis, automated threat data, human threat intelligence and attributes such as sender/recipient relationship, headers, and content, and more to detect potential threats. Automated encryption, data-loss prevention and forensics-gathering tools are designed to speed incident response and mitigate the damage and costs of any threats that do get through. The portfolio also includes protection from social-media account takeovers, harmful mobile apps, and rogue Wi-Fi networks.
Regulatory Compliance[edit]
Proofpoint’s compliance products are designed to reduce the manual labor involved in identifying potentially sensitive data, managing and supervising it in compliance with government and industry rules, and producing  it quickly in e-discovery legal requests.[23]
Digital Risk[edit]
Proofpoint’s digital risk products are aimed at companies seeking to stop cybercriminals from impersonating their brand to harm customers, partners, and the brand’s reputation. Its email digital risk portfolio includes authentication technology to prevent email domain spoofing.[24] On social media, it stops scams in which fraudsters create fake customer-service accounts to find people seeking help over social media and trick them into handing over account credentials or visiting a malicious website.[25] And in mobile, it finds counterfeit apps distributed through mobile app stores.[26]
In the 2016 Forrester Wave™ for Digital Risk Monitoring, Q3 2016 the Proofpoint digital risk / social media product was included in an evaluation of the nine top vendors in this emerging market. These solutions monitor “digital”—i.e., social, mobile, web, and dark web—channels to detect, prevent, malicious or unwanted content from undermining organizational efforts to build brand across all major social media platforms.[20] On Oct 23, 2014 Proofpoint acquired Nexgate, Inc. a social media and security compliance vendor. On Nov 4, 2015 Proofpoint acquired Socialware Inc a compliance workflow & content capture and review technology company.
Recognition[edit]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
The company was founded in June 2002 by Eric Hahn, formerly the CTO of Netscape Communications. It launched July 21, 2003, after raising a $7 million Series A funding round, releasing its first product, and lining up six customers as references, and was backed by venture investors Benchmark Capital and Stanford University.[1] An additional $9 million in Series B funding led by New York-based RRE Ventures was announced in October, 2003.[2]
Proofpoint became a publicly traded company in April 2012. At the time of its initial public offering (IPO), the company's shares traded at $13 apiece; investors purchased more than 6.3 million shares through the IPO, raising more than $80 million.[3]

Product History[edit]
The company's first product was the Proofpoint Protection Server for medium and large businesses. It incorporated what was described as "MLX Technology", proprietary machine learning algorithms applied to the problem of accurately identifying spam email using 10,000 different attributes to differentiate between spam and valid email. The company joined dozens of other anti-spam software providers[1] in a business opportunity fueled by an exponential increase in spam volume that was threatening worker productivity, making spam a top business priority.[4] According to the 2004 National Technology Readiness Survey by the Robert H. Smith School of Business and Rockbridge Associates, Inc, the cost of spam in terms of lost productivity had reached $21.58 billion annually.[5] The first Proofpoint Protection Server product upgrade was announced in November 2003 and expanded the number of spam detection attributes to more than 50,000.[6]
Encryption products spurred by HIPAA[edit]
In 2004, strict new regulations governing financial disclosures and the privacy of health care data prompted Proofpoint to begin developing new products that would automatically identify and intercept outbound email containing sensitive information.[7]
In March, 2004, Proofpoint introduced its first hardware appliance, the P-Series Message Protection Appliance (later renamed Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway), using a hardened Linux kernel and Proofpoint's Protection Server 2.0 software.[8] It was tested by Infoworld and found to stop 94% of spam.[9]
Another product introduction in November, 2004 included Protection Server 3.0, with Email Firewall and MLX-based Dynamic Reputation Analysis, and the Content Security Suite, plug-in modules designed for scanning outbound messages and their attachments to assist in compliance with data protection regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley. In combination, this was known as the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Appliance. It was reviewed by ChannelWeb ProofPoint Appliance Stands Guard At E-Mail Gate, ChannelWeb, Nov 26, 2004, which observed that it used a "combination of technologies: policy-based management, a spam-filtering engine and adaptive learning technology".
Proofpoint introduced a new product, the Network Content Sentry, as an add-on appliance to the Content Security Suite in August, 2005.[10] Designed to monitor online messaging other than email, the appliance monitors Web mail, message boards, blogs and FTP-based communications. Proofpoint also introduced policy-based email encryption features, using identity-based encryption technology licensed from Voltage Security.
Virtual appliance development[edit]
In a step towards simpler operational requirements, the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Virtual Edition was released in April 2007. The product runs as a virtual appliance on a host running VMware's virtual server software.[11] Moving a dedicated hardware appliance to a virtual server eliminates problems associated with proprietary hardware and reduces upgrade costs,[12] though it does require knowledge of VMware's virtual server architecture.
Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway V5.0 was released in June 2007, and was based on a new, integrated architecture, combining all its capabilities into a single platform.[13] It could be run either as a dedicated appliance, virtual appliance, or software suite.
ICSA Labs, an independent division of Verizon Business, announced in April 2007, that it had certified six anti-spam products under their new testing program, one of which was the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway. The goal of ICSA Labs' anti-spam product testing and certification is to evaluate product effectiveness in detecting and removing spam. The guidelines also address how well the products recognize e-mail messages from legitimate sources.[14]
Software as a Service[edit]
Moving into the software-as-a-service business, Proofpoint introduced Proofpoint on Demand, a hosted version of its email security and data loss prevention offerings.[15] In May, 2008, the company’s hosted offerings were expanded with the introduction of Proofpoint on Demand—Standard Edition.[16] The product is targeted at small-to-medium size businesses that need email security but do not run their own servers or have on-site IT personnel.
Products[edit]
Proofpoint products are designed to solve three business problems: advanced cybersecurity threats, regulatory compliance, and brand-impostor fraud (which it calls “digital risk”). These products work across email, social media, mobile devices, and the cloud. [17][18][19][20]
Email Security[edit]
In June 2008, Proofpoint acquired Fortiva, Inc., a provider of on-demand Email archiving software for legal discovery, regulatory compliance and email storage management.[26] Fortiva used Exchange journaling to automatically archive all internal and external communications so that end users can search all archived messages, including attachments, directly from a search folder in Outlook.[21]
Cybersecurity[edit]
Proofpoint’s security portfolio includes products that stop both traditional cyberattacks (delivered via malicious attachments and URLs) and socially engineered attacks—such as business email compromise (BEC) and credential phishing—that do not use malware.[22] It uses a blend of sandbox analysis, reputational analysis, automated threat data, human threat intelligence and attributes such as sender/recipient relationship, headers, and content, and more to detect potential threats. Automated encryption, data-loss prevention and forensics-gathering tools are designed to speed incident response and mitigate the damage and costs of any threats that do get through. The portfolio also includes protection from social-media account takeovers, harmful mobile apps, and rogue Wi-Fi networks.
Regulatory Compliance[edit]
Proofpoint’s compliance products are designed to reduce the manual labor involved in identifying potentially sensitive data, managing and supervising it in compliance with government and industry rules, and producing  it quickly in e-discovery legal requests.[23]
Digital Risk[edit]
Proofpoint’s digital risk products are aimed at companies seeking to stop cybercriminals from impersonating their brand to harm customers, partners, and the brand’s reputation. Its email digital risk portfolio includes authentication technology to prevent email domain spoofing.[24] On social media, it stops scams in which fraudsters create fake customer-service accounts to find people seeking help over social media and trick them into handing over account credentials or visiting a malicious website.[25] And in mobile, it finds counterfeit apps distributed through mobile app stores.[26]
In the 2016 Forrester Wave™ for Digital Risk Monitoring, Q3 2016 the Proofpoint digital risk / social media product was included in an evaluation of the nine top vendors in this emerging market. These solutions monitor “digital”—i.e., social, mobile, web, and dark web—channels to detect, prevent, malicious or unwanted content from undermining organizational efforts to build brand across all major social media platforms.[20] On Oct 23, 2014 Proofpoint acquired Nexgate, Inc. a social media and security compliance vendor. On Nov 4, 2015 Proofpoint acquired Socialware Inc a compliance workflow & content capture and review technology company.

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
The company was founded in June 2002 by Eric Hahn, formerly the CTO of Netscape Communications. It launched July 21, 2003, after raising a $7 million Series A funding round, releasing its first product, and lining up six customers as references, and was backed by venture investors Benchmark Capital and Stanford University.[1] An additional $9 million in Series B funding led by New York-based RRE Ventures was announced in October, 2003.[2]
Proofpoint became a publicly traded company in April 2012. At the time of its initial public offering (IPO), the company's shares traded at $13 apiece; investors purchased more than 6.3 million shares through the IPO, raising more than $80 million.[3]

Product History[edit]
The company's first product was the Proofpoint Protection Server for medium and large businesses. It incorporated what was described as "MLX Technology", proprietary machine learning algorithms applied to the problem of accurately identifying spam email using 10,000 different attributes to differentiate between spam and valid email. The company joined dozens of other anti-spam software providers[1] in a business opportunity fueled by an exponential increase in spam volume that was threatening worker productivity, making spam a top business priority.[4] According to the 2004 National Technology Readiness Survey by the Robert H. Smith School of Business and Rockbridge Associates, Inc, the cost of spam in terms of lost productivity had reached $21.58 billion annually.[5] The first Proofpoint Protection Server product upgrade was announced in November 2003 and expanded the number of spam detection attributes to more than 50,000.[6]
Encryption products spurred by HIPAA[edit]
In 2004, strict new regulations governing financial disclosures and the privacy of health care data prompted Proofpoint to begin developing new products that would automatically identify and intercept outbound email containing sensitive information.[7]
In March, 2004, Proofpoint introduced its first hardware appliance, the P-Series Message Protection Appliance (later renamed Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway), using a hardened Linux kernel and Proofpoint's Protection Server 2.0 software.[8] It was tested by Infoworld and found to stop 94% of spam.[9]
Another product introduction in November, 2004 included Protection Server 3.0, with Email Firewall and MLX-based Dynamic Reputation Analysis, and the Content Security Suite, plug-in modules designed for scanning outbound messages and their attachments to assist in compliance with data protection regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley. In combination, this was known as the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Appliance. It was reviewed by ChannelWeb ProofPoint Appliance Stands Guard At E-Mail Gate, ChannelWeb, Nov 26, 2004, which observed that it used a "combination of technologies: policy-based management, a spam-filtering engine and adaptive learning technology".
Proofpoint introduced a new product, the Network Content Sentry, as an add-on appliance to the Content Security Suite in August, 2005.[10] Designed to monitor online messaging other than email, the appliance monitors Web mail, message boards, blogs and FTP-based communications. Proofpoint also introduced policy-based email encryption features, using identity-based encryption technology licensed from Voltage Security.
Virtual appliance development[edit]
In a step towards simpler operational requirements, the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Virtual Edition was released in April 2007. The product runs as a virtual appliance on a host running VMware's virtual server software.[11] Moving a dedicated hardware appliance to a virtual server eliminates problems associated with proprietary hardware and reduces upgrade costs,[12] though it does require knowledge of VMware's virtual server architecture.
Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway V5.0 was released in June 2007, and was based on a new, integrated architecture, combining all its capabilities into a single platform.[13] It could be run either as a dedicated appliance, virtual appliance, or software suite.
ICSA Labs, an independent division of Verizon Business, announced in April 2007, that it had certified six anti-spam products under their new testing program, one of which was the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway. The goal of ICSA Labs' anti-spam product testing and certification is to evaluate product effectiveness in detecting and removing spam. The guidelines also address how well the products recognize e-mail messages from legitimate sources.[14]
Software as a Service[edit]
Moving into the software-as-a-service business, Proofpoint introduced Proofpoint on Demand, a hosted version of its email security and data loss prevention offerings.[15] In May, 2008, the company’s hosted offerings were expanded with the introduction of Proofpoint on Demand—Standard Edition.[16] The product is targeted at small-to-medium size businesses that need email security but do not run their own servers or have on-site IT personnel.
Products[edit]
Proofpoint products are designed to solve three business problems: advanced cybersecurity threats, regulatory compliance, and brand-impostor fraud (which it calls “digital risk”). These products work across email, social media, mobile devices, and the cloud. [17][18][19][20]
Email Security[edit]
In June 2008, Proofpoint acquired Fortiva, Inc., a provider of on-demand Email archiving software for legal discovery, regulatory compliance and email storage management.[26] Fortiva used Exchange journaling to automatically archive all internal and external communications so that end users can search all archived messages, including attachments, directly from a search folder in Outlook.[21]
Cybersecurity[edit]
Proofpoint’s security portfolio includes products that stop both traditional cyberattacks (delivered via malicious attachments and URLs) and socially engineered attacks—such as business email compromise (BEC) and credential phishing—that do not use malware.[22] It uses a blend of sandbox analysis, reputational analysis, automated threat data, human threat intelligence and attributes such as sender/recipient relationship, headers, and content, and more to detect potential threats. Automated encryption, data-loss prevention and forensics-gathering tools are designed to speed incident response and mitigate the damage and costs of any threats that do get through. The portfolio also includes protection from social-media account takeovers, harmful mobile apps, and rogue Wi-Fi networks.
Regulatory Compliance[edit]
Proofpoint’s compliance products are designed to reduce the manual labor involved in identifying potentially sensitive data, managing and supervising it in compliance with government and industry rules, and producing  it quickly in e-discovery legal requests.[23]
Digital Risk[edit]
Proofpoint’s digital risk products are aimed at companies seeking to stop cybercriminals from impersonating their brand to harm customers, partners, and the brand’s reputation. Its email digital risk portfolio includes authentication technology to prevent email domain spoofing.[24] On social media, it stops scams in which fraudsters create fake customer-service accounts to find people seeking help over social media and trick them into handing over account credentials or visiting a malicious website.[25] And in mobile, it finds counterfeit apps distributed through mobile app stores.[26]
In the 2016 Forrester Wave™ for Digital Risk Monitoring, Q3 2016 the Proofpoint digital risk / social media product was included in an evaluation of the nine top vendors in this emerging market. These solutions monitor “digital”—i.e., social, mobile, web, and dark web—channels to detect, prevent, malicious or unwanted content from undermining organizational efforts to build brand across all major social media platforms.[20] On Oct 23, 2014 Proofpoint acquired Nexgate, Inc. a social media and security compliance vendor. On Nov 4, 2015 Proofpoint acquired Socialware Inc a compliance workflow & content capture and review technology company.
Recognition[edit]

Driving Components in Prime Vendor Agreements for Restaurants | By Eric Hahn – Hospitality Net

Industry Update




Opinion Article 3 December 2005Driving Components in Prime Vendor Agreements for Restaurants
By Eric  Hahn

Comments
Deciding whether a “prime vendor contract” is a wise choice in your purchasing process is something that confronts many operators today.

By definition, a “prime vendor contract” is a pricing mechanism that distributors offer to operators for the items they frequently buy. Generally, the distributor seeks to obtain a high percentage of the operator’s purchasing power, in exchange for better or preferred pricing for key menu items. Like any contract, a prime vendor contract is a mutual agreement that is intended to benefit both parties.

Prime vendor contract pricing is formulated on the following criteria:


Cost-Plus pricing – (also called “fixed price”) which is cost of the product plus a flat markup for items that tend to be market stable such as canned, frozen and dry goods for the duration of the contract

Cost-Percentage pricing – which is cost of the product plus a percentage used for high volume products that are prone to volatile market conditions such as produce, dairy, meat and seafood

Cost Pricing – which is when the distributor is willing to sell you items at cost.

Market Pricing – Used on items that tend to fluctuate heavily throughout the year, such as produce, seafood, meats, and dairy

When negotiating a prime vendor contract, an operator needs to be aware of the conditions that apply to the distributor in order to get the product to the establishment. Distributors face challenges in delivering product that are out of their control, such as weather, fuel costs, road conditions and routing changes. Any part of these components can affect the costs of the products, delivery dates or times, or possibly the amount of product that can be delivered.
On the other hand, distributors should always have a good understanding of the nature of the establishments they serve. Restaurateurs are always concerned about quality, freshness, prices and availability of their products, but most importantly distributors should always understand that service is paramount to retaining their customers’ satisfaction.
Negotiating a prime vendor agreement should be based upon the service aspects of the agreement. The most important elements of the service component are:

Terms of payment and / or credit lines
Ability to communicate with sales representative and when
Understanding of unit weights and measures of the products being ordered
Ability to resolve errors in the orders

Deciding whether a prime vendor agreement is the right choice for your establishment, will depend on the nature of your restaurant, the menu, and the purchasing habits of the decision-maker. If your operation is small, seasonal, or ethnic (i.e. Mexican, Italian, Greek or Chinese), a prime vendor agreement may be something to reconsider. Operations of these types often use small quantities of product, or they need larger amounts of specialty foods to meet their menu demands. Because prime vendor contracts are typically offered by larger, broadline distributors such as Sysco or U.S. Foods, specialty food items may be special order items and not ordinarily stocked in their warehousing facilities.
If you decide on a prime vendor contract for your establishment, determine whether or not the following conditions apply with the distributor you choose to do business with:
Financial rewards or “kickbacks” to the person in charge of purchasing: If the person placing the orders is getting financial rewards for buying key items, rather than expected items, your prime costs may increase.
Degree of labor and time investment shopping for products: Always communicate and interact with the sales representative. Eliminating affective communication in lieu of saving time placing orders can be a big mistake. Operators have a right to be analytical and carefully audit their invoices – utilize this option in your contract!
Length of the contract: Always pay attention to the costs of items over time. If cost + plus pricing is prominently negotiated in the contract, those items should not change in price over the duration of the contract. If cost + percentage or market pricing is prominently negotiated in your contract, always ask the distributor when these prices are most vulnerable during the year, and plan your menu accordingly.
In summary, the prime vendor agreement is intended to be an equitable arrangement between the operator and the vendor. With great emphasis, the relationship between the vendor and the operator must be mutually respectful and expected to benefit both parties over a length of time. Like any marriage, both sides have a job to do, and both seek profitable results over the length of the contract. Weighing all the options pointed out in this article will allow you to make wise and informed decisions on your purchasing habits.
