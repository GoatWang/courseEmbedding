Advent International GPE VIII closes at $13 bln


March 22, 2016
By Luisa Beltran
 Follow @LuisaRBeltran





Advent International said Tuesday that its eighth flagship fund closed at $13 billion, above its $12 billion target. Advent International GPE VIII LP will invest in buyouts, recapitalizations and growth equity transactions, primarily in Europe and North America and selectively in other regions such as Asia and Latin America. Advent’s prior fund closed on $10.8 billion in 2012.
PRESS RELEASE
BOSTON and LONDON, March 22, 2016 – Advent International, one of the largest and
most experienced global private equity investors, today announced that it has completed
fundraising for Advent International GPE VIII Limited Partnership (“GPE VIII” or the “Fund”),
reaching its hard cap of $13 billion (€12 billion) after six months in the market. Advent’s
previous global fund, GPE VII, closed on $10.8 billion (€8.5 billion) in 2012.
 
GPE (Global Private Equity) VIII will pursue the same strategy as its predecessor funds,
investing in buyouts, recapitalizations and growth equity transactions, primarily in Europe
and North America and selectively in other regions such as Asia and Latin America. The
Fund will focus on five industry sectors in which Advent has significant experience and
knowledge: (1) business and financial services; (2) healthcare; (3) industrial; (4) retail,
consumer and leisure; and (5) technology, media and telecom.
 
Across its target sectors and regions, Advent will seek to invest in well-positioned companies 





with the potential for further operational improvement and partner with management teams
to create value through revenue and earnings growth.
 
“We are pleased with the strong support we received from both existing and new investors,” said
David Mussafer, a Managing Partner at Advent International in Boston. Mr. Mussafer is one of 14
Managing Partners at Advent. “We believe that our success is a result of our long-established
sector focus, global footprint and network, private partnership model, and the significant
operational resources and expertise we apply to our investments. This solid foundation positions
us well to continue to find and build successful businesses around the world.”
 
GPE VIII will be invested by a team of more than 130 investment professionals across
Europe, North America and Asia. These individuals can leverage the expertise and networks
of additional professionals from Advent’s Latin American Private Equity Fund (LAPEF)
program, which focuses on investments throughout Latin America.
 
“Our global team is one of the largest and most experienced in the private equity industry,”
said Ralf Huep, a Managing Partner at Advent International in Frankfurt. “This platform
allows us to generate a broad set of opportunities, invest selectively in the most compelling
businesses and drive operational improvement and growth to create value.”
 
“GPE VIII received commitments from a diverse base of institutional investors across the 





globe,” said Johanna Barr, a Managing Director and Global Co-Head of Limited Partner
Services at Advent International in London. “Approximately 90% of the committed capital
came from limited partners in Advent’s prior funds, with the remaining commitments provided
by a select number of new investors.”
 
“We are fortunate to have a large, loyal group of investors and greatly appreciate their
support in making this a successful fundraising,” said Robert Weaver, a Managing Director
and Global Co-Head of Limited Partner Services at Advent International in New York. “We
will work to earn their continued commitment by maintaining our focus on value creation.”
 
STRONG 25-YEAR TRACK RECORD
 
Advent’s GPE program has established a strong track record of investments and exits over
seven generations of funds and several economic and private equity cycles. Since 1990, the
program has invested in 228 private equity transactions in 29 countries and fully or
substantially realized 190 of those investments.
 
Recent investments by the GPE program include Ammeraal Beltech, Corialis, Hypo Group
Alpe Adria and Istituto Centrale delle Banche Popolari Italiane (ICBPI) in Europe; Distribution
International, Genoa and Noosa in North America; and Crompton Greaves Consumer
Electricals, The Learning Lab and QuEST Global Services in Asia.
 
Recent IPOs and sales of companies in the GPE program include Casa Reha, Douglas, 





Equiniti, GFKL Financial Services, Priory Group and Worldpay in Europe; Bojangles’, Party
City and TransUnion in North America; and CARE Hospitals in Asia.
 
KEY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
 
Over its long history of international investing, Advent has developed a number of core
capabilities which it believes provide significant competitive advantages throughout the
investment life cycle:
 

Long-established sector focus – Advent has been investing in each of its five target

sectors for 25 years and has made an average of over 60 investments per sector
worldwide. This expertise enables the firm to identify attractive investment opportunities in
higher-growth sub-sectors, develop and implement effective value creation plans and
position companies favorably for exit.

Global footprint and network – With over 170 investment professionals in 10 countries

on four continents, Advent brings to its investments both a broad global perspective and
deep knowledge of local markets. This platform allows the firm to help businesses grow
through international expansion, cross-border acquisitions and other initiatives.

Private partnership model – Advent remains a traditional private partnership owned and

operated by 45 partners and governed by a group of 14 Managing Partners. The firm
believes its ownership structure and economic incentives ensure that it is closely aligned 





with the interests of its investors.

Significant operational resources and expertise – To complement its deal team’s

capabilities, Advent draws on additional operational and sub-sector expertise, including an
in-house Portfolio Support Group and over 70 highly experienced external Operating
Partners. These Operating Partners, typically former CEOs, work alongside Advent’s
sector teams and management to support the development of companies through their
industry knowledge, operational know-how, leadership experience and contact networks.
 
In addition to the GPE program, Advent is currently investing its sixth Latin American private
equity fund, LAPEF VI. Capitalized at $2.1 billion, the 2015-vintage fund focuses on buyouts
and growth equity investments in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Chile and other countries
in the region.
 
This press release is not an offer or solicitation of an offer, or an invitation or inducement, to
invest in any Advent International fund. No person may invest in any Advent International
fund except in accordance with and subject to the terms of the applicable fund
documentation and applicable law.

When it comes to guitar gear, guitar accessories are by far the deepest and most varied subject out there. Though sometimes overlooked for their importance in your tone and performance, can you imagine going to a gig without a guitar case, picks, cables, or a tuner? The fact is, if you play guitar, you need guitar accessories. Knowing which ones are right for you is a process that Sweetwater is excited to help you with. So whether you're a beginner needing all the essentials or a touring pro wanting to upgrade parts on your favorite guitar, you've come to the right place.

Regardless of the style you prefer or the kind of guitar you play, you need accessories. Even a classical player who doesn't require any other gear than their guitar has to have a good-quality guitar case for transporting their instrument and a footstool. If you're an electric player the list grows quickly. When it's time to plug in, you want to make sure you have the right cables, a good stash of your favorite guitar picks, and a stand to keep your guitar safe whenever you're not around. All players need a good-quality tuner. And that's just scratching the surface.

So now you have the necessities. What about making sure you keep your guitar clean and in tip-top playing condition? Cleaning polish, setup tools, and fretboard oils are just some of the products you should consider when maintaining your instrument. And every acoustic player should make sure you have a way of maintaining your guitar's constant humidification needs. Sweetwater has plenty of guitar accessories by reputable brands, such as D'Adarrio, Big Bends, and Graph Tech to ensure your instrument plays like new, or better, for years to come.

Some genres and playing styles demand their own set of tools. Blues and country players will find a great assortment of metal, glass, and ceramic slides. An easy-to-use capo should be in every guitarist's case for on-the-fly key changes. And some cable manufacturers, such as Monster even craft cables for specific sounds and instruments.

One of the most fun types of guitar accessories are instrument upgrades. No player goes too far into their musical journey without being inspired to add a new twist to their rig or guitar. The most popular choice for guitarists is upgrading their instrument's pickups. Sweetwater has a huge selection of electric and acoustic pickups that are highly customized for different tones, techniques, and instruments. Do you run into tuning problems with your guitar? Try replacing your stock tuning machines with a high-quality set from Grover, Planet Waves, or Sperzel. And every guitar deserves the protection afforded by a set of strap locks.

Other than the guitar itself, accessories are the most necessary part of your rig. Not only is performing without them next to impossible, but many of them play a larger role in your tone than almost anything else in your signal chain. With so many options out there, we'd love to answer any questions you may have. Give one of our expert Sales Engineers a call. They'll take the time to get to know you, the music you make, and the gear you need. With a little digging, we're confident you'll find all the pieces you need to build your perfect guitar playing experience.

To get you started, here are a few points you might want to consider when choosing your ideal guitar.

Modern guitars can be acoustic, with steel or nylon strings, or electric. Most have six strings, but there are 12-string acoustic and electric guitars, as well as some contemporary 7-string and 8-string instruments. The ukulele, a small four-string instrument commonly associated with the Hawaiian islands, even falls in this category.

Electric guitars feature pickups and electronics that turn the vibration of the strings into an electrical signal that is then sent to an amplifier. They can be solidbody, semi-hollowbody, or hollowbody guitars. Electric guitars are used in many styles of music including rock, blues, country, jazz, funk, and more.

Acoustic guitars produce their sound naturally using the vibration of the strings and resonance of the body to create sound in the air. The guitar top, or soundboard, is a finely crafted and engineered element often made of spruce, cedar, or mahogany. The back and sides are typically made from mahogany, sapele, rosewood, or maple. Some acoustic guitars have pickups and electronics in case you need to plug into an amp or PA to get more volume or want to add effects with pedals.

A guitar amp is an amplifier optimized for reproducing electric guitar signals. There are two primary formats of guitar amps: heads and combos. Heads are just amplifiers and need to be connected to a separate speaker cabinet; whereas, combos are amplifiers with speakers built in. Amplifiers usually fall into three types: tube, solid state, or hybrid.

Guitar effects pedals can help you create and sculpt your perfect tone. Add distortion for big rock tones, and create cool nuances with delays, reverbs, wah, and more. You can purchase separate pedals for each effect or multi-effects units that house many effects.

Many people overlook the importance and vital role of guitar strings. They help your guitar sound, play, and even feel better. Old strings can cause intonation and tuning problems, while new strings can breathe new life into your guitar's sound and playability, keeping your guitar sounding its best. Some guitar strings are coated to resist the buildup of oil and dirt, prolonging the strings' useful life.

The ukulele is a small four-string instrument commonly associated with the Hawaiian Islands. The word ukulele actually translates to "leaping flea" in Hawaiian. Many ukuleles are built from the wood of the koa tree, which is found only in Hawaii and has a beautiful three-dimensional grain pattern. Ukes come in four sizes (from smallest to largest): soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone.

Advent was founded in Boston, Massachusetts as a spin-out from TA Associates by Peter Brooke. Brooke had founded TA Associates in 1968 after having expanded the venture capital operations of TA's parent Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day. In 1985, Advent raised its first fund – a $14 million corporate venture capital program for Nabisco.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
