Forget everything you’ve been taught about dieting. In Always Hungry?, renowned endocrinologist Dr. David Ludwig explains why traditional diets don’t work, and presents a radical new plan to help you lose weight without hunger, improve your health, and feel great.
For over two decades, Dr. Ludwig has been at the forefront of research into weight control. His groundbreaking studies show that overeating doesn’t make you fat; the process of getting fat makes you overeat.
Always Hungry? turns dieting on its head with a three-phase program that ignores calories and targets fat cells directly. The recipes and meal plan include luscious high-fat foods (like nuts and nut butters, full-fat dairy, avocados, and dark chocolate), savory proteins, and natural carbohydrates. This is dieting without deprivation.
Forget calories. Forget cravings. Forget dieting, Always Hungry? reveals a liberating new way to tame hunger and lose weight . . . for good.

TESTIMONIALS:"Always Hungry is a powerful book that breaks apart every myth about weight loss, and explains for the first time why we get fat and why we are always hungry."
Mark Hyman, MD, Director, Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Blood Sugar Solution
"For decades Dr. David Ludwig’s research has formed the backbone of other diet programs."
Andrew Weil, MD, Founder and Director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Arizona
"Dr. Ludwig explains why throwing out our calorie-counters and paying more attention to the quality of our diets can result in a healthier weight."
Professor Walter Willett, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and author of Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy
"Ludwig combines cutting-edge science and clinical experience into an achievable eating pattern that anyone could follow.”
Janet King, PhD, Executive Director, Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute and Chair, 2005 USDA Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee

Once in a generation a scientist comes along who tells a new story about why we are sick and how we can heal.
 Dr. David Ludwig is that scientist.

Featured Designer
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe


	 

	Regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of architecture, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s ‘less-is-more’ approach to design was the gold standard for many generations of modern architecture. His legendary career started humbly at his father’s stonemasonry business, giving him an early appreciation of material and structure.

Ludwig van Beethoven Composer of the Classical and Romantic Eras Britannica Beginner Bios 
This comprehensive biography of one of history’s greatest composers will bring Beethoven back to life for contemporary young readers. In addition to a biographical treatment of his life, a thorough assessment is made of Beethoven’s musical stylings and developments—all in language suitable for upper-elementary-level readers. Eighteenth-century drawings coupled with modern photographs show readers Beethoven’s world as it was during his lifetime and as it is today. Vocabulary boxes reinforce select on-topic words that may be unfamiliar to readers, while Quick Fact sidebars add interesting tidbits, encouraging readers to think beyond the text.

Product Story
Designer




Mies van der Rohe and his longtime collaborator Lilly Reich designed this lounge collection in 1927 for the Esters and Lange residences, designed by Mies, in Krefeld, Germany. A wonderful example of the syntax, skill and diversity of Mies’ work, the collection was originally specified in leather and reveals van der Rohe’s often-overlooked fondness for traditional furniture styles.
Recognizing the timeless appeal of the designs, KnollStudio brought the Krefeld Collection to production for the first time in 2003. Each piece is based on Lilly Reich’s original drawings, found in the Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Archive at the Museum of Modern Art. The introduction of the Krefeld Collection reflects Knoll’s celebration of timeless, enduring design, and underlines our continuing commitment to celebrate the legacy of Mies van der Rohe through his furniture.
 












Regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of architecture, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s ‘less-is-more’ approach to design was the gold standard for many generations of modern architecture. His legendary career started humbly at his father’s stonemasonry business, giving him an early appreciation of material and structure. From there he apprenticed with furniture designer Bruno Paul in Berlin before joining the office of Peter Behrens, an architect and painter at the forefront of the modern movement.
In 1912, Mies established his own office in Berlin. Through furniture, residential projects and extraordinary, yet unrealized concepts for skyscrapers, he gained recognition as a leader of the German modern movement. As such, he was selected to design the German Pavilion at the 1929 International Exposition in Barcelona.
Mies served as Vice President of the Deutsher Werkbund and Director of the Bauhaus from 1930 until it closed in 1933. He immigrated to the United States in 1938 to become the director of architecture at the Armour Institute (later the Illinois Institute of Technology). From his Chicago-based practice, Mies designed a portfolio of buildings that changed the face of American institutional architecture ― the most notable examples being the IIT campus and the Seagram Building in New York.

Knoll Designer Bios
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
b. Germany1886-1969

Regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of architecture, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s ‘less-is-more’ approach to design was the gold standard for many generations of modern architecture. His legendary career started humbly at his father’s stonemasonry business, giving him an early appreciation of material and structure. From there he apprenticed with furniture designer Bruno Paul in Berlin before joining the office of Peter Behrens, an architect and painter at the forefront of the modern movement.

In 1912, Mies established his own office in Berlin. Through furniture, residential projects and extraordinary, yet unrealized concepts for skyscrapers, he gained recognition as a leader of the German modern movement. As such, he was selected to design the German Pavilion at the Barcelona Industrial Exposition of 1929. His design, a rhythmic arrangement of horizontal and vertical planes of glass, stone and metal was an experiment in free flowing space. With no discernible distinction between rooms or inside and outside, the design fundamentally challenged the architectural ‘boxes within a box’ standard of the time. Inside, Mies included the Barcelona Chair and Ottoman, designed to offer the King and Queen of Spain to a place to rest (they in fact never sat down). The Barcelona Pavilion and the chairs it contained are universally recognized as milestones of modern design.

Mies served as Vice President of the Deutsher Werkbund and Director of the Bauhaus from 1930 until it closed in 1933. He immigrated to the United States in 1938 to become the director of architecture at the Armour Institute (later the Illinois Institute of Technology). From his Chicago-based practice, Mies designed a portfolio of buildings that changed the face of American institutional architecture ― the most notable examples being the IIT campus and the Seagram Building in New York. While at IIT he befriended and mentored a young Florence Knoll. Florence has always credited Mies as her most influential instructor, and, in 1948, Mies granted Knoll exclusive rights to produce his furniture, including the Barcelona collection, the Brno chair, and MR series.
