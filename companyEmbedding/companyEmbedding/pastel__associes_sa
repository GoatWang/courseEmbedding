Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Ternium S.A. (NYSE:TX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.80)Consensus Price Target: $30.13 (0.05% downside)

Soft pastels contain less binder which gives them their velvety texture or "bloom". They contain more pigment, so the color is rich and can easily be blended or smudged with a finger or soft tool. The down side is that they are more delicate and can break easily. The same softness that makes them easy to blend also allows them to be accidentally smudged, so it's a good idea to use a spray fixative once you complete your work. Their soft texture creates more dust which can be a problem for some people.

Medium and Hard Pastels have less pigment, and more binder. They are firmer to work with, but the colors are not as vivid. They are good for making crisp lines and details as they can be sharpened to a point. They are often used for outlining or adding intricate details to work done in other media. Because hard pastels are less vivid, some pastel artists use them for background color. Hard pastels are recommended for preliminary sketching.

Pastel Questions and Answers 

Why should I use pastels?
How long have pastels been in use? Are they a serious fine arts medium?
Will pastels last? Are they archival?
What are the differences between hard pastels and soft pastels? Which is better?
What are the advantages of soft pastels?
What are the advantages of hard pastels?
What is the difference between hard/soft pastels and oil pastels?
What is the difference between student and artist grade pastels?
I've never used pastels before. Which is better for beginners?
How can pastels be cleaned?

 

Why should I use pastels? 
Pastels offer brilliant colors and high pigmentation. They are ideal for an artist who wishes to use intense color. They offer a lot of diversity, as they are mixable, wipeable, and water soluble. They can be used to achieve a wide range of drawing effects, from crisp lines to soft feathery textures.
They are easy to use when paint is not. Because there is no drying time, they make it easy to be spontaneous, and work at a moment's notice.
return to all questions

How long have pastels been in use? Are they a serious fine arts medium? 
Historically, pastels can be traced back to the 16th century and have been used by many famous artists, but they became especially popular in the 19th century. Delacroix, Manet, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, Whistler, Degas, and Mary Cassatt all used pastels for finished work as well as for sketches.
return to all questions

Will pastels last? Are they archival? 
Because they have no liquid binder, they do not degrade over time. Pastels are valued for their long lasting beauty. Choose a surface and support that will stand the test of time.
return to all questions

What are the differences between hard pastels and soft pastels? Which is better? 
The hardness or softness of a pastel depends on the amount of binder or filler in its makeup. There are advantages to each style of pastel.
return to all questions

What are the advantages of soft pastels? 
Soft pastels contain less binder, which gives them their velvety texture or “bloom.” They contain more pigment, so the color is rich and can easily be blended or smudged with a finger or soft tool. The down side is that they are more delicate and can break easily. The same softness that makes them easy to blend also allows them to be accidentally smudged, so it's a good idea to use a spray fixative once you complete your work. Their soft texture creates more dust, which can be a problem for some people.
return to all questions

What are the advantages of hard pastels? 
Hard pastels have less pigment, and more binder. They are firmer to work with, but the colors are not as vivid. They are good for making crisp lines and details as they can be sharpened to a point. They are often used for outlining or adding intricate details to work done in other media. Because hard pastels are less vivid, some pastel artists use them for background color. Hard pastels are recommended for preliminary sketching.
return to all questions

What is the difference between hard/soft pastels and oil pastels? 
The main difference is in the texture. Hard and soft pastels could be described as "chalky." Oil pastels might be described as having a "waxy" or crayon like consistency. They are cleaner, and do not rub off as much. They resist crumbling and do not pose any health risk in terms of breathing dust. Oil pastels are also more permanent and offer intense pigments. However, they are more difficult to blend and never fully harden. Therefore, oil pastels can be smudged in storage.
return to all questions

What is the difference between student and artist grade pastels? 
The difference lies in the amount of pigment and its quality, as well as the proportion and grade of binders, fillers, or clay.
return to all questions

I've never used pastels before. Which is better for beginners? 
Student grade pastels make a fine low-investment way to experiment with pastels. If you find you are serious about them, you can always upgrade later. Artist grade pastels have much more vivid colors, and offer a broader range of shades and hues.
return to all questions

How can pastels be cleaned? 
The easiest way to clean pastels is to wipe each stick individually with a paper towel. A good trick for pastels is to spread cornmeal in a container with a lid. Add a few pastels and put lid on container. Shake the container for 2-3 minutes. You will be amazed at how clean they will come out.

Blick Brand Drawing Materials
At Blick we pride ourselves on providing artist quality drawing materials at the most competitive price. See why our Blick brand Studio Artists' Colored Pencils, Studio Markers and Artists' Soft Pastels are an excellent choice for fine artists - even those on a budget.



 
Faber-Castell Pitt Pastel Pencils
Faber-Castell's Pitt Pastel Pencils are very suitable for lines, shading, and delicate color transitions, and also for extended areas. Use them for sketches, studies, portraits, still-lifes, and landscape drawings. They give a smooth flow of color without being used up too rapidly. Colors are lightfast and rich in pigment, allowing dense shading.



 
Rembrandt Soft Pastels
Rembrandt pastels are made from the purest pigments and mixed with the finest quality kaolin clay binder. No pigments containing heavy metals, such as cadmium, lead, and cobalt, are used in production which ensures that the pastels have no hard bits or sharp edges.



 
Tips and Techniques Using Prismacolor NuPastels and Soft Pastels
Prismacolor NuPastels aren't just for drawing. You'll be amazed by how many different techniques you can apply using Prismacolor NuPastel color sticks. See them in action in a variety of watercolor techniques, with solvents, even monoprinting! Watch this video and then try for yourself.



 
Tips for Mixed Media Art
Hilary shares several tips on working in mixed media. By following these simple rules, your work will remain stable and long lasting.




PanPastel Artists' Pastels
PanPastels were created to offer the artist a new tool for artistic expression by merging dry medium with wet, painterly technique. These highest quality pastels are rich, soft and lightfast and are contained in a truly unique pan that holds 35% more material than the average stick pastel.




PanPastel and Sofft Tools Tips and Techniques
See what distinquishes these high quality artists' pastels and tools from any other. Both products were invented for artists by artists and offer a new and unique way of painting with pastel. This video will show various applications, tips, and techniques.




Many Uses for Sofft Tools
Sofft tools were specifically developed for use with PanPastel soft pastels but are so versatile, inexpensive, and reusable, they can also be used with most water-based art and craft materials. Try using with watercolor, acrylic paint, glazes and with a variety of dry mediums, such as hard or soft traditional pastels and charcoal to create exciting new techniques, marks, and effects.



 
Unison Pastels
Unison Pastels were created by an artist for artists. These uniquely soft and highly pigmented sticks are individually rolled which eliminates hard spots and provides consistent texture and color.
