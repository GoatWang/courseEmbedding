Since 1991, our founder, Martin White, has maintained a long standing business relationship with Matt
              Telfer and subsequently BBX Operating, LLC. This relationship has greatly benefited DW Energy Group, LLC and our
              investing partners in the past and will continue into the future.              
Since 2009, DW Energy Group, LLC and BBX Operating, LLC have drilled and completed 29 wells in the
              Austin Chalk and Woodbine formations in southeast Texas. DW investing partners have participated in
              several wells that have returned over 100% of the invested capital and continue to distribute monthly income.

THE PLAY 
EAGLE FORD SHALE 
The Eagle Ford Shale formation in South Texas runs from the US-Mexico border north of Laredo in a narrow band extending northeast for several hundred miles to just north of Houston. It is located directly below the Austin Chalk. The average thickness of the Eagle Ford shale is about 475 feet. The formation produces both natural gas and oil, but it is the oil-producing and gas condensate areas that are hottest right now.

3.4 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil, 20.8 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural gas (eia.gov).
Over 1 million barrels of oil per day on average since 2014 (rrc.state.tx).
