Wizard World Inc., formerly known as Wizard Press and Wizard Entertainment, is a producer of multigenre fan conventions across North America. Starting out in 1991 as the publisher of one monthly magazine (Wizard), the company evolved into a multi-title publishing company with diversified interests in branded products and related convention operations.
By 2011 the company had discontinued its print division to focus exclusively on its convention business. Since then they have expanded to producing more than 20 annual conventions around North America.

History[edit]
Gareb Shamus founded Wizard magazine in January 1991 shortly after he graduated from college.[1] The company was originally based in Congers, New York.
Wizard purchased the Chicago Comicon in 1997 to expand from its core publishing business into trade/consumer conventions.[2]
In December 2007, Darren Sanchez was named Vice President of Production at Wizard Entertainment.[dead link][3]
Shamus was pushed out as company CEO in late 2011; his position was taken in March 2012 by John Macaluso.[1]
In 2015, the company lost $4.25 million in revenue and would be cutting back from 25 events to 19 events in 2016.[4] Less than a week after the announcement of the loss, John Macaluso resigned as CEO and was replaced by John Maatta.[5]
Publishing[edit]
Wizard started as a price guide to comics but evolved into focusing squarely on pop-culture, specifically targeting young adult males. (The magazine ultimately featured a price guide to comics and action figures in the back of the magazine.) With its high-end production values and embodiment of the comic speculator boom,[6] Wizard was an instant hit, with a monthly circulation of more than 100,000 copies.[7]
The magazine also spawned several ongoing magazines dedicated to similar interests, such as ToyFare: The Toy Magazine, for toys and action figures; Inquest Gamer, for collectible game cards; Anime Insider for anime and manga; and Toy Wishes for mainstream toy enthusiasts.
Anime Insider folded in the spring of 2009.[citation needed] On January 24, 2011, after 20 years of publication, the company announced that Wizard would cease print publication and become an all-digital magazine called Wizard World, launching in February 2011.[8] At that point Wizard Entertainment also ceased publication of its sister magazine, Toyfare.
Black Bull Entertainment[edit]
In 2000, Wizard founder Gareb Shamus forayed into the world of actual comic book publishing, creating the imprint Black Bull Entertainment, featuring several well-known creators, including Mark Waid, Chris Eliopoulos, Nelson DeCastro, and Garth Ennis. The first Black Bull title was the miniseries Gatecrasher.[9] Black Bull's titles included:

Just a Pilgrim
Shadowreavers
Gatecrasher

Conventions[edit]




The floor of the 2013 Wizard World New York Experience at Pier 36 in Manhattan


Just a few years after purchasing the Chicago Comicon in 1996, the now renamed "Wizard World Chicago" event boasted a weekend attendance of over 58,000 people.[10]
In May 2002, Wizard branched out from Chicago and produced "Wizard World East" at the Pennsylvania Convention Center.[11] And in 2003 the company produced "Wizard World Texas;" adding "Wizard World Los Angeles" in 2004,[12] and "Wizard World Boston" in 2005.
In 2005, Wizard announced that it would be holding a comic book convention in Atlanta from June 30–July 2, 2006, the same dates on which the long-running Charlotte, North Carolina-based Heroes Convention was scheduled to take place.[13] This caused an outcry amongst the comic book community, as Atlanta is only a four-hour drive from Charlotte, and several comic book creators voiced concerns about an attempt by a large, corporate event to force out an independent comic book convention.[14][15] As a result of the outcry, many comic book creators, including Warren Ellis, Bryan Hitch, Greg Rucka, Tony Harris, Scott Kurtz, Gaijin Studios and Art Adams, signed up to appear at HeroesCon 2006. In mid-August 2005, Wizard announced that it would be pushing back the Atlanta convention until 2007.[14]
In 2008, Wizard began adding an academic forum called "Wizard World University" to include scholarly panels at their conventions, beginning with the November convention in Arlington, Texas.[16]
In 2009, Wizard canceled the Texas event and postponed the Los Angeles convention.[17]
In 2009, Wizard World acquired the Big Apple Comic Con, New York City's longest-running comic book, science fiction, fantasy, horror, and pop culture convention. Wizard gave up the New York market after 2013 due to the dominance of the New York Comic Con, produced by ReedPOP, a division of Reed Exhibitions and Reed Elsevier. The Big Apple con is now back in the hands of its founder, Michael Carbonaro.[citation needed]
In 2009, Wizard World also acquired the Paradise Comics Toronto Comicon.[18][19]
Wizard Entertainment's 2010 North American Comic Con tour included city stops in Toronto,[dead link][20] Anaheim,[21] Philadelphia,[22] Chicago, New York City, Austin, and Boston.[citation needed]
Wizard's 2013 conventions included Portland Comic Con, St. Louis Comic Con, Philadelphia Comic Con, NYC Experience, Chicago Comic Con, Ohio Comic Con, Nashville Comic Con, Austin Comic Con, and New Orleans Comic Con.[23] In September 2013, Wizard World announced 7 new stops for the 2014 tour: Sacramento, Louisville, Minneapolis, Atlanta, San Antonio, Richmond, and Tulsa.[24]

Wizard World Inc., formerly known as Wizard Press and Wizard Entertainment, is a producer of multigenre fan conventions across North America. Starting out in 1991 as the publisher of one monthly magazine (Wizard), the company evolved into a multi-title publishing company with diversified interests in branded products and related convention operations.
By 2011 the company had discontinued its print division to focus exclusively on its convention business. Since then they have expanded to producing more than 20 annual conventions around North America.

History[edit]
Gareb Shamus founded Wizard magazine in January 1991 shortly after he graduated from college.[1] The company was originally based in Congers, New York.
Wizard purchased the Chicago Comicon in 1997 to expand from its core publishing business into trade/consumer conventions.[2]
In December 2007, Darren Sanchez was named Vice President of Production at Wizard Entertainment.[dead link][3]
Shamus was pushed out as company CEO in late 2011; his position was taken in March 2012 by John Macaluso.[1]
In 2015, the company lost $4.25 million in revenue and would be cutting back from 25 events to 19 events in 2016.[4] Less than a week after the announcement of the loss, John Macaluso resigned as CEO and was replaced by John Maatta.[5]
Publishing[edit]
Wizard started as a price guide to comics but evolved into focusing squarely on pop-culture, specifically targeting young adult males. (The magazine ultimately featured a price guide to comics and action figures in the back of the magazine.) With its high-end production values and embodiment of the comic speculator boom,[6] Wizard was an instant hit, with a monthly circulation of more than 100,000 copies.[7]
The magazine also spawned several ongoing magazines dedicated to similar interests, such as ToyFare: The Toy Magazine, for toys and action figures; Inquest Gamer, for collectible game cards; Anime Insider for anime and manga; and Toy Wishes for mainstream toy enthusiasts.
Anime Insider folded in the spring of 2009.[citation needed] On January 24, 2011, after 20 years of publication, the company announced that Wizard would cease print publication and become an all-digital magazine called Wizard World, launching in February 2011.[8] At that point Wizard Entertainment also ceased publication of its sister magazine, Toyfare.
Black Bull Entertainment[edit]
In 2000, Wizard founder Gareb Shamus forayed into the world of actual comic book publishing, creating the imprint Black Bull Entertainment, featuring several well-known creators, including Mark Waid, Chris Eliopoulos, Nelson DeCastro, and Garth Ennis. The first Black Bull title was the miniseries Gatecrasher.[9] Black Bull's titles included:

Just a Pilgrim
Shadowreavers
Gatecrasher

Conventions[edit]




The floor of the 2013 Wizard World New York Experience at Pier 36 in Manhattan


Just a few years after purchasing the Chicago Comicon in 1996, the now renamed "Wizard World Chicago" event boasted a weekend attendance of over 58,000 people.[10]
In May 2002, Wizard branched out from Chicago and produced "Wizard World East" at the Pennsylvania Convention Center.[11] And in 2003 the company produced "Wizard World Texas;" adding "Wizard World Los Angeles" in 2004,[12] and "Wizard World Boston" in 2005.
In 2005, Wizard announced that it would be holding a comic book convention in Atlanta from June 30–July 2, 2006, the same dates on which the long-running Charlotte, North Carolina-based Heroes Convention was scheduled to take place.[13] This caused an outcry amongst the comic book community, as Atlanta is only a four-hour drive from Charlotte, and several comic book creators voiced concerns about an attempt by a large, corporate event to force out an independent comic book convention.[14][15] As a result of the outcry, many comic book creators, including Warren Ellis, Bryan Hitch, Greg Rucka, Tony Harris, Scott Kurtz, Gaijin Studios and Art Adams, signed up to appear at HeroesCon 2006. In mid-August 2005, Wizard announced that it would be pushing back the Atlanta convention until 2007.[14]
In 2008, Wizard began adding an academic forum called "Wizard World University" to include scholarly panels at their conventions, beginning with the November convention in Arlington, Texas.[16]
In 2009, Wizard canceled the Texas event and postponed the Los Angeles convention.[17]
In 2009, Wizard World acquired the Big Apple Comic Con, New York City's longest-running comic book, science fiction, fantasy, horror, and pop culture convention. Wizard gave up the New York market after 2013 due to the dominance of the New York Comic Con, produced by ReedPOP, a division of Reed Exhibitions and Reed Elsevier. The Big Apple con is now back in the hands of its founder, Michael Carbonaro.[citation needed]
In 2009, Wizard World also acquired the Paradise Comics Toronto Comicon.[18][19]
Wizard Entertainment's 2010 North American Comic Con tour included city stops in Toronto,[dead link][20] Anaheim,[21] Philadelphia,[22] Chicago, New York City, Austin, and Boston.[citation needed]
Wizard's 2013 conventions included Portland Comic Con, St. Louis Comic Con, Philadelphia Comic Con, NYC Experience, Chicago Comic Con, Ohio Comic Con, Nashville Comic Con, Austin Comic Con, and New Orleans Comic Con.[23] In September 2013, Wizard World announced 7 new stops for the 2014 tour: Sacramento, Louisville, Minneapolis, Atlanta, San Antonio, Richmond, and Tulsa.[24]

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Wizard World Inc. has received 3.23 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A-.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
