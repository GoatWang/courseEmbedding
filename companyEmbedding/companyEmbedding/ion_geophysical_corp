History[edit]
Founded in 1968 as Input/Output (I/O), ION began as a provider of highly specialized, seismic source synchronization equipment. ION became publicly traded on NASDAQ in 1991, and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in November 1994 using the trading symbol "IO". Throughout the 1990s and 2000s ION experienced growth through a number of key acquisitions. In September 2007 Input/Output (I/O) officially changed its name to "ION" as part of a re-branding to better reflect the continuing evolution of the company from an equipment manufacturer to a broad-based, technology-focused seismic solutions provider.[1]
Key Acquisitions[edit]

1994 - cable and connector groups of Tescorp, Inc., provided cables to operate I/O systems
1995 - Western Geophysical's Exploration Products Group, marine seismic recording systems, vibrator source products, and geophone products
1997 - Green Mountain Geophysics, Inc. (GMG), developer of MESA software for seismic survey design and planning
1998 - DigiCOURSE, Inc., manufacturer of marine positioning products
2001 - Pelton Company, Inc. Pelton makes seismic vibrator control systems, vibrator positioning systems using GPS (global positioning systems), and explosive energy control systems
2002 - AXIS Geophysics, seismic data processing company specializing in anisotropic processing (AZIM), AVO (amplitude variation with offset) analysis, and azimuthal velocity modeling
2004 - Concept Systems, Ltd., command & control systems and data integration software for land and marine seismic surveys
2004 - GX Technology Corporation, seismic imaging processing and multi-client seismic data libraries, including a portfolio of BasinSPAN data libraries
2008 - ARAM Systems Ltd., a Canadian-based provider of cable-based land seismic recording systems, based in Calgary, AB
2010 - INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited, ION launched a joint venture with BGP

Activities[edit]
Since 1967, ION’s Sensor group has been providing geophones for hydrocarbon exploration.
ION’s Marine Imaging Systems. The offerings include both the towed streamer and ocean-bottom seismic markets. The products include positioning and streamer control systems, source and source control systems, and both streamer and seabed acquisition systems.
ION‘s GX Technology (GXT), provides seismic data processing services, such as depth migration, reverse time migration, and full-wave imaging; multi-client seismic data libraries, including basin-scale SPAN seismic programs; software and services for seismic survey design, geophysical analysis, and reservoir modeling; and start-to-finish seismic imaging programs that encompass survey planning, field acquisition, and final image rendering.
Through its GeoVentures business unit, ION owns one of the largest seismic data libraries in the industry. Known as BasinSPANS, these basin-wide, ultra-deep data libraries are custom designed to provide a holistic understanding of petroleum systems including source rock deposition, hydrocarbon migration paths, sediment fairways, and reservoir trapping mechanisms. ION BasinSPAN programs exist for the Gulf of Mexico, the margins of West and East Africa and for offshore basins in Colombia and the eastern Caribbean, India, Eastern and Northern Canada, and Alaska.
ION’s Concept Systems offerings include command & control systems that integrate and quality control data acquisition in towed streamer, OBC, electromagnetic (EM), and land surveys and services for designing and planning complex surveys, including wide-azimuth and 4d acquisition programs.
In March 2010, ION launched a joint venture agreement with BGP (which is a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation - CNPC) and launched INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited, an independent company owned 51% by BGP and 49% by ION Geophysical. INOVA specializes in designing, engineering, and delivering energy source and source control systems, land seismic recording systems, and digital full-wave sensors. Since the joint venture, most of ION’s land equipment and technology is applied through INOVA.
Restatements[edit]
On April 1, 2002, ION announced to restate its noncash balance sheet transaction for the sale/leaseback of its Stafford plants completed in August.The restatement had no impact on earnings.[2]
On Aug 3, 2005, ION announced to restate its financial statements for the first quarter of 2005, as a result of the Company's determination that approximately $795,000 of royalty expenses incurred by its subsidiary had been miscalculated and should have been recorded in the first quarter of 2005.[3]
On March 16, 2006, ION announced revenue recognition restatement of 2004 and quarterly 2005 results.[4]

History[edit]
Founded in 1968 as Input/Output (I/O), ION began as a provider of highly specialized, seismic source synchronization equipment. ION became publicly traded on NASDAQ in 1991, and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in November 1994 using the trading symbol "IO". Throughout the 1990s and 2000s ION experienced growth through a number of key acquisitions. In September 2007 Input/Output (I/O) officially changed its name to "ION" as part of a re-branding to better reflect the continuing evolution of the company from an equipment manufacturer to a broad-based, technology-focused seismic solutions provider.[1]
Key Acquisitions[edit]

1995 - Western Geophysical's Exploration Products Group, marine seismic recording systems, vibrator source products, and geophone products
1997 - Green Mountain Geophysics, Inc. (GMG), developer of MESA software for seismic survey design and planning
1998 - DigiCOURSE, Inc., manufacturer of marine positioning products
2001 - Pelton Company, Inc. Pelton makes seismic vibrator control systems, vibrator positioning systems using GPS (global positioning systems), and explosive energy control systems
2002 - AXIS Geophysics, seismic data processing company specializing in anisotropic processing (AZIM), AVO (amplitude variation with offset) analysis, and azimuthal velocity modeling
2004 - Concept Systems, Ltd., command & control systems and data integration software for land and marine seismic surveys

2008 - ARAM Systems Ltd., a Canadian-based provider of cable-based land seismic recording systems, based in Calgary, AB
2010 - INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited, ION launched a joint venture with BGP

Activities[edit]
Since 1967, ION’s Sensor group has been providing geophones for hydrocarbon exploration.
ION’s Marine Imaging Systems. The offerings include both the towed streamer and ocean-bottom seismic markets. The products include positioning and streamer control systems, source and source control systems, and both streamer and seabed acquisition systems.
ION‘s GX Technology (GXT), provides seismic data processing services, such as depth migration, reverse time migration, and full-wave imaging; multi-client seismic data libraries, including basin-scale SPAN seismic programs; software and services for seismic survey design, geophysical analysis, and reservoir modeling; and start-to-finish seismic imaging programs that encompass survey planning, field acquisition, and final image rendering.
Through its GeoVentures business unit, ION owns one of the largest seismic data libraries in the industry. Known as BasinSPANS, these basin-wide, ultra-deep data libraries are custom designed to provide a holistic understanding of petroleum systems including source rock deposition, hydrocarbon migration paths, sediment fairways, and reservoir trapping mechanisms. ION BasinSPAN programs exist for the Gulf of Mexico, the margins of West and East Africa and for offshore basins in Colombia and the eastern Caribbean, India, Eastern and Northern Canada, and Alaska.
ION’s Concept Systems offerings include command & control systems that integrate and quality control data acquisition in towed streamer, OBC, electromagnetic (EM), and land surveys and services for designing and planning complex surveys, including wide-azimuth and 4d acquisition programs.
In March 2010, ION launched a joint venture agreement with BGP (which is a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation - CNPC) and launched INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited, an independent company owned 51% by BGP and 49% by ION Geophysical. INOVA specializes in designing, engineering, and delivering energy source and source control systems, land seismic recording systems, and digital full-wave sensors. Since the joint venture, most of ION’s land equipment and technology is applied through INOVA.
Restatements[edit]
On April 1, 2002, ION announced to restate its noncash balance sheet transaction for the sale/leaseback of its Stafford plants completed in August.The restatement had no impact on earnings.[2]
On Aug 3, 2005, ION announced to restate its financial statements for the first quarter of 2005, as a result of the Company's determination that approximately $795,000 of royalty expenses incurred by its subsidiary had been miscalculated and should have been recorded in the first quarter of 2005.[3]
On March 16, 2006, ION announced revenue recognition restatement of 2004 and quarterly 2005 results.[4]

History[edit]
Founded in 1968 as Input/Output (I/O), ION began as a provider of highly specialized, seismic source synchronization equipment. ION became publicly traded on NASDAQ in 1991, and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in November 1994 using the trading symbol "IO". Throughout the 1990s and 2000s ION experienced growth through a number of key acquisitions. In September 2007 Input/Output (I/O) officially changed its name to "ION" as part of a re-branding to better reflect the continuing evolution of the company from an equipment manufacturer to a broad-based, technology-focused seismic solutions provider.[1]
Key Acquisitions[edit]

1994 - cable and connector groups of Tescorp, Inc., provided cables to operate I/O systems
1995 - Western Geophysical's Exploration Products Group, marine seismic recording systems, vibrator source products, and geophone products
1997 - Green Mountain Geophysics, Inc. (GMG), developer of MESA software for seismic survey design and planning
1998 - DigiCOURSE, Inc., manufacturer of marine positioning products
2001 - Pelton Company, Inc. Pelton makes seismic vibrator control systems, vibrator positioning systems using GPS (global positioning systems), and explosive energy control systems
2002 - AXIS Geophysics, seismic data processing company specializing in anisotropic processing (AZIM), AVO (amplitude variation with offset) analysis, and azimuthal velocity modeling
2004 - Concept Systems, Ltd., command & control systems and data integration software for land and marine seismic surveys
2004 - GX Technology Corporation, seismic imaging processing and multi-client seismic data libraries, including a portfolio of BasinSPAN data libraries
2008 - ARAM Systems Ltd., a Canadian-based provider of cable-based land seismic recording systems, based in Calgary, AB
2010 - INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited, ION launched a joint venture with BGP

Activities[edit]
Since 1967, ION’s Sensor group has been providing geophones for hydrocarbon exploration.
ION’s Marine Imaging Systems. The offerings include both the towed streamer and ocean-bottom seismic markets. The products include positioning and streamer control systems, source and source control systems, and both streamer and seabed acquisition systems.
ION‘s GX Technology (GXT), provides seismic data processing services, such as depth migration, reverse time migration, and full-wave imaging; multi-client seismic data libraries, including basin-scale SPAN seismic programs; software and services for seismic survey design, geophysical analysis, and reservoir modeling; and start-to-finish seismic imaging programs that encompass survey planning, field acquisition, and final image rendering.
Through its GeoVentures business unit, ION owns one of the largest seismic data libraries in the industry. Known as BasinSPANS, these basin-wide, ultra-deep data libraries are custom designed to provide a holistic understanding of petroleum systems including source rock deposition, hydrocarbon migration paths, sediment fairways, and reservoir trapping mechanisms. ION BasinSPAN programs exist for the Gulf of Mexico, the margins of West and East Africa and for offshore basins in Colombia and the eastern Caribbean, India, Eastern and Northern Canada, and Alaska.
ION’s Concept Systems offerings include command & control systems that integrate and quality control data acquisition in towed streamer, OBC, electromagnetic (EM), and land surveys and services for designing and planning complex surveys, including wide-azimuth and 4d acquisition programs.
In March 2010, ION launched a joint venture agreement with BGP (which is a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation - CNPC) and launched INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited, an independent company owned 51% by BGP and 49% by ION Geophysical. INOVA specializes in designing, engineering, and delivering energy source and source control systems, land seismic recording systems, and digital full-wave sensors. Since the joint venture, most of ION’s land equipment and technology is applied through INOVA.
Restatements[edit]
On April 1, 2002, ION announced to restate its noncash balance sheet transaction for the sale/leaseback of its Stafford plants completed in August.The restatement had no impact on earnings.[2]
On Aug 3, 2005, ION announced to restate its financial statements for the first quarter of 2005, as a result of the Company's determination that approximately $795,000 of royalty expenses incurred by its subsidiary had been miscalculated and should have been recorded in the first quarter of 2005.[3]
On March 16, 2006, ION announced revenue recognition restatement of 2004 and quarterly 2005 results.[4]

History[edit]
Founded in 1968 as Input/Output (I/O), ION began as a provider of highly specialized, seismic source synchronization equipment. ION became publicly traded on NASDAQ in 1991, and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in November 1994 using the trading symbol "IO". Throughout the 1990s and 2000s ION experienced growth through a number of key acquisitions. In September 2007 Input/Output (I/O) officially changed its name to "ION" as part of a re-branding to better reflect the continuing evolution of the company from an equipment manufacturer to a broad-based, technology-focused seismic solutions provider.[1]
Key Acquisitions[edit]

1994 - cable and connector groups of Tescorp, Inc., provided cables to operate I/O systems
1995 - Western Geophysical's Exploration Products Group, marine seismic recording systems, vibrator source products, and geophone products
1997 - Green Mountain Geophysics, Inc. (GMG), developer of MESA software for seismic survey design and planning
1998 - DigiCOURSE, Inc., manufacturer of marine positioning products
2001 - Pelton Company, Inc. Pelton makes seismic vibrator control systems, vibrator positioning systems using GPS (global positioning systems), and explosive energy control systems
2002 - AXIS Geophysics, seismic data processing company specializing in anisotropic processing (AZIM), AVO (amplitude variation with offset) analysis, and azimuthal velocity modeling
2004 - Concept Systems, Ltd., command & control systems and data integration software for land and marine seismic surveys
2004 - GX Technology Corporation, seismic imaging processing and multi-client seismic data libraries, including a portfolio of BasinSPAN data libraries
2008 - ARAM Systems Ltd., a Canadian-based provider of cable-based land seismic recording systems, based in Calgary, AB
2010 - INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited, ION launched a joint venture with BGP

Activities[edit]
Since 1967, ION’s Sensor group has been providing geophones for hydrocarbon exploration.
ION’s Marine Imaging Systems. The offerings include both the towed streamer and ocean-bottom seismic markets. The products include positioning and streamer control systems, source and source control systems, and both streamer and seabed acquisition systems.
ION‘s GX Technology (GXT), provides seismic data processing services, such as depth migration, reverse time migration, and full-wave imaging; multi-client seismic data libraries, including basin-scale SPAN seismic programs; software and services for seismic survey design, geophysical analysis, and reservoir modeling; and start-to-finish seismic imaging programs that encompass survey planning, field acquisition, and final image rendering.
Through its GeoVentures business unit, ION owns one of the largest seismic data libraries in the industry. Known as BasinSPANS, these basin-wide, ultra-deep data libraries are custom designed to provide a holistic understanding of petroleum systems including source rock deposition, hydrocarbon migration paths, sediment fairways, and reservoir trapping mechanisms. ION BasinSPAN programs exist for the Gulf of Mexico, the margins of West and East Africa and for offshore basins in Colombia and the eastern Caribbean, India, Eastern and Northern Canada, and Alaska.
ION’s Concept Systems offerings include command & control systems that integrate and quality control data acquisition in towed streamer, OBC, electromagnetic (EM), and land surveys and services for designing and planning complex surveys, including wide-azimuth and 4d acquisition programs.
In March 2010, ION launched a joint venture agreement with BGP (which is a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation - CNPC) and launched INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited, an independent company owned 51% by BGP and 49% by ION Geophysical. INOVA specializes in designing, engineering, and delivering energy source and source control systems, land seismic recording systems, and digital full-wave sensors. Since the joint venture, most of ION’s land equipment and technology is applied through INOVA.
Restatements[edit]
On April 1, 2002, ION announced to restate its noncash balance sheet transaction for the sale/leaseback of its Stafford plants completed in August.The restatement had no impact on earnings.[2]
On Aug 3, 2005, ION announced to restate its financial statements for the first quarter of 2005, as a result of the Company's determination that approximately $795,000 of royalty expenses incurred by its subsidiary had been miscalculated and should have been recorded in the first quarter of 2005.[3]
On March 16, 2006, ION announced revenue recognition restatement of 2004 and quarterly 2005 results.[4]

ION‘s GX Technology (GXT), provides seismic data processing services, such as depth migration, reverse time migration, and full-wave imaging; multi-client seismic data libraries, including basin-scale SPAN seismic programs; software and services for seismic survey design, geophysical analysis, and reservoir modeling; and start-to-finish seismic imaging programs that encompass survey planning, field acquisition, and final image rendering.
Through its GeoVentures business unit, ION owns one of the largest seismic data libraries in the industry. Known as BasinSPANS, these basin-wide, ultra-deep data libraries are custom designed to provide a holistic understanding of petroleum systems including source rock deposition, hydrocarbon migration paths, sediment fairways, and reservoir trapping mechanisms. ION BasinSPAN programs exist for the Gulf of Mexico, the margins of West and East Africa and for offshore basins in Colombia and the eastern Caribbean, India, Eastern and Northern Canada, and Alaska.
ION’s Concept Systems offerings include command & control systems that integrate and quality control data acquisition in towed streamer, OBC, electromagnetic (EM), and land surveys and services for designing and planning complex surveys, including wide-azimuth and 4d acquisition programs.
In March 2010, ION launched a joint venture agreement with BGP (which is a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation - CNPC) and launched INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited, an independent company owned 51% by BGP and 49% by ION Geophysical. INOVA specializes in designing, engineering, and delivering energy source and source control systems, land seismic recording systems, and digital full-wave sensors. Since the joint venture, most of ION’s land equipment and technology is applied through INOVA.
Restatements[edit]
On April 1, 2002, ION announced to restate its noncash balance sheet transaction for the sale/leaseback of its Stafford plants completed in August.The restatement had no impact on earnings.[2]
On Aug 3, 2005, ION announced to restate its financial statements for the first quarter of 2005, as a result of the Company's determination that approximately $795,000 of royalty expenses incurred by its subsidiary had been miscalculated and should have been recorded in the first quarter of 2005.[3]
On March 16, 2006, ION announced revenue recognition restatement of 2004 and quarterly 2005 results.[4]

Spotlight on Campeche 3D Reimaging
The Campeche reimaging programs merges over 82,000 km2 of narrow-azimuth data and ocean bottom seismic data from the CNH, to provide the high quality images necessary for prospecting in the complex salt of the Campeche basin. Using the latest ION imaging technologies, including deghosting, SRME, RTM and tomography, we are providing a timely, cost-effective solution for evaluating this highly prospective area in advance of Mexico’s upcoming bid rounds.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
