It’s simple: online communities are the most efficient tool for knowing what your customers think, predicting what they’ll do or need, and retaining them for the long-term.
And that all adds up to a better product.
When you listen to your community and respond to feedback, not only do you understand your customers more, but you can take that knowledge to improve what they already love. Whether you’re an enormous B2C company like Coca Cola or a B2B startup with a short runway, collecting user feedback quickly and efficiently is key to creating a competitive product.
Some things you learn might create a huge shift within your organization, but most pieces of intel will be small. And those small pieces of information, that help you incrementally tweak and change things within your product, will make the biggest difference -- and keep your product relevant in such a competitive world.
Natural Outcome of Community
Learning from your community is easier than you’d think. Although formal programs can create a strong feedback loop, community MVPs or surveys aren’t the only way to get useful information. Or even the best way to learn what’s working and what’s not.
Product feedback is a natural outcome of community. You’ll receive suggestions, criticisms and snippets of information from your community no matter what -- so you might as well use it to enhance user experience and make your organization stronger.
What does all this natural feedback look like? Let’s glance at just a few quick examples:

When customers help each other through problems, you get incredible insight into what they think of the product, how they approach problems and where they continually get stuck.
Sometimes when one customer asks a question, another customer suggests a product improvement that would fix the problem in the first place.
Create a space so customers can go and ask for products, features or enhancements that they need or want.

But it’s not enough to just keep an eye out for actions you can take to improve your product. It’s what you do with that information that’s equally important, and can make or break the cycle of member feedback.
Products equal conversations
Mining ideas from your community isn’t just about building a better product. It has the potential to create deeper community connections and boost engagement rates.
But that doesn’t happen if you just take ideas. You have to give back.
When you use your online community to enhance your product, the process needs to be a two-way street, a give and take. Customers give you feedback, you take it with a thank you and update the community when you’ve made the change. Rather than a top down approach, it’s a conversation, where you really learn how people use your product and what’s important to them.
This back and forth -- and properly acknowledging where you got the idea in the first place -- is what creates community. When members feel valued and heard, their contributions become about more than fixing their problems. Their engagement is about working with your organization and fellow members to make a product they already know and love even better. That’s what brings people back time and again, deepening interactions between customers and each other, and customers and your organization.
And this creates deep customer loyalty. That’s because you created an environment in which using your product is about more than just the product -- it’s about being part of a large community with one common goal. If that’s the case, why would you switch to a competitor? It’s no longer about your product. It’s about your community, who’s in the community, and the social stature each member has within it.
You and your competitor can have identical products, but your communities are as unique as a fingerprint.
When people become socially engaged and take ownership over outcomes, the product becomes more than a product.
It’s been elevated to community.

How is your association keeping its offers relevant to members and preparing for the future?
According to a recent study by Leader Networks, most associations – 83 percent – are aligning their products and services to market needs so they meet members’ expectations and stay relevant. That’s a smart goal, but it requires a deep understanding of members and prospects.

A five percent increase in customer retention can increase business profits by 25 percent. That’s substantial, but according to the Harvard Business Review, it may be on the low side. That same five percent retention increase may be able to increase revenue by up to 95 percent.

Historically, organizations have struggled to integrate community into their infrastructure and customer-facing offerings. Community is often looked at as a standalone application or service that’s tacked onto a company’s overall suite of platforms, such as their corporate website, their marketing automation platform, their email engine, and their CRM.

Mentors are a vital part of any industry. Through mentoring, employees get the chance to learn vital skills and increase competency in ways that boost morale and job satisfaction – something that’s improving with technology.
Online mentoring programs have taken the traditional brick-and-mortal experience to a new level, providing anytime, anywhere access to expertise, insights, and perspective that enhance job performance and outcomes. Associations, which are widely-recognized experts in their industries, are stepping up to offer such programs. Many times, mentoring programs even evolve into a key member benefit for professional associations.

Getting people to join your association is like making a sale. You need to offer them something they want enough that they’re willing to pay for it.
The problem is that many other organizations have similar offers and value propositions. So what benefits can you provide that convince people to join – and stay – with your association?
Here are six member benefit ideas that should do the trick.

Several years ago, ASAE’s keynote presentation was by Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can’t Stop Talking. Her talk – and her book – changed my world.
While society applauds the gregariousness of extroverts and those who can “work a room,” Susan Cain clearly explains what introverts bring to the table. What is particularly amazing is how she sees introverts thriving in social media. Because introverts can, in fact, be some of the most successful social media and online community managers, all despite their tendency to keep to themselves.

Growth can be a predicament for any team in any organization. Too early, and you’re shouldering additional cost before it’s warranted. Too late, and you risk overwhelming your employees and dropping the ball on important projects, including delivering value and engaging your audience.
That’s especially true for online communities, where results are driven by content, conversations, and programs such as e-Learning, product feedback and development, and mentoring. In the beginning, one or two people may be able to manage all these projects, but they will likely become strapped for resources as demand grows. And if your team can’t keep up with member and program needs, then your community won’t be effective at generating results.

Email can be overwhelming. Many of us let emails sit, often with good intentions of getting to them later, which results in emails not being opened or read at all.
Email communication suffers when we’re busy or our inboxes are clogged with to-dos. That’s why you need to send your marketing and member emails at the optimal time, when people are most likely to pay attention.  Catch your audience at the right time, and you’ll increase the likelihood of your members opening and engaging with your communication.

Do more with less.
That’s what associations and nonprofits are often tasked with, especially when a small staff is doing website work on top of events, benefit programs, and membership management. Putting your staff in charge of web management means they’re also tasked with attracting more new visitors to your website and convincing everyone – from new visitors to current members – to come back for more.
