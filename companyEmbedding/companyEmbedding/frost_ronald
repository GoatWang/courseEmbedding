BRICs Take a Quantum Leap in LTE Deployments
This Frost & Sullivan report will provide insight and analysis related to the development and deployment of Long Term Evolution (LTE) in BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Despite the fact that BRIC countries will be a bit slow out of the gate in terms of LTE subscriber adoption, Frost & Sullivan expects the pace to pick up in the later years of the forecast period.

  The Advent of the Phablet	

If CES is a bit of precursor of what’s to come at MWC, then we should expect even more phablet launches later in February. First, a quick definition by what the term “phablet”: it is a crossover between a smartphone and a tablet. The original definition was simple: any smartphone having a display between 4.6 “ and 5.5”. However, since screen sizes...

  Early Q2 results point to improvement in telecom industry, longer term outlook still cautious	

Juniper and Polycom were among some companies reporting their Q2 results yesterday.  The results were in both cases better than Wall Street's consensus but both companies leaned towards caution (perhaps Polycom a bit more so than Juniper, which was more optimistic in the long term).  My quick comments follow below:

In arriving at its UBB decision today, the CRTC had quite a few policy options at its disposal:

  Verizon: Another Data Point Suggesting a Slow Down in Seasonal  Spending	

The first three quarters of 2011 were strong for Verizon from a capital spend perspective, so it came as no surprise the fact that 4Q CAPEX will probably increase less sequentially than in past years, following a similar dynamic to AT&T. Typically, in years past, the Verizon 4Q CAPEX would rise in the 11-13% range, however we believe CAPEX will onl...

  Wireless Steeplechase: Verizon LTE, AT&T/Verizon CAPEX Trends	

Digesting Verizon's and AT&T's results from last week one can clearly notice a downward pattern for the second half of 2011.  AT&T guided its total CAPEX down YoY 14% for 2H11, while Verizon followed suit, down 16%.  A softer spend in the second half of the year is a bit rare, given the usual trend of back-end loaded CAPEX for AT&T and Verizon and...
