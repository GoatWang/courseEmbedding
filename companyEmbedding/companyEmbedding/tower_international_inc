History[edit]
Tower International was founded in 1993 as R.J. Tower Corporation, and later renamed Tower Automotive.[1] During the 1990s Tower Automotive grew quickly with multiple acquisitions in North America, Europe, Asia and South America. In February 2005, Tower Automotive, Inc. and its operating subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[2] In July 2007 Tower Automotive successfully emerged from Chapter 11 as an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P, which purchased the company for $1 billion.[3]
In October 2010, the company issued an initial public offering, intended to raise up to $122 million in order to pay off part of Tower's $654 million debt.[3]
Products[edit]
Tower manufactures vehicle upper-body structures, which includes large metal stampings, such as body pillars, roof rails, side members, crossmembers, floor panels and intrusion beams, as well as Class A (exterior) surfaces and assemblies, such as body panels and doors.

History[edit]
Tower International was founded in 1993 as R.J. Tower Corporation, and later renamed Tower Automotive.[1] During the 1990s Tower Automotive grew quickly with multiple acquisitions in North America, Europe, Asia and South America. In February 2005, Tower Automotive, Inc. and its operating subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[2] In July 2007 Tower Automotive successfully emerged from Chapter 11 as an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P, which purchased the company for $1 billion.[3]
In October 2010, the company issued an initial public offering, intended to raise up to $122 million in order to pay off part of Tower's $654 million debt.[3]
Products[edit]
Tower manufactures vehicle upper-body structures, which includes large metal stampings, such as body pillars, roof rails, side members, crossmembers, floor panels and intrusion beams, as well as Class A (exterior) surfaces and assemblies, such as body panels and doors.
Locations[edit]




Tower Automotive headquarters building, Livonia


Tower is headquartered in Livonia, Michigan. [3] Of its 39 facilities, it manufactures its products at 29 of them. The 29 production facilities are supported by eight engineering and sales locations.[4]
