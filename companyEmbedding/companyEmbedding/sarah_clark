Discuss the importance of security as part of the ever increasing reliance on technology in our digital world.

Structure 2017


Meet the innovators who are building infrastructure for the next decade and hear the biggest names in cloud make predictions and forecasts about our future.




Distributed computing is the new cloud computing, meaning more processing will be done closer to the actual end user to improve performance and generate real-time data. What will this look like? How will the internet of things change infrastructure needs? Is it time to re-architect the web? As governments and corporations have come to dominate the most important crossroads of the internet, are de-centralized ideas for the internet about to come back into vogue? How does the public cloud best suit your organization? Who are the next “Super 7” infrastructure buyers? If 2015 was the year of experimentation with containers, and 2016 was the year of production, will 2017 see mainstream adoption of containers for production workloads? How will the data centers of the future be managed?
