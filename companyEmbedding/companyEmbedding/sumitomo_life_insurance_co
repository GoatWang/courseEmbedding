English Home > About Us > Creation of Affluent Society




Creation of Affluent Society

We believe that contributing to society is one of our most important management priorities.

Specifically, we are advancing social contribution activities primarily focused on three priority areas: gsupport for child raising,h gsupport the next generationh and gpromotion of health (nursing care and medical care),h considering the affinity of these activities with the life insurance business.

Support for Child Raising

Child raising project to empower the future
Sumitomo Life sponsors gAwards in Support of Child Raisingh and gSumisei Woman Researcher Encouragement Prizesh backed up by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We grant the Awards in Support of Child Raising to and thereby assist distinguished activities that support child raising across the country, while introducing them as role models in an effort to spread the good practice to other areas.
The gSumisei Woman Researcher Encouragement Prizeh is a grant program intended to support both studies and child raising by woman researchers.

Sumisei After School Project

Meanwhile, we are committed to gSumisei After School Project,h another activity in support of child raising aimed
at improving the child-raising environments in all regions of Japan. Under this project, programs including onsite
schooling are offered to after school child care centers across the country, with a view to enhancing the nonhardware aspects of after school child care.



Childrenfs Drawing Contests
Since 1977, we have also organized international childrenfs drawing contests to help the healthy growth of children. In 2016, we will hold the 40th contest. Over 10.79 million works have been submitted since the start of this program. In addition, the winning works have been exhibited at the Louvre Museum in Paris every year since 2000, inspiring the dreams of children.




Support the Next Generation
YOUNG JAPAN ACTION Mao Asada~Sumitomo Life

gYOUNG JAPAN ACTION Mao Asada~Sumitomo Lifeh is a new form of project in which the figure skater Mao Asada, and Sumitomo Life collaborate in supporting social contribution activities by the youth. Ms. Asada, as the leader of this project, chooses ideas for gsocial engagement activitiesh submitted by young people across Japan, to which funds are provided, and most importantly Ms. Asada and young employees of Sumitomo Life also engage in such activities working together with the local youth. By reporting the activities through TV and radio shows, events, websites, and SNS, and by being introduced on various media, we deliver the power of the young while enlightening people on current social issues in Japan.
Promotion of Health (Nursing Care and Medical Care)

Dementia Supporters and the Pink Ribbon Campaign

In the area of promotion of health, the Company continues to implement initiatives for nursing care and medical care. Since 2009, we have been engaged in training gdementia supporters,h launched under the initiative of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. 10,285 supporters (as of March 31, 2016) have been trained so far through the training seminars we provided according to the predetermined curriculum, and this is the top tier performance among financial institutions.
We support the Pink Ribbon Campaign which educates the public on the importance of the early detection, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Our approximately 30,000 sales representatives nationwide wear pink ribbons, explain the campaign to customers, and promote breast cancer screening.

Other Initiative

Global Environment
Coral Reef Conservation Project

Coral reefs, a gift of nature to human beings and also serving an important role from the perspective of biodiversity, are being destroyed by such factors as global warming, marine pollution, development, and natural disasters.
Furthermore, we have been engaged in the Coral Reef Conservation Project since 2008, supporting the activities of NGOs in two regions in order to conserve coral reefs and promote the establishment of sustainable communities.

Sumitomo Life Insurance Company to Acquire Symetra Financial Corp. | Business Wire
























































Sumitomo Life Insurance Company to Acquire Symetra Financial Corp.





Symetra to Operate as a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Sumitomo Life 
        and Maintain Current Businesses, Employees, Management Team, Strategy, 
        Operations, Community Support and Headquarters


All-cash Transaction Offers a Meaningful Premium and Compelling 
        Value to Symetra Shareholders







August 11, 2015 07:02 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Symetra Financial Corporation (NYSE: SYA) (“Symetra”) today announced 
      that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with Sumitomo 
      Life Insurance Company (“Sumitomo Life”) pursuant to which Sumitomo Life 
      will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Symetra. Symetra 
      shareholders will receive $32.00 per share in cash at closing, plus a 
      previously announced special dividend of $0.50 per share in cash, which 
      is payable on August 28, 2015 to Symetra shareholders of record as of 
      August 10, 2015. The amount of the special dividend was established in 
      connection with the determination of the total combined transaction 
      consideration. The total combined transaction consideration of $32.50 
      per share is approximately $3.8 billion in aggregate and represents a 
      32% premium over Symetra's average stock price of $24.64 for the 30 days 
      ending August 5, 2015.
    


      Sumitomo Life, founded in 1907 and headquartered in Tokyo and Osaka, 
      Japan, is a leading life insurer in Japan with multi-channel, 
      multi-product life insurance businesses. Sumitomo Life provides 
      traditional mortality life insurance, nursing care, medical care and 
      retirement plans through sales representatives, insurance outlets, the 
      Internet and bancassurance. As of March 31, 2015, Sumitomo Life had $229 
      billion in assets, approximately 6.8 million customers and 42,000 
      employees.
    

      Symetra, founded in 1957 and based in Bellevue, Washington, provides 
      employee benefits, annuities and life insurance through a national 
      network of benefits consultants, financial institutions and independent 
      agents and advisors. As of June 30, 2015, Symetra had $34 billion in 
      assets, approximately 1.7 million customers, and 1,400 employees 
      nationwide.
    

      Symetra will become Sumitomo Life’s platform in the U.S., where Sumitomo 
      Life does not currently have a material operational presence. Symetra’s 
      President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas M. Marra, and the current 
      management team will continue to lead the business from Symetra’s 
      headquarters in Bellevue. Symetra will maintain its current brand, 
      employees, distribution channels and product mix. Symetra’s expertise in 
      and commitment to the retirement, employee benefits and life insurance 
      markets, coupled with Sumitomo Life’s resources, will create a stronger 
      and more diversified combined company with total assets of $250 billion.
    

      Masahiro Hashimoto, president and CEO of Sumitomo Life Insurance 
      Company, said, “We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to acquire 
      Symetra’s dynamic business and believe that a transaction will be 
      mutually beneficial and will create significant value for both Symetra 
      and Sumitomo Life. Both companies share a management philosophy that 
      strives to provide customers with valuable insurance solutions and offer 
      the highest quality of service. We are confident that this transaction 
      will further enhance our financial and earnings foundation by expanding 
      the size of overseas revenues, diversifying the revenue base and thereby 
      enabling us to build a well-balanced overseas business portfolio across 
      Asia and the United States.”
    

      Thomas Marra, president and CEO of Symetra, said, “We are very pleased 
      to be joining forces with Sumitomo Life, a respected industry leader 
      that has a proven track record of success and shares our deep commitment 
      to business practices that deliver strong value to customers. This 
      transaction will bring compelling strategic and financial benefits for 
      Symetra, including providing a substantial cash premium to our 
      shareholders. Our vision and long-term plans for building Symetra into a 
      national player are unchanged. We will be positioned better than ever to 
      successfully execute on these plans.”
    

      Symetra’s largest shareholders, White Mountains and Berkshire Hathaway, 
      representing approximately 18% and 17% ownership of common shares, 
      respectively, have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction.
    

      Warren E. Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO, said, “Tom and 
      his management team have done a good job running the company and have 
      executed a great deal for shareholders. I wish them the best for future 
      success under their new owners.”
    

      The transaction, which was unanimously approved by Symetra’s board of 
      directors, is expected to close late in the first quarter or early in 
      the second quarter of 2016 and is subject to the approval of Symetra’s 
      shareholders and regulators, and to other customary closing conditions.
    

      Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is acting as financial advisor and Cravath, 
      Swaine & Moore LLP is acting as legal advisor to Symetra.

The Sumitomo Life Insurance Company of Japan said on Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire Symetra Financial Corporation, an American provider of insurance and financial products, for about $3.8 billion.The deal is the latest by a Japanese insurer seeking to expand its operations into the United States, the world’s largest insurance market, as an aging Japanese population is expected to cut into results.Symetra would give Sumitomo Life its first real foothold in the United States.Under the terms of the deal, Symetra shareholders will receive $32 a share in cash, and a special dividend of 50 cents a share. The deal represents a 32 percent premium to the company’s average share price over the 30 days that ended Aug. 5.“We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to acquire Symetra’s dynamic business and believe that a transaction will be mutually beneficial and will create significant value for both Symetra and Sumitomo Life,” Masahiro Hashimoto, the president and chief executive of Sumitomo Life, said in a news release.

The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. It is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.Japanese life insurers have been seeking to acquire companies overseas, in recent years, particularly in other parts of Asia and in the United States, as they look to diversify their revenue streams outside their home country.In July, the Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Company agreed to acquire the StanCorp Financial Group for $5 billion in cash. In June, Tokio Marine Holdings announced that it would acquire HCC Insurance Holdings for $7.5 billion in cash, one of a series of deals it has undertaken in the United States since 2008.Other Japanese companies seeking growth overseas include Dai-ichi Life Insurance, which announced an agreement to buy the American company Protective Life Corporation in 2014 for about $5.7 billion.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Review of Operations
Annualized Premiums from Policies in Force

Reviewing our fiscal 2015 consolidated performance for the Sumitomo Life Group, annualized premiums from policies in force increased 18.4% from the end of the previous fiscal year to 2,583.5 billion ($22.9 billion). Meanwhile, annualized premiums from policies in force for the third-sector insurances, which we focus on as a growth area, increased 2.3% year on year to 535.4 billion ($4.7 billion), on the basis of two domestic entities (Sumitomo Life and Medicare Life) excluding Symetra, growing steadily for thirteen consecutive years since we started to publish such figures.

The two main reasons for these consecutive increases in Japan are:

We have achieved steady results through gmulti-channel, multi-producth strategy in three growing markets (nursing care, medical insurance and retirement planning), which are expanding along with the advent of a long lived society.
We have reduced the surrenders and lapses of existing policies sold through our sales representative network by maintaining thorough contact with policyholders, and efforts to improve after-sales customer service.



*Symetra closes its account on December 31 each year. Figures at the end of fiscal 2015 are the figures at the full acquisition of its ownership (February 1, 2016). US dollar figures for Symetra have been converted from the Japanese yen figures published in the Japanese-language Financial Results using the exchange rate as of the end of March 2016.
Annualized Premiums from New Business





In fiscal 2015, the Sumitomo Life Groupfs annualized premiums from new business of individual life insurance and annuities increased 23.8% from the previous fiscal year to 173.5 billion ($1.5 billion).
This increase was due predominantly to the positive effect of the launch of the new product gFuture Design 1-UP,h along with robust sales of savings-type insurances.


*Symetrafs performance will start to be recorded from fiscal 2016.



Annualized Premiums from Surrendered and Lapsed Policies





Sumitomo Lifefs annualized premiums from surrendered and lapsed policies decreased 1.5% to 86.4 billion ($0.7 billion) over the previous year.
This was mainly due to improvements with our sales representatives channel, our primary sales channel. The annualized premiums from surrendered and lapsed policies sold through our sales representatives decreased 6.3% to 65.6 billion, continuing a trend of improvement. This primarily reflects our sales representativesf effort to maintain regular contact with policyholders.



Core Business Profit






Core business profit is an indicator of the earnings strength from primary business of Japanfs life insurance companies.
In fiscal 2015, core business profit (Sumitomo Life and Medicare Life), which represents profitability excluding the impact of the standard policy reserves concerning the minimum guarantees for variable annuities, etc., decreased 11.6% from the previous fiscal year to 317.9 billion ($2.8 billion).
Meanwhile, the size of the negative spread has been constantly shrinking since fiscal 2001 when the Company started its disclosure, which turned positive for the first time in fiscal 2014 and the width of the positive spread expanded in fiscal 2015.

Corporate Governance
Governance
As a mutual insurance company, each holder of our participating policy is a member of the Company, or in other words, a part owner.
At the Annual Board of Policyholder Representatives Meeting, 180 elected policyholder representatives make decisions on important matters, including the appropriation of the Companyfs net surplus, changes to the articles of incorporation, and the appointment of directors.
As for the design of bodies involved in management including the Board of Directors, the Company transitioned to Company with Committees in July 2015, with a view to further strengthening its corporate governance framework.

  Corporate Governance Code
The Company prepares and discloses on a voluntary basis the report in accordance with gCorporate Governance Reporth as prescribed by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, from the viewpoint of enhancing information disclosure.
In addition, Corporate Governance Code is not directly applicable to the Company since it is not a listed company. However, based on the recognition that corporate governance is a common issue regardless of corporate structures, the Company responds to this issue on a voluntary basis. The Company also responds on a voluntary basis to gReasons for not implementing each principle in the Corporate Governance Codeh and gDisclosure based on each principle in the Corporate Governance Codeh in this report.


Corporate Governance Report

Compliance
We consider strictly observing law and regulations to be an important management issue in order to more firmly establish the basic business policy of living up to the trust of customers, and based on this belief, we have established a system to promote compliance.
In order to fulfill our mission of contributing to social and public welfare through the life insurance business, we faithfully conduct business in accordance with our Management Policy and the Sumitomo Life Group Code of Conduct. In addition, we have formulated the Legal Compliance Policy and Insurance Solicitation Management Policy to clarify the basic policy concerning compliance, based upon which we have developed a compliance promotion system.
Furthermore, in an aim to foster a corporate culture that values compliance, we utilize the Compliance Manual and Insurance Solicitation Compliance Manual that cover matters such as the basic approach to compliance and particularly important matters in order to ensure that they become fully aware of compliance, and have also been holding broad training programs concerning compliance.
In addition, Compliance Committee has been established with the President as the chairman to receive reports on matters such as the status of monitoring and analysis on individual issues and to conduct discussions aimed at resolving these issues. Furthermore, the Compliance Control Department that supervises compliance for the Company works to address the individual issues described above, makes reports on the state of compliance for the entire Company to bodies including the Board of Directors, and receives instructions as required for the management of operations.

Risk Management
In Japan, introduction of economic value-based solvency margin regulations is expected.
In anticipation of the future introduction, we have implemented an economic value-based integrated risk management and have become the first mutual company in Japan to disclose EEV.
Our integrated risk management system employs an advanced methodology that anticipates economic value-based solvency margin regulations, referring to the Solvency II Framework to be introduced in Europe from January 2016 and we are further upgrading our system as an effective tool that contributes to managementfs strategic decision making in the future.

Stewardship Code
The Company invests in the corporate stocks that are believed to present with medium- to long-term increase in equity values, and strives to get involved with investee companies as a shareholder through active dialogue in terms of various viewpoints, including sustainable profit growth, profit distribution to shareholders, and corporate governance, in order to promote the enhancement of medium- to long-term increase in equity values.
Accordingly, for the exercise of its voting rights, the Company makes decisions based on such dialogues from medium- to long-term viewpoints.
Meanwhile, we announced the acceptance of gthe Principles for Responsible Institutional Investors (Japanfs Stewardship Code),h as we agree to its underlying objective to promote sustainable growth as well as enhancement of corporate value of investees through dialogues.
