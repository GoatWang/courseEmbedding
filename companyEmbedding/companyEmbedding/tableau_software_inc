If I didn't start using Tableau, I would still be using Excel. I would still have a fear of data. And then I wouldn't have a bigger view of how data can help in my day-to-day work.

Before, it was always numbers in rows and columns. Now I’m eager to do a new analysis, because it's so much easier to actually see the trends, the story, and the power that the data brings.

Set up subscriptions so you get your data when you want it.









Always Innovating



Tableau's software moves as fast as you do. We invest more in R&D than anyone else in the industry—and we are guided by requests from the best user community. Enterprise features have been at the core of the Tableau platform for years, and there’s more to come. Learn what's new in Tableau.

If I didn't start using Tableau, I would still be using Excel. I would still have a fear of data. And then I wouldn't have a bigger view of how data can help in my day-to-day work.

Before, it was always numbers in rows and columns. Now I’m eager to do a new analysis, because it's so much easier to actually see the trends, the story, and the power that the data brings.

What inspired your viz?
I love trends in pop culture and wanted to do something fun for Valentine’s Day. I built this viz using Google Trends data and embedded YouTube videos. It was such a fun project. And I dare you to listen to Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” and not dance, too.
What do you like about life at Tableau?
This one’s easy: I’m surrounded by brilliant and creative people. When I can look left and right and see people who inspire and challenge me, it’s easy to see why I love coming to work every day.

Kris Rhodes
Software Engineer
What inspired your viz?
I’ve been tracking my cycling data for 7 years. I had all this data but no way to easily analyze it until Tableau. It was also a great opportunity to learn Tableau’s calculation language on a dataset I was intimately familiar with—so I would know when I got it right.
What do you like about life at Tableau?
I get to work with amazing people. I also get to meet the customers who use our software. Seeing how their lives are changed for the better because of something I worked on is one of the most fulfilling things I’ve experienced.

Product Manager
What inspired your viz?
I wanted to get my band’s demo played on our local indie radio station. I needed to figure out which DJs play bands like mine the most. The KEXP community really loved the viz, so I made some exploratory dashboards for people to ask their own questions. (By the way—it worked! Two DJs played our demo on KEXP.)
What do you like about life at Tableau?
My passions feed into my job and my job feeds into my passions. I've been privileged to tell data stories about music and write blog posts about using web data connectors to analyze my band’s Facebook fans. And it's fun to see all my Tableau friends in the crowd supporting me when my band plays a gig.

Channel Manager
What inspired your viz?
A government agency wanted to publish a whitepaper on macro trends. I grabbed three tables of open source data (two World Bank indicators and one from the Census Bureau) to show how those simple tables of numbers could tell a rich and compelling story from multiple angles.
What do you like about life at Tableau?
We are a company on a mission. I’ve seen people shed tears when they talk about the impact Tableau has on their lives. I spent 10 years in public service  and never thought I’d have this deep an impact at a software company. This is about much more than software.

Social Impact Marketing Manager
What inspired your viz?
Non-profits are always trying to “read the tea leaves”—identify corporate partners whose priorities align with their own focus. You can find data online, but drilling into specifics could take a long time. I created this easily sortable and searchable viz. It’s really useful for me, and my grant-writing friends love it!
What do you like about life at Tableau?
This is a company full of people who believe we have a product that can change the world. I love finding opportunities to prove them right.

Nivas
Developer
Why did you choose Tableau?
I wanted to work for a company that had a great talent pool like a large tech company, yet had agility of execution like a startup. Tableau had the right balance.
What are you studying and why?
I’m pursuing my MS in Computer Science. I spent a lot of time with my PC, playing games as a kid. When I grew up, I decided I wanted to make a career with computers.









Xavier
Intern
What was your favorite memory from your internship?
It’s hard to pinpoint just one. My intern group grew very close over the three months we spent together. We toured a chocolate factory, went to a Sounders game, watched fireworks at Gas Works Park, hiked mountains, had parties, escaped from an escape room, saw an improv show… and we wrote some code too.
Why did you choose Tableau?
I chose Tableau for a few reasons, one being its reputation not only as a respected company, but as a company that respects its workers.









Mia
Intern
Why did you choose Tableau?
The culture is exactly what I was looking for:  Everyone is collaborative and helpful and cares deeply about the projects they’re working on. I was immediately given meaningful tasks to help the team reach its goals. At the same time, everyone has a life outside work, too.
What are you studying and why?
I’m studying Honors Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I was first introduced to coding and computer science in my first year of high school. I fell in love with the problem-solving and analytical thinking that comes with coding.









James
Intern
Why did you choose Tableau?
I chose Tableau because of the doors they’ve opened into the world of data. Tableau has enabled thousands of users—including me—to approach data in a new way. Tableau also gave me the opportunity to work with talented people who shared similar passions for data and work on a product that I love.
What are you studying and why?
I’m studying Computer Science with a minor in Information Science. I want to understand how I would go about solving issues as a developer or a designer to create a simple yet powerful solution.









Midori
Intern
What was your favorite memory from your internship?
The people. Everyone is willing to help and support you during your internship. Some of my favorite memories came from conversations with interesting people at Tableau. Also, Bagel Friday is pretty great.
What are you studying and why?
I recently graduated from the University of Washington Foster School of Business. I studied Information Systems and Operations Supply Chain Management major because I wanted to find ways to apply principles from data analytics and project management to my interest in marketing. I also graduated with a diversity minor which allowed me to continue learning about my culture and many others during college.

Tableau Software (/tæbˈloʊ/ tab-LOH) is a software company[2] headquartered in Seattle, Washington, United States which produces interactive data visualization products[3] focused on business intelligence.[4] It initially began in order to commercialize research which had been conducted at Stanford University's Department of Computer Science between 1999 and 2002.[5] It was founded in Mountain View, California in January, 2003 by Chris Stolte, who specialized in visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes.[6] The product queries relational databases, OLAP cubes, cloud databases, and spreadsheets and then generates a number of graph types.
Tableau has a mapping functionality,[7][8] and is able to plot latitude and longitude coordinates.[9] It has been criticized for being overly US-centric.[10] They also offer custom geocoding,[11] as well as five ways to access their products: Desktop (both professional and personal editions), Server, Online (which scales to support thousands of users), Reader, and Public, with the last two free to use.[12] Vizable, a consumer data visualization mobile app, was released in 2015.[13]

Public company[edit]
On May 17, 2013, Tableau launched an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange,[14] raising more than $250 million USD.[15] Prior to its IPO, Tableau raised over $45 million in venture capital investment from investors such as NEA and Meritech.[15]
The company's 2013 revenue reached $232.44 million, an 82% growth over 2012's $128 million.[16] In 2010, Tableau reported revenue of $34.2 million. That figure grew to $62.4 million in 2011 and $127.7 million in 2012. Profit during the same periods came to $2.7 million, $3.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.[17] The founders moved the company to Seattle, Washington in October, 2003, where it remains headquartered today.[18] In August 2016, Tableau announced the appointment of Adam Selipsky as president and CEO, effective September 16, 2016, replacing co-founder Christian Chabot as CEO.[19]
Wikileaks and policy changes[edit]




Pie chart created by Tableau Software






Population pyramid created by Tableau Software


On December 2, 2010, Tableau withdrew its visualizations from the contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak by WikiLeaks, with Tableau stating that it was directly due to political pressure from US Senator Joe Lieberman.[20][21]
On February 21, 2011, Tableau posted an updated data policy.[22] The accompanying blog post cited the two main changes as (1) creating a formal complaint process and (2) using freedom of speech as a guiding principle.[23] In addition, the post announced the creation of an advisory board to help the company navigate future situations that "push the boundaries of the policy."[23] Tableau likened the new policy to the model set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and opined that under the new policy, the Wikileaks cables would not have been removed.[24]
Awards[edit]
Tableau Software has won awards including "Best Overall in Data Visualization" by DM Review, "Best of 2005 for Data Analysis" by PC Magazine,[25] and "2008 Best Business Intelligence Solution (CODiE award)" by the Software & Information Industry Association.[26]

On February 21, 2011, Tableau posted an updated data policy.[22] The accompanying blog post cited the two main changes as (1) creating a formal complaint process and (2) using freedom of speech as a guiding principle.[23] In addition, the post announced the creation of an advisory board to help the company navigate future situations that "push the boundaries of the policy."[23] Tableau likened the new policy to the model set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and opined that under the new policy, the Wikileaks cables would not have been removed.[24]
Awards[edit]
Tableau Software has won awards including "Best Overall in Data Visualization" by DM Review, "Best of 2005 for Data Analysis" by PC Magazine,[25] and "2008 Best Business Intelligence Solution (CODiE award)" by the Software & Information Industry Association.[26]

Tableau Software, Inc. Key Developments

Tableau Software Announces General Availability of Tableau 10.3
Jun 1 17
Tableau Software announced the general availability of Tableau 10.3. This release helps organizations achieve data-driven insights faster than ever, through automated table and join recommendations powered by machine learning algorithms that simplify the search for the right data for analysis. It also includes data driven alerts to allow for proactive monitoring of key metrics. 10.3 unlocks six new data sources for rapid-fire analysis, including a new connector for extracting data from PDF documents. Additionally, Tableau Online customers are able to try Tableau Bridge in beta, which enables a direct connection to data stored on premises directly in the cloud. Tableau 10.3 makes it easier for everyone to stay engaged with the metrics that matter most. With new data-driven alerts, customers can instantly receive notifications as their data crosses a pre-set threshold, ensuring they never miss an important change in their organization. Customers can set alerts simply by pointing at the data on which they want to be notified. Tableau 10.3 makes it easier for people to find the right data for their analysis with smart table and join recommendations. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, Tableau Server analyzes aggregate data source usage to recommend popular tables and corresponding joins across the organization. With recommendations, customers can save time by quickly identifying database tables that are relevant to their analysis and leveraging join recommendations to enrich their data. Now it's easy for customers to automatically apply insights from experts and other users across their organization, increasing the overall quality of their data models. Tableau 10.3 makes it easy for teams to access data, wherever it resides. In all, customers can now connect to more than 75 data sources via 66 connectors, without any programming. That includes a new PDF connector, which allows people to directly import PDF tables into Tableau with just one click. With an Adobe estimated 2.5 trillion PDFs worldwide, this unlocks a new realm of data that can be leveraged for rich analysis. Additionally, Tableau now comes with new connectors to popular data sources such as Amazon Athena, ServiceNow, MongoDB, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive. These new data connectors add to Tableau's deep roster of built-in data connectors. Tableau Online customers can now leverage data stored on premises directly in the cloud with the new Tableau Bridge. Available to all Tableau Online customers to try, this will allow a secure, live connection to on premises data, meaning it's no longer necessary to move data to perform a live query from Tableau Online. Many organizations have data on premises and in the cloud, and Tableau Bridge allows these customers to easily connect live to all of their data no matter where it is.

Tableau Software (/tæbˈloʊ/ tab-LOH) is a software company[2] headquartered in Seattle, Washington, United States which produces interactive data visualization products[3] focused on business intelligence.[4] It initially began in order to commercialize research which had been conducted at Stanford University's Department of Computer Science between 1999 and 2002.[5] It was founded in Mountain View, California in January, 2003 by Chris Stolte, who specialized in visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes.[6] The product queries relational databases, OLAP cubes, cloud databases, and spreadsheets and then generates a number of graph types.
Tableau has a mapping functionality,[7][8] and is able to plot latitude and longitude coordinates.[9] It has been criticized for being overly US-centric.[10] They also offer custom geocoding,[11] as well as five ways to access their products: Desktop (both professional and personal editions), Server, Online (which scales to support thousands of users), Reader, and Public, with the last two free to use.[12] Vizable, a consumer data visualization mobile app, was released in 2015.[13]

Public company[edit]
On May 17, 2013, Tableau launched an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange,[14] raising more than $250 million USD.[15] Prior to its IPO, Tableau raised over $45 million in venture capital investment from investors such as NEA and Meritech.[15]
The company's 2013 revenue reached $232.44 million, an 82% growth over 2012's $128 million.[16] In 2010, Tableau reported revenue of $34.2 million. That figure grew to $62.4 million in 2011 and $127.7 million in 2012. Profit during the same periods came to $2.7 million, $3.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.[17] The founders moved the company to Seattle, Washington in October, 2003, where it remains headquartered today.[18] In August 2016, Tableau announced the appointment of Adam Selipsky as president and CEO, effective September 16, 2016, replacing co-founder Christian Chabot as CEO.[19]
Wikileaks and policy changes[edit]




Pie chart created by Tableau Software






Population pyramid created by Tableau Software


On December 2, 2010, Tableau withdrew its visualizations from the contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak by WikiLeaks, with Tableau stating that it was directly due to political pressure from US Senator Joe Lieberman.[20][21]
On February 21, 2011, Tableau posted an updated data policy.[22] The accompanying blog post cited the two main changes as (1) creating a formal complaint process and (2) using freedom of speech as a guiding principle.[23] In addition, the post announced the creation of an advisory board to help the company navigate future situations that "push the boundaries of the policy."[23] Tableau likened the new policy to the model set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and opined that under the new policy, the Wikileaks cables would not have been removed.[24]
Awards[edit]
Tableau Software has won awards including "Best Overall in Data Visualization" by DM Review, "Best of 2005 for Data Analysis" by PC Magazine,[25] and "2008 Best Business Intelligence Solution (CODiE award)" by the Software & Information Industry Association.[26]

Tableau Software (/tæbˈloʊ/ tab-LOH) is a software company[2] headquartered in Seattle, Washington, United States which produces interactive data visualization products[3] focused on business intelligence.[4] It initially began in order to commercialize research which had been conducted at Stanford University's Department of Computer Science between 1999 and 2002.[5] It was founded in Mountain View, California in January, 2003 by Chris Stolte, who specialized in visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes.[6] The product queries relational databases, OLAP cubes, cloud databases, and spreadsheets and then generates a number of graph types.
Tableau has a mapping functionality,[7][8] and is able to plot latitude and longitude coordinates.[9] It has been criticized for being overly US-centric.[10] They also offer custom geocoding,[11] as well as five ways to access their products: Desktop (both professional and personal editions), Server, Online (which scales to support thousands of users), Reader, and Public, with the last two free to use.[12] Vizable, a consumer data visualization mobile app, was released in 2015.[13]

Public company[edit]
On May 17, 2013, Tableau launched an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange,[14] raising more than $250 million USD.[15] Prior to its IPO, Tableau raised over $45 million in venture capital investment from investors such as NEA and Meritech.[15]
The company's 2013 revenue reached $232.44 million, an 82% growth over 2012's $128 million.[16] In 2010, Tableau reported revenue of $34.2 million. That figure grew to $62.4 million in 2011 and $127.7 million in 2012. Profit during the same periods came to $2.7 million, $3.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.[17] The founders moved the company to Seattle, Washington in October, 2003, where it remains headquartered today.[18] In August 2016, Tableau announced the appointment of Adam Selipsky as president and CEO, effective September 16, 2016, replacing co-founder Christian Chabot as CEO.[19]
Wikileaks and policy changes[edit]




Pie chart created by Tableau Software






Population pyramid created by Tableau Software


On December 2, 2010, Tableau withdrew its visualizations from the contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak by WikiLeaks, with Tableau stating that it was directly due to political pressure from US Senator Joe Lieberman.[20][21]
On February 21, 2011, Tableau posted an updated data policy.[22] The accompanying blog post cited the two main changes as (1) creating a formal complaint process and (2) using freedom of speech as a guiding principle.[23] In addition, the post announced the creation of an advisory board to help the company navigate future situations that "push the boundaries of the policy."[23] Tableau likened the new policy to the model set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and opined that under the new policy, the Wikileaks cables would not have been removed.[24]
Awards[edit]
Tableau Software has won awards including "Best Overall in Data Visualization" by DM Review, "Best of 2005 for Data Analysis" by PC Magazine,[25] and "2008 Best Business Intelligence Solution (CODiE award)" by the Software & Information Industry Association.[26]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
