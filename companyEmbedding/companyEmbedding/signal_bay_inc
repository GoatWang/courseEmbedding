Clean Cannabis Please: Signal Bay, Inc. Looks to Dominate Marijuana Testing
        																																						
              











 News provided by
Signal Bay, Inc.

The Company's EVIO Labs are setting the standard in the growing cannabis testing market 
BEND, OR, Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Whether you're looking to ease the symptoms of cancer or just looking to unwind on a Friday evening, marijuana is the substance of choice for many Americans. The social stigma of pot continues to dwindle (there will always be some squares), and as a consequence more and more states have sought to legalize the use of cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes.








In fact, medical marijuana has become legal in 25 states, while recreational marijuana use has been decriminalized throughout the nation. Four states: Colorado, Alaska, Washington, and Oregon have (to varying degrees) legalized marijuana use for recreational purposes. Also, more states have recreational legal marijuana on the ballot, including the most populous state, California.
With legalization comes regulation, and with regulation comes the mandate for quality control standards—just like any other legal substance. And there is a lot that must be tested such as levels of potency, pesticides, E.coli, yeast, mold, and other contaminants etc. In 2015, Governor of California, Jerry Brown, signed the Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act which will give the state some of the most comprehensive regulations in the nation.  With only 5% of California cannabis currently being tested, these regulatory measures (and similar ones nationwide) provide a tremendous market opportunity for companies able to nimbly operate in the growing cannabis testing market: Enter Signal Bay, Inc.  
Goodbye Oregano, Hello EVIO 
Signal Bay, Inc. is the Oregon-based Life Science company operates through its three subsidiaries: EVIO Labs, Signal Bay Research, and Signal Bay Services. Going public via reverse merger in 2014, Signal Bay focused primarily on providing research and consulting services to cannabis growers, product manufacturers, and other industry professionals. 
"We provide data collection and industry research as well as help entrepreneurs in the cannabis space get licenses and put them in touch with capital opportunities," explained CEO of Signal Bay, William Waldrop. "To date, our consulting and research expertise has been responsible for the generation of over $80 million in deal flow." 
But while some Signal Bay personnel were satisfied with this impressive consulting and research business, CEO William Waldrop and other top management saw a much larger opportunity in the cannabis testing market, a market that is expected to grow to over $520 million by 2020.  Leveraging their expertise in the industry and client relationships, the Company to redirected its focus on its EVIO Labs division. With three cannabis testing currently operating in Oregon, the Company now controls 95% of the legal cannabis testing space in the state. Next stop for Signal Bay is the new "Green Rush" state California, where Signal Bay has signed a Letter of Intent to acquire another testing laboratory. 
"This key move in California will provide us a solid foundation in what is virtually a wide open market," added Waldrop. 
By the end of 2016, Signal Bay is expected to have 5 of its EVIO Labs operating in total, helping more than double the Company's 2015 revenues of a little under $600,000 to over $1.4 million. By 2020, Mr. Waldrop expects the Company to be doing over $45 million in annual revenues operating 30 EVIO Labs. 
But is this kind of growth possible for such a young company? Mr. Waldrop believes it is. The key, he asserts, is Signal Bay's business model, a model that sets it apart from the competition. A model that best achieves economies of scale. 
It's the Economies of Scale, Stupid…
There are only a handful of companies trying to capture the growing cannabis compliance testing market. However, these companies are mostly in the business of owning and operating independent labs, each of which provides core testing services. In simpler terms, each lab is its own centralized entity, operating as basically its own business. But the limber management team at Signal Bay, a team that has redirected focus in the past in light of new opportunities, has developed a business model they liken to Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:  DGX) an industry leader in clinical laboratory services.
"It's the hub and spoke model," simplifies Waldrop. "In each state we have one centralized testing laboratory with other ancillary testing facilities in local markets statewide. The core centralized lab handles the bigger, high dollar testing functions while the smaller localized labs handle collection, sampling, and other testing services. This enables us to develop networks of testing laboratories that operate efficiently within each state." 
The 'Profit' Of Weed Testing 
Signal Bay isn't in the business of building laboratories or acquiring an empty lab and setting up shop. Rather, the Company acquires currently operating cannabis testing laboratories, along with the existing client base. Once acquired, Signal Bay ensures that the laboratory is operating up to its reputable EVIO Labs standard. With years of industry consulting and research expertise, Signal Bay looks to increase the lab's efficiency and expand its client base, as well as work with existing personnel to educate them on how to improve quality control. 
"With our three operating labs in Oregon, we currently have a client base of over 700 customers," continued Waldrop. "With our California acquisition, we will be acquiring around 300 clients alone." 
A crude comparison might be to think of Signal Bay as the cannabis testing version of the CNBC show, "The Profit." Like the way business expert Marcus Lemonis revamps some small family business, Signal Bay acquires a cannabis testing laboratory and revamps it to guarantee quality and efficiency. The Company is essentially in the quality control business, a business that, with more and more regulations mandated by states legalizing marijuana, will continue to grow exponentially. 
The real key to the cannabis testing business, however, is understanding the local market in which each lab operates.
"The most important thing people need to understand about the cannabis business is that it is very much a relationship-based industry," said Waldrop. "It's all about close client relationships, and understanding the market on a local level." 
Test Locally, Grow Globally
Signal Bay is a young company, but one that might just be poised for significant growth. With a big footprint in Oregon with eyes on California and Maryland, the Company's EVIO Labs might become the standard in the growing cannabis compliance testing industry. If the young Company can continue to grow smartly without becoming overextended—and continue to grow its EVIO brand—it might just leave its cannabis competitors up in smoke.

SANTA MONICA,  CA / ACCESSWIRE / July 28, 2017 / A  month after saying it was expanding its cannabis testing business into  Massachusetts, Signal Bay Inc. (OTCQB: SGBY) made good on their promise, inking  a definitive  agreement to acquire Viridis Analytics MA, LLC for an undisclosed  amount.  Viridis is one of only a handful  of operating cannabis testing laboratories in the state, serving clients from a  state-of-the-art facility at its headquarters in Southborough, Massachusetts.
Through its subsidiary, EVIO Labs, Signal Bay initiated its  cannabis testing market footprint in its home state of Oregon, opening its  first licensed facility in October 2016.   Led by CEO William Waldrop, the company is making short work of  expansion into other large U.S. markets where cannabis has been legalized for  both recreational and medicinal purposes.   The company, which recently said it plans to change its name to EVIO,  Inc. as a better branding method, has, in the last month, penetrated the  massive California market and now Massachusetts, as well.
In November, residents in both states voted to legalize  recreational marijuana, setting the stage for a surge in cannabis demand in 2018.  Against the backdrop of increased consumption,  lawmakers are challenged to enact regulations to ensure the safety of marijuana  products.  Market analysts at New  Frontier forecast the California and Massachusetts cannabis markets will reach $6.46  billion and $1.1  billion, respectively, by 2020.
As these markets swell, so will the demand for accredited  testing facilities to help standardize and verify repeatable strains and make  sure all products are free of pesticides, pathogens and other potentially  harmful contaminants.
By their own accord, EVIO Labs estimates that the cannabis  testing market in Massachusetts, alone, will top $30 million by 2020.  When the acquisition of Viridis is completed  next week, EVIO Labs will be one of only three operating testing facilities in  the state.
"With marijuana being legal in one fashion or another across  29 states, opportunities abound outside of Oregon, but we are being meticulous  about where we are spending our resources to maximize return and build  shareholder value," Waldrop said in a phone conversation on Thursday.  "Our move into Costa Mesa, California gives  us a leg up on labs potentially opening in other Orange County cities.  Now, we have a more than ample opportunity to  capture market share as one of the few operating labs in the whole state of  Massachusetts."
"We have cutting edge testing equipment, the expertise,  gravitas and a head start on competition in what are expected to be massive  markets," he added.  "As we cement our  positions in these markets, our strategy is to identify optimal organic and  inorganic growth opportunities to cascade our labs across the country."
Massachusetts is expected to experience a tremendous boom in  dispensaries going forward.  Consider  that, while much more populous, California has approximately 2,800 dispensaries  compared to Massachusetts, which only has 11.   That equates to 1 dispensary in CA for about every 14,000 people, versus  1 dispensary for every 618,000 people in MA.
Simply, 11 dispensaries are not going to service the 6.8  million citizens of Massachusetts.  According  to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, there are  over 100 pending applications for registered marijuana dispensaries that can open  upon final approval.
EVIO Labs will be in on the ground floor as the number of MA  dispensaries rises 10-fold, just the way that they are aligned to be the first accredited  lab in Orange County, CA, providing evidence that Waldrop and his team have got  a game plan and are executing it to the letter.  
That doesn't mean they're content where they are, though. 
"Yes, we're happy with what we've accomplished in a short  period of time for sure, but in this rapidly emerging industry there's no time  to reflect upon those successes; we are already moving forward with expansion  into additional states."

Signal Bay, Inc. Parent Company of EVIO Labs provides Corporate Update
Bend, OR 07/20/2017 Signal Bay Inc. (OTCQB:SGBY) a market leader in cannabis testing, research, and advisory services is pleased to provide our shareholders a corporate update.
Coast to Coast is our new mantra, stated Signal Bay CEO William Waldrop, We plan to have EVIO Labs represented in every market that requires independent laboratory testing across North America. We have made significant strides in this endeavor, acquiring, accrediting and streamlining four labs in Oregon pre-legalization and our location in Yuba City, CA. Now those same labs are recording significant growth on a year-over-year basis. We are now aggressively approaching California with the same vigor, seeking to identify local markets and building client relationships that will maximize shareholder value. We feel our recent decision to locate in Costa Mesa, California will be pinnacle to helping us achieve this goal. We are in final phases of discussions with prospective growth opportunities that will expand the EVIO Labs brand into the North East, South East and even the Central United States.
Speaking of brand recognition, the Board of Directors has realized that from our inception as a consulting and industry research company under the brand of Signal Bay, and the tremendous growth of our EVIO Labs division, there is a need for uniform national branding and awareness efforts. As such, the Board of Directors has approved a shareholder vote to rename the company EVIO, INC. Along with this renaming, if approved we would request FINRA to change our stock symbol to reflect our new identity.
The company continues to refine and improve its business model, complete the implementation of new equipment, and strive to maximize efficiencies from our recent acquisitions. But as previously noted, to support the accelerated growth for a company at this stage cannot be accomplished solely by relying on internal cash flow. As such Signal Bay has been able to secure a $3M mezzanine financing commitment from two institutional investors. These debenture financing agreements have been structured to provide Signal Bay the capital it needs to expand into these markets while minimizing shareholder impact.
CEO Will Waldrop continues "Our continued meetings with institutional investors, at events such as L.D. Micro, continues to drive strong interest based on our tremendous growth and continued success. The one area of heartburn is that we continue to get negative feedback regarding our current share structure. It severely limits the types of institutional investors we can attract and as such impacts our ability to raise traditional equity financing. It is time to address the elephant in the room and clean up our share structure. As such, the Signal Bay Board of Directors has approved a shareholder vote to perform a reverse stock split of the companys common stock. As discussed back in March, the holders of both the Series B and Series C preferred stock removed all anti-reserve provisions, so they will reverse along with the common stock on a pro-rata basis. Our goal is that when this is complete, we will only have one series of common stock. This coupled with our new acquisition financing will have a positive impact on all shareholders. We feel that this is imperative to protect the value created thus far through our achievements and prepare the company to be positioned for growth and future up-listings.

SANTA MONICA,  CA / ACCESSWIRE / July 28, 2017 / A  month after saying it was expanding its cannabis testing business into  Massachusetts, Signal Bay Inc. (OTCQB: SGBY) made good on their promise, inking  a definitive  agreement to acquire Viridis Analytics MA, LLC for an undisclosed  amount.  Viridis is one of only a handful  of operating cannabis testing laboratories in the state, serving clients from a  state-of-the-art facility at its headquarters in Southborough, Massachusetts.
Through its subsidiary, EVIO Labs, Signal Bay initiated its  cannabis testing market footprint in its home state of Oregon, opening its  first licensed facility in October 2016.   Led by CEO William Waldrop, the company is making short work of  expansion into other large U.S. markets where cannabis has been legalized for  both recreational and medicinal purposes.   The company, which recently said it plans to change its name to EVIO,  Inc. as a better branding method, has, in the last month, penetrated the  massive California market and now Massachusetts, as well.
In November, residents in both states voted to legalize  recreational marijuana, setting the stage for a surge in cannabis demand in 2018.  Against the backdrop of increased consumption,  lawmakers are challenged to enact regulations to ensure the safety of marijuana  products.  Market analysts at New  Frontier forecast the California and Massachusetts cannabis markets will reach $6.46  billion and $1.1  billion, respectively, by 2020.
As these markets swell, so will the demand for accredited  testing facilities to help standardize and verify repeatable strains and make  sure all products are free of pesticides, pathogens and other potentially  harmful contaminants.
By their own accord, EVIO Labs estimates that the cannabis  testing market in Massachusetts, alone, will top $30 million by 2020.  When the acquisition of Viridis is completed  next week, EVIO Labs will be one of only three operating testing facilities in  the state.
"With marijuana being legal in one fashion or another across  29 states, opportunities abound outside of Oregon, but we are being meticulous  about where we are spending our resources to maximize return and build  shareholder value," Waldrop said in a phone conversation on Thursday.  "Our move into Costa Mesa, California gives  us a leg up on labs potentially opening in other Orange County cities.  Now, we have a more than ample opportunity to  capture market share as one of the few operating labs in the whole state of  Massachusetts."
"We have cutting edge testing equipment, the expertise,  gravitas and a head start on competition in what are expected to be massive  markets," he added.  "As we cement our  positions in these markets, our strategy is to identify optimal organic and  inorganic growth opportunities to cascade our labs across the country."
Massachusetts is expected to experience a tremendous boom in  dispensaries going forward.  Consider  that, while much more populous, California has approximately 2,800 dispensaries  compared to Massachusetts, which only has 11.   That equates to 1 dispensary in CA for about every 14,000 people, versus  1 dispensary for every 618,000 people in MA.
Simply, 11 dispensaries are not going to service the 6.8  million citizens of Massachusetts.  According  to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, there are  over 100 pending applications for registered marijuana dispensaries that can open  upon final approval.
EVIO Labs will be in on the ground floor as the number of MA  dispensaries rises 10-fold, just the way that they are aligned to be the first accredited  lab in Orange County, CA, providing evidence that Waldrop and his team have got  a game plan and are executing it to the letter.  
That doesn't mean they're content where they are, though. 
"Yes, we're happy with what we've accomplished in a short  period of time for sure, but in this rapidly emerging industry there's no time  to reflect upon those successes; we are already moving forward with expansion  into additional states."

Signal Bay, Inc. Provides Review of 2016 and Corporate Update
 Bend, OR  (FSCwire) - Signal Bay Inc. (OTCQB:SGBY) the market leader in cannabis testing, laboratory, operations, and research services is pleased to provide our shareholders a corporate update.
 
2016 was a seminal year for Signal Bay, demonstrating our commitment to being the clear leader in delivering product safety and certainty to the legal cannabis industry. We completed the acquisition of four operating cannabis testing labs, three in Oregon and one in California that expanded our operational footprint into the largest cannabis marketplace in the world.
 
The Oregon acquisitions solidified the company’s position as the defining leader of analytical testing services in Oregon as new OLCC rules requiring the comprehensive testing of all cannabis products sold in the state rolled out on October 1st. At the same time the implementation of our Spoke & Hub model of maximizing internal efficiencies allowed us to provide our clients the most accurate tests in a timely fashion. Our consulting division continued to expand in 2016 as we assisted several new consulting clients with licensure and startup of new marijuana establishments.
 
In April, the Company rebranded its Lab Testing division as EVIO Labs to differentiate its Consulting and Research divisions from the Analytical Lab division.
 
In May 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Oregon Analytical Services, an operating cannabis testing laboratory located in Eugene, Oregon. In June, the Company completed the acquisition of a majority ownership of Kenevir Research Inc. an operating analytical and research laboratory located in Medford Oregon positioned in the heart of Oregon’s thriving outdoor cultivation region. In October, the Company completed the acquisition of GreenHaus Analytical Labs, an operating analytical laboratory located in Portland, Oregon.
 
At the end of 2016 the company was in the enviable position of operating 4 analytical testing labs strategically positioned throughout Oregon to provide timely lab services to over 1000 clients operating throughout the state.  
 
In November, the Company completed its flurry of 2016 acquisitions with the purchase of Green Style Analytics Lab in Yuba City, California. Located 30 miles north of Sacramento and operating a mobile lab delivery program for the previous five years throughout the region from Bay Area to Humboldt to Redwood City and beyond.  This acquisition positions the company to springboard its entry into the California marketplace with the rollout of strict state mandated independent testing requirements for retail cannabis commencing in January of 2018.
 
This year saw continued growth for Signal Bay’s consulting services. We have signed a number of consulting clients in Pennsylvania, California and Oregon to assist with both local and state licensing application services, ultimately submitting numerous marijuana establishment license applications on behalf of clients. The company’s Maryland consulting clients realized tremendous success with the results of the states highly competitive application process announced in December. We anticipate continuing to work with marijuana establishment applicants in 2017 in jurisdictions throughout the country.
 
CEO Will Waldrop stated that "Signal Bay achieved many of its milestones of growth and efficiencies last year and is working smart to enhance shareholder value in 2017. The rollout of Oregon’s comprehensive testing protocols on October 1st of this year, along with the numerous state changes, went a long way in allowing us to refine and perfect our Hub & Spoke model that allows us to take on an unprecedented number of clients and to deliver accurate and most importantly to our clients; timely testing services demonstrated by the internal metrics of seeing turnaround time on client samples improving every month.  We are also working to implement a corporate wide Laboratory Information Management System Software (LIMS) to improve customer satisfaction by reducing turn-around times and improve internal operational efficiencies. 
 
Mr. Waldrop continued “The strongest feedback to validate our business model by a wide margin comes directly from consumers across the country and around the world who are consistently demanding that the cannabis products they purchase for recreational and/or especially for medical uses; whether in flower, edible, oil or concentrate form; be certified free of contaminants and provide accurate potency information, you could attribute this level of consumer awareness to what can be described as  the “Whole Foods” effect, where informed consumers demand to know that the products they are purchasing are safe.
 
Mr. Waldrop concluded by stating that, “We are continuing to evaluate additional growth opportunities, leveraging our Hub & Spoke analytical laboratory testing model to strategically position Signal Bay to be the leader of cannabis compliance and analytical testing services to support our mission of providing consumer and product safety anywhere legal cannabis is available.”

Signal Bay, Inc. Parent Company of EVIO Labs provides Corporate Update
Bend, OR 07/20/2017 Signal Bay Inc. (OTCQB:SGBY) a market leader in cannabis testing, research, and advisory services is pleased to provide our shareholders a corporate update.
Coast to Coast is our new mantra, stated Signal Bay CEO William Waldrop, We plan to have EVIO Labs represented in every market that requires independent laboratory testing across North America. We have made significant strides in this endeavor, acquiring, accrediting and streamlining four labs in Oregon pre-legalization and our location in Yuba City, CA. Now those same labs are recording significant growth on a year-over-year basis. We are now aggressively approaching California with the same vigor, seeking to identify local markets and building client relationships that will maximize shareholder value. We feel our recent decision to locate in Costa Mesa, California will be pinnacle to helping us achieve this goal. We are in final phases of discussions with prospective growth opportunities that will expand the EVIO Labs brand into the North East, South East and even the Central United States.
Speaking of brand recognition, the Board of Directors has realized that from our inception as a consulting and industry research company under the brand of Signal Bay, and the tremendous growth of our EVIO Labs division, there is a need for uniform national branding and awareness efforts. As such, the Board of Directors has approved a shareholder vote to rename the company EVIO, INC. Along with this renaming, if approved we would request FINRA to change our stock symbol to reflect our new identity.
The company continues to refine and improve its business model, complete the implementation of new equipment, and strive to maximize efficiencies from our recent acquisitions. But as previously noted, to support the accelerated growth for a company at this stage cannot be accomplished solely by relying on internal cash flow. As such Signal Bay has been able to secure a $3M mezzanine financing commitment from two institutional investors. These debenture financing agreements have been structured to provide Signal Bay the capital it needs to expand into these markets while minimizing shareholder impact.
CEO Will Waldrop continues "Our continued meetings with institutional investors, at events such as L.D. Micro, continues to drive strong interest based on our tremendous growth and continued success. The one area of heartburn is that we continue to get negative feedback regarding our current share structure. It severely limits the types of institutional investors we can attract and as such impacts our ability to raise traditional equity financing. It is time to address the elephant in the room and clean up our share structure. As such, the Signal Bay Board of Directors has approved a shareholder vote to perform a reverse stock split of the companys common stock. As discussed back in March, the holders of both the Series B and Series C preferred stock removed all anti-reserve provisions, so they will reverse along with the common stock on a pro-rata basis. Our goal is that when this is complete, we will only have one series of common stock. This coupled with our new acquisition financing will have a positive impact on all shareholders. We feel that this is imperative to protect the value created thus far through our achievements and prepare the company to be positioned for growth and future up-listings.
