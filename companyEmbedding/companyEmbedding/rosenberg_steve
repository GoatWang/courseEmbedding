With detailed instructions and videos explaining how to perform a number of common maintenance and renovation tasks around a house, an untrained homeowner might be surprised at how much he or she can accomplish with a quick search online. But even with all of this information, there are still many jobs that lie far outside the scope of most DIY enthusiasts. General contractors are there to fill in this gap.A general contractor specializes in seeing a home remodel or repair project through from start to finish. To do this, the contractor works with the client - whether they are a homeowner or business - to nail down the scope of the work. Then he or she will turn to one or more subcontractors for specific tasks, like equipment operation, design, electrical work or whatever else is needed.In essence, general contractors could be thought of as middlemen between a homeowner or business owner and any number of specialists. To get their money's worth, many assume they should just "cut out the middleman" and hire specialists directly, but this often proves more difficult in practice. General contractors won't be completing an entire project by themselves, but should have a long list of dependable experts who can work together and accomplish any task. They might also serve as the manager on the site of a construction project, overseeing workers and providing guidance and assistance when needed. For larger projects, though, the contractor might only handle administrative matters and employ a foreman or other professional for on-site supervision.Common JobsThere are many general contractors who also specialize in certain tasks themselves. There is usually at least one general contractor on hand to organize the construction of an entire home, for example. But general contractors could also help a homeowner add an additional bedroom, build an in-ground pool or complete a major landscaping project. They could also work with a business to add or improve office space, whether that means making more room or converting a commercial building from a nail salon to a restaurant. Basically, if it's a job that involves building or repairing, a general contractor probably knows how to get it done.No matter what the exact job may be, a contractor will probably need to accomplish several other essential tasks in pursuit of the ultimate goal, which may include:Understanding and applying for building permits to meet local regulationsOrganizing a budget and adhering to it throughout the projectGathering all the necessary tools and equipment, from hammers and shovels to large excavators and generatorsSecuring the construction site and equipment after work hoursWorking with personnel on-site to address any issuesKeeping records of materials, labor and all other expensesLicensingEvery general contractor performing any kind of work on a project must be licensed to do so in their state. The guidelines for the specifics on licensing vary from state to state. Some states might only require registration of contractors, which is different from licensing. Registration typically means that there must be a written record of what work is being performed and by whom, but it does not guarantee professional knowledge. Licensing, on the other hand, involves an examination process to assess professional competence.Whether your state requires licensing or registration of contractors, there should be a record of most professionals willing to complete certain projects in your area. Check your state or county website for more information. In states that require licensing, every licensed contractor's contact information is available online or from another public source.Not every project needs to be completed by a licensed or registered contractor. If it's just a minor job that won't take more than a day or two, and will cost less than a few hundred dollars, it's likely not necessary to find a licensed or registered contractor. However, anything bigger or more expensive, or a project involving plumbing or electrical work, needs to be completed by a licensed or registered professional.General contractors also must be covered by an insurance policy. This should include liability coverage for any property damage that could be inflicted in the course of a job. It should also include a worker's compensation policy in case anyone is injured on the job. Before hiring a contractor for anything, ask for written proof of this insurance to see exactly what is covered. Trade AssociationsA number of trade associations for contractors in the U.S. exist. Some of the biggest include:Associated General Contractors of America: Represents more than 6,500 general contracting firms and more than 9,000 specialty contractors nationwide.Associated Builders and Contractors: Represents non-union contracting firms.Most trade associations for general contractors will provide references for anyone looking to hire a contractor for a specific project. They may also provide a number of benefits for their members, including assistance with licensing, training, insurance and business development.Hiring a General ContractorNo matter what you need accomplished, you want to choose a contractor who can get the job done right at a reasonable price. Obviously, this is easier said than done, but there are a few steps you can take to ensure you find a trustworthy general contractor.Finding general contractorsThe first, and perhaps most reliable, way to find a general contractor is to ask friends and family members for a recommendation. If you know anyone who has had major work done on their home, particularly if it's a similar job, ask them who they hired and if they were pleased with the result. You could also ask neighbors about who they've hired if you notice work being done on their house. Many remodeling contractors post signs in front of homes to advertise their services. As a general rule, it's rarely a good idea to hire a contractor who solicits work by going door to door.If you are considering hiring a contractor without a personal recommendation, ask the contractor for references from past clients, and do as much background research on them as possible. Look for any complaints (or compliments) online to get a better idea of their track record. There are a number of websites specializing in connecting contractors with people or businesses who need work done. These sites may also allow past clients to submit their own reviews of the contractor. BudgetBefore hiring a contractor, make sure you are both in agreement on the project's budget. It's normal for most contractors to charge clients a premium not only for the labor expenses and zoning expertise, but for acquiring the materials as well. Be as clear and concise as possible regarding what you'll be purchasing yourself and what you will be paying the contractor to complete. Homeowners may be able to find a better deal on raw materials when they purchase these directly, but they first need to be sure they aren't buying the wrong things.Don't forget to discuss how the project will be finalized and what will be done about cleanup. Plans for how the work site will be cleaned at the end of each day as well as at the conclusion of work need to be put in writing. An experienced general contractor should make every effort to keep the workspace clean and prevent dirtying or damaging any other area. Even so, talk with the contractor about the daily schedule, the logistics of transporting workers and equipment, and how cleanup will be handled.Prioritizing SafetyAs previously mentioned, you need to make sure to follow any state and local regulations regarding construction work, which includes hiring a licensed or registered general contractor. Ask the contractor for proof of their certification before signing anything, as well as their proof of insurance. You should also check your homeowners insurance policy to see if they offer coverage for contracted work. You may want to call your insurance provider and ask for more details on what your plan will and won't cover.Perhaps the best way to feel safe about a contractor and the work being done is to hire a contractor you trust. This is why relying on personal references from friends and family is so important, and will often provide a great deal of peace of mind. If you aren't able to obtain a reference, work to conduct extensive research on the contractor as well as the work you are hiring them to perform. This should bring everyone's expectations into alignment and result in a safe work environment.Financial safetyBefore any money changes hands, there should be a contract to sign. Make sure the specifics of the work to be done and all costs are listed in the contract, right down to the most precise details. If you forget to have something included in the contract after signing it, there's rarely a chance of recourse. Once the specifics of the job are nailed down, be sure to discuss the payment schedule with the contractor. This is important because paying too much up front offers the homeowner minimal leverage if the quality of work does not meet expectations or contractual specifications. Try to establish a reasonable pay schedule with the contractor, such as paying 10 percent of the total cost for each 10 percent of the work that is completed. It's a good idea to include this payment plan in the contract as well.Finally, look into getting a lien release signed before work begins. If there is ever a dispute regarding payment over the course of the project, a contractor or subcontractor could place a payment claim, or lien, on your property. This can trigger a long legal process that may be frustrating. To avoid this, ask the contractor to sign a lien release, which is a legal agreement that states that any payment accepted is final. This can come in handy if a contractor has his or her own payment issues with their subcontractors. Signing a lien release form certifies that any payment made by a client to the contractor is enough to pay for any goods or services rendered. A lien dispute could also be prevented by performing due diligence prior to picking a contractor, as any contractor with good credit and a long track record of satisfied clients should have no trouble paying for materials and labor once all contract conditions have been met.Once work is underway, it's never a bad idea to check up on the progress of the job, either by staying in touch with the contractor over the phone or visiting the site in person. If you work with a trustworthy professional, it's probably best to keep your distance and allow everyone to stay busy. If you want to keep an eye on things, make sure workers wear the right safety gear and that everything looks to be moving along according to schedule. Finally, once work is finished and you are satisfied, be sure to thank your contractor and tell friends or family members about your experience.

Steven Rosenberg and T-Cell Immunotherapy for Cancer8 Apr, 2014  in  Cancer  /  Immunology  /  Next Gen Sequencing   by Dale Yuzuki  

Steven Rosenberg, NCI at a 2014 AACR Plenary Session
As a person who worked at a melanoma research institute once upon a time (the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica California, by the way), it was a pleasure to hear Steven Rosenberg’s plenary talk at the AACR meeting in San Diego. A lot has happened since 1997.
It was in the mid-1990’s that I was working in the laboratory of Dr. David Hoon, and the Institute was one of the few groups at that time that had several groups working on tumor immunology. One of our main ‘competitors’ in the tumor immunology field (for metastatic melanoma) was Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, which had the history of being the longest NCI Research Program Project grantees at that time (JWCI had the second-longest one).
Dr. Rosenberg is the Chief of Surgery at the NCI, and has been working on cell transfer immunotherapy for many years. His work is built on the insight from his work (going back to the mid-1980’s) on the function of IL-2 to expand an individual’s specific T-cell population for cell-mediated lysis of cancer cells. This approach has the potential for curing metastatic solid cancers such as colon, prostate, breast and others that resulted in over 560,000 deaths in the US in 2010.
Successful cancer drugs (Herceptin cost patients $6B and Avastin $7.6B in 2010) prolong life of metastatic cancer patients when combined with chemotherapy, without a doubt. Yet the effectiveness of these treatment is measured in months, not in terms of being cured. (At this meeting I’ve seen way too many Kaplan-Meier curves, something physicians are very familiar with.) T-cell immunotherapy has the potential for using the exquisite specificity of the body’s own immune system to eliminate cancer.
Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are taken from an individual’s metastatic lesion, activated with IL-2 and expanded ex-vivo (it is this process that is currently manual and labor-intensive), and after analysis and some additional processing re-introduced back into that same patient. When IL-2 is administered to patients directly, there was a relatively low rate of cancer regression – on the order of 5-10% for melanoma. Using T-cell immunotherapy, that number rises to 22% (he reported on 93 individuals, with 20 of them ‘complete responders’ with an average follow-up time of 8.8 years).
He showed a photograph of one complete responder who needed a second T-cell immunotherapy treatment, and the individual’s melanoma on the area beneath his ear was hard to look at. (It was about the size of a grapefruit.) But this individual is after 8 years showing no sign of recurrence, with the ‘after’ photograph a remarkable contrast to the first and intermediate ones.
He then went on to the mechanism of melanoma immunogenicity, using whole-exome sequencing of these individuals’ tumor for their SNV’s that may code for specific peptide antigens processed by our immune systems and presented by the MHC complex. From the exome sequence, they look for non-synonymous variants that change amino acid sequence (in comparison with their germline exome sequence), then computationally determine the 9-mer or 10-mer peptides that could be the specific individual’s antigens that the TIL’s are recognizing. By cloning and expressing these longer proteins (with the individual SNVs expressed as concatenated peptides), these are then processed by the patient’s TIL’s and then assayed for the ability to kill their own tumor cells in-vitro.
Think about that – taking an individual’s tumor and tumor infiltrating leukocytes, and that individual’s tumor exome sequence for all the coding genes in their cancer genome, and determining the exact 9-mer peptide that that individual’s own T-cells are using against the cancer that threatens life. In this specific example the gene identified was ERBB2IP, which Dr. Rosenberg coined the term “the ultimate ‘personalized therapy'”.
(I feel compelled to note here that next-generation sequencing is for research use only, and not for diagnostic procedures.)
He then went on to show data that of the population of TIL’s from a primary tumor from an individual, the majority of the cells (26.9%) were the specific T-cells against that specific tumor antigen.
We have come such a far way in tumor immunotherapy; it was satisfying from professional, scientific as well as personal levels.
For more information, here is a 2012 Perspectives piece by Steven published recently in Science Translational Medicine, and if you are interested in a more comprehensive review, here is a recent review by Hinrichs and Rosenberg in Immunological Reviews.

Chief








Surgery Branch








Senior Investigator
Head, Tumor Immunology Section









 Dr. Rosenberg pioneered the development of effective immunotherapies and gene therapies for patients with advanced cancers.  His studies of the adoptive transfer of genetically modified lymphocytes have resulted in the regression of metastatic cancer in patients with melanoma, sarcomas and lymphomas. 
His current research is aimed at defining the host immune response of patients to their cancers. These studies emphasize the ability of human lymphocytes to recognize unique cancer antigens  and the identification of anti-tumor T cell receptors that can be exploited to develop new cell transfer immunotherapies  for the treatment of cancer patients. 
As Chief, Dr. Rosenberg also oversees the Branch’s extensive clinical program aimed at translating scientific advances into effective immunotherapies for patients with cancer

 Dr. Rosenberg has pioneered the development of immunotherapy that has resulted in the first effective immunotherapies for selected patients with advanced cancer. His studies of cell transfer immunotherapy have resulted in durable complete remissions in patients with metastatic melanoma. He has also pioneered the development of gene therapy and was the first to successfully insert foreign genes into humans. His recent studies of the adoptive transfer of genetically modified lymphocytes has resulted in the regression of metastatic cancer in patients with melanoma, sarcomas and lymphomas.

The Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute is a combined laboratory and clinical research unit devoted to the development of innovative cancer immunotherapies and their translation to the treatment of patients with cancer. Efforts run the gamut from basic studies of cancer immunology to the conduct of clinical immunotherapy trials for patients with metastatic cancer. The Surgery Branch was responsible for the development of interleukin-2 (IL-2), the first effective immunotherapy in humans, the development of cell transfer immunotherapies for melanoma and other solid cancers, the first insertion of foreign genes into humans and the first development of effective human cancer immunotherapies based on the genetic engineering of autologous lymphocytes with genes encoding anti-tumor T cell receptors or chimeric antigen receptors.
Examples of current laboratory research involve the identification of the optimal properties of lymphocytes capable of mediating anti-tumor effects in experimental models and in the human and the development of immunotherapies based on the identification of unique exomic mutations expressed by cancers that can be targeted by cell transfer therapy. Extensive programs are in place for the genetic modification of lymphocytes to target cancer-testes antigens. The Surgery Branch offers postdoctoral fellowships in cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Clinical fellowships are available to surgical residents who have completed at least two years of residency and are interested in a combined program of laboratory and clinical research in immunotherapy.

About


 
The Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute is a combined laboratory and clinical research unit devoted to the development of innovative cancer immunotherapies and their translation to the treatment of patients with cancer. Efforts run the gamut from basic studies of cancer immunology to the conduct of clinical immunotherapy trials for patients with metastatic cancer. The Surgery Branch was responsible for the development of interleukin-2 (IL-2), the first effective immunotherapy in humans, the development of cell transfer immunotherapies for melanoma and other solid cancers, the first insertion of foreign genes into humans and the first development of effective human cancer immunotherapies based on the genetic engineering of autologous lymphocytes with genes encoding anti-tumor T cell receptors or chimeric antigen receptors.
Examples of current laboratory research involve the identification of the optimal properties of lymphocytes capable of mediating anti-tumor effects in experimental models and in the human and the development of immunotherapies based on the identification of unique exomic mutations expressed by cancers that can be targeted by cell transfer therapy. Extensive programs are in place for the genetic modification of lymphocytes to target cancer-testes antigens. The Surgery Branch offers postdoctoral fellowships in cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Clinical fellowships are available to surgical residents who have completed at least two years of residency and are interested in a combined program of laboratory and clinical research in immunotherapy.
