				Design is a brand's signature and its story.  We like to think of it as art for commerce, the culmination of research, relationships, strategic thinking, experience, intuition, and aesthetics. We believe that truly great design is about making something that adds richness to people's lives; something inspiring, memorable, funny, abrasive, ironic, elegant, ugly, human – anything but uninteresting.

				Impact, idea, allure, aesthetics, craftsmanship. A poster should communicate on many levels.  Art with a purpose, they announce, promote, challenge or inform, resulting in increased awareness or sales. We create posters that work equally well whether wheat-pasted on a brick wall in an alley or hanging in the Museum of Modern Art.

about
Established in 1989, Charles S. Anderson Design specializes in identity development, packaging, and product design, and is among the world’s most influential design firms. Unlike other design firms, however, in addition to their highly-recognized client work, CSA Design is unique in creating what has become one of the most extensive and well-respected archives of licensable artwork in existence. Painstakingly created over many decades, the CSA Images collection is a digital museum of art for commerce…a vast and ever-expanding resource of illustration inspired by the entire visual history of art, design, and typography.
Charles S. Anderson Design Company’s work has been exhibited in museums worldwide including The Permanent Collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Nouveau Salon des Cent—Centre Pompidou, Paris; The Smithsonian Institution's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, New York; The Institute of Contemporary Arts, London; The Library of Congress Permanent Collection, Washington D.C.; The Museum Für Gestaltung, Zürich; The Museum Für Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg; The Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris; The Museum of Modern Art, Hiroshima; and The Museum of Contemporary Art, Shanghai.
The firm’s work has also been featured in numerous prominent publications including The New York Times, In Style, Dwell, Fortune, Rolling Stone, Esquire, Time, Forbes, Entertainment Weekly, Newsweek, Vanity Fair, GQ, The LA Times, and ReadyMade, among others.
CSA Design has been awarded top honors in every major design competition, including multiple gold pencils from The One Show and multiple gold and silver awards from the New York Art Directors Club. 


timeline
In 1989, Charles S. Anderson Design was founded with a single client – The French Paper Company. While the firm has worked with many wonderful clients since, their partnership with French has endured as one of the longest-running, most prolific and internationally recognized client/designer relationships in the history of graphic design. 
In 1995, the firm launched CSA Images with their first collection of illustrations; indexed, categorized and available for licensing. The CSA Images collection originated in the 1970’s and is now one of the world’s most comprehensive, tightly-edited and highly-awarded archives of graphic illustrations, modern icons and design elements available. CSA Images licenses unique visual content worldwide to designers, art directors, retailers and manufacturers for use across a number of different media types including print, online, products, mobile and TV.
In 2003, CSA Design was selected to participate in the Design Triennial at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. The Triennial Exhibit is an overview of the best contemporary architecture, fashion design, graphic design, and industrial design in America.
In 2006, CSA Design launched the Pop Ink brand of licensed products, including paper products and objects d’art, in collaboration with French Paper.  Pop Ink products are backed by the extensive CSA Images library and printed on French Paper, establishing a retail paper product line for French.
In 2007, Charles S. Anderson Design Company’s work was again included in the Design Triennial at the Smithsonian Institution’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.
2011 marks the 25th year that Charles S. Anderson has worked with the French Paper Company, and the 140th Anniversary of French Paper.
2011-2012, CSA Design company's Pop Ink products are featured in the Walker Art Center / Cooper Hewitt international exhibition Graphic Design: Now In Production, the Walker's largest museum design exhibition in 22 years.
2013- STA Honorary Lifetime Membership Charles S. Anderson received the Society of Typographic Arts Honorary Lifetime Membership Award.
2014- AIGA Medal Charles S. Anderson received the American Institute of Graphic Arts Centennial Year Medal. The highest honor for exceptional achievement in the field of design.



philosophy
Our design is based on our impressions of the world around us – pieces of culture; sometimes popular, sometimes obscure. We turn those observations into a visual vocabulary that can be used to transform an impersonal product, concept, or entity into an approachable, accessible image with a distinctly human quality.  One that is equally at home on the printed page, the store shelf, or the digital realm.
In society's relentless push for modernism, it is possible to lose sight of the joy, the memories, the familiarity, the desire. When the human element is removed from the design process, it can create a situation where all brands become indistinguishable.  We see a different modernism in design evolving.  One not based on antiseptic minimalism and an absence of humanity, but one that is rich in cultural vocabulary and personal expression. A design philosophy and approach that first acknowledges where we came from and uses that understanding to create a new path to the future.
While we believe that strategy is important, we find that research works best when partnered with artistic intuition and put to use in marketing comprised of good ideas and attention-getting art. Our job as designers is not just to create a brand or deliver a message, but to give that brand or message a tangible and inherent artistic value that connects on a visceral, as well as visual, level.
Ultimately, in order to communicate a design must first be noticed. It should stand out and be unique, compelling, interesting, funny, strange…anything except boring, predictable, and just like everything else. The artistic quality of the finished piece is always our priority. Because unlike those who focus a little too heavily on the "commercial" in commercial art, we have no desire to be the biggest or the richest. We would, however, like to be the best.
"Design is a matter of intuition tempered with common sense." -Paul Rand
"The further backward you can look, the further forward you are likely to see." -Churchill



quotes
Steven Heller of the New York Times and prolific design author and historian, wrote, "Charles Anderson is a formalist, stylist, and entrepreneur who over the past twenty-five years—one generation—has made invaluable contributions to design and has produced design that represents the highest values of art and commerce. Moreover, he’s spawned a generation of strong designers. One can see his influence on designers who wed the past and present into contemporary stylistic manifestations. He has a personality and character to his work that is unique to him. If we measure our AIGA lifetime achievement medalists by the breadth of their shoulders, I think many stand on his without breaking his back."
Ellen Lupton, chief curator of the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York, wrote, “CSA Images, created by Charles S. Anderson Design Company, is fresh and witty, drawing on numerous twentieth-century commercial art styles, mixed with contemporary illustration approaches.”
The late Ikko Tanaka, one of Japan's founding modernist designers wrote, "Anderson Design has succeeded in creating a fashionable, alluring and widely admired style of graphic design that is truly American."
The late Philip B. Meggs, Professor, Virginia Commonwealth University, wrote, “I am delighted that you are going to make screen designs from the CSA website available for reproduction in the revised edition of A History of Graphic Design.  This will permit documentation of the more recent evolution of your work, while showing the involvement in web design, product design, and the new form and color approaches.  My efforts, as a design educator, to document the evolution of the graphic design field have only been possible as a result of the generous help of the pathfinders who created the history.  Thank you very much for helping with this effort!”

				We look at a package as an extension of the product within. It is the product's visible exterior at the point of sale – the place where buying decisions are made. To do its job effectively, it must be fresh, intelligent and engaging.  We combine the often-opposing principles of art and commerce to create packaging that stands out, is strategically on target, and most importantly, gets noticed.

				Illustration can be many things; bold or restrained, conceptual or decorative. But it should always have a clear point of view.  After creating illustrations for posters, advertising, books and publications, our style gained an international following inspiring us to launch CSA Images as a way to license our vast archive. CSA Images has since grown to become one of the most respected stock art resources worldwide.

				Most consumers are human beings, and we find that they relate pretty well to work that appears to have been designed by other human beings (especially passionate work that incorporates art, humanity, wit and humor). From the containers to their contents, nowhere is good design more important than in the creation of products.

				Turner Classic Movies 
				Logo Design
			
The TCM logotype we developed was brought to life with a series of 30 simple character icons, each representing a different movie category. Television is not a static medium, so we created an identity that could change and evolve, utilizing a different icon each time it appeared on screen. 
When the logotype and 30 different icons were presented to Ted Turner he asked "which one is the logo?" He was told all of them and it was explained how the series of icons were interchangeable. He replied "I understand, but which one is it? Which one is the real logo?" All of them! “But which one?”

testimonial
"As you can see from this new (but nowhere near as cool as TCM's) stationery, I have a new job. I moved over to TBS and am no longer responsible for Turner Classic Movies. I'll obviously miss TCM and I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate the vital role you played in helping us establish our identity." 
			-Bill Burke 
			President, Turner Broadcasting

Everyday Theology 
How to Read Cultural Texts and Interpret Trends


Anderson, Charles (Editor)	
									        	
									           			,  
									        		
									        		Anderson, Charles A. (Editor)	
									        	
									           			,  
									        		
									        		Sleasman, Michael J. (Editor)	
									        	
									




This first volume in the Cultural Exegesis series offers illustrative examples of how to read and understand cultural practices and social trends.




Description


										Everyday theology is the reflective and practical task of living each day as faithful disciples of Jesus Christ. In other words, theology is not just for Sundays, and it's not just for professional theologians. Everyday Theology teaches all Christians how to get the theological lay of the land. It enables them to become more conscious of the culture they inhabit every day so that they can understand how it affects them and how they can affect it. If theology is the ministry of the Word to the world, everyday theologians need to know something about that world, and Everyday Theology shows them how to understand their culture make an impact on it. Engaging and full of fresh young voices, this book is the first in the new Cultural Exegesis series.

  The same powerful principles from Dr. Neil T. Anderson's Steps to Freedom in Christ that helped set more than one million people free from spiritual bondage can now revolutionize marriages. Dr. Anderson and co-author Dr. Charles Mylander offer practical tools to help couples let go of old habits and destructive patterns, and place Christ firmly at the center of marriage. Step-by-step, they discuss ways to handle money, sex, gender differences, adultery and forgiveness. Readers will also learn how to find and speak their partner’s love language, resolve conflict and to call upon God in prayer to win the spiritual battle for their marriages. A thoughtful devotional guide will prompt further reflection, and discussion questions make this suitable for group use as well as personal  use. A special section, "Freedom in Christ", offers help for those battling specific spiritual or personal difficulties.

Former President of MD Anderson Charles LeMaistre dies at 92

1 / 12


Back to Gallery
















Charles LeMaistre, who served as former president of MD Anderson and as a University of Texas System chancellor, died Saturday, according to the hospital president.
Ronald DePinho, the current president of MD Anderson, said in a statement that LeMaistre pioneered cancer prevention and described the 92-year-old doctor  as "one of the giants of cancer medicine." 
When he retired from MD Anderson in 1996, former President George H.W. Bush said LeMaistre "will be missed, but the legacy of compassion and decency for which he is rightly known will continue to touch countless lives for many, many years to come."



LeMaistre's career centered around educating others on the dangers of smoking, serving on the first U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health in 1964. He also was the national president of the American Cancer Society. 
 "We are sad and will miss him," DePinho wrote. 
LeMaistre lived in Alamo Heights.

            Disclosure: I received complimentary products to facilitate this review. All opinions are my own. 


Setting Your Marriage Free  is a good marriage book for those who know their marriage isn't perfect and are looking for more. Even people with a pretty solid marriage will find nuggets of wisdom that will help enrich their relationship. There are discussion questions to use with your spouse or in a small group setting. The book also offers ways to use this book on your own, if you are in a situation where only one partner is interested in improving the relationship.


I felt like the book offered a solid foundation for love with each other and with God. The idea of setting your marriage free is a great way to empower both people in the marriage. It was great to go through it, and my husband and I do have a deeper relationship because of what we learned in this book.

            Perhaps I should start with a little background on myself. I have been married for almost 18 years. I was married at the age of 18 so, yep, in a little over a month, I will have been married for half my life. And I am happily married. I know I'm in a minority with that statement but it is 100% true so when I say a marriage book is worth reading (even when everything is great) I mean it.


What I'm so glad to read in "Setting your Marriage Free", by Neil T. Anderson and Charles Mylander, is the need to start at the source instead of the symptoms. There can't possibly be harmony between two people if there isn't harmony between them and their Savior first. They also talk about money, safe-guarding against adultery, and at length about what happens when only one person in the relationship is willing to work at making it better.


I like how each chapter is laid out. First the theory and then the practical. After all there's no point in reading about making your marriage better if you aren't willing to make changes in yourself. The last chapter of the book includes a step by step method to bettering your marriage no matter how great or how damaged it is.


If you are finding yourself in the midst of marital chaos and distress right now, I'm so sorry. Discord in the home is so painful. My prayer is that you will find peace - first with God and then with your spouse. Hang in there! I wouldn't say this lightly because I take marriage very seriously; this book will help if you are willing to learn from it and apply it.


I got a free copy of this book from Bethany House Publishing Group in exchange for an honest review.
