Bitcoin: The Winklevoss Twins Cannot Catch A Break - Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (Pending:COIN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Bitcoin: The Winklevoss Twins Cannot Catch A BreakMar.14.17 | About: Winklevoss Bitcoin (COIN) Andrew Hecht Commodities, long/short equity, medium-term horizon, long-term horizonMarketplaceHecht Commodity ReportSummaryBitcoin holds gains after SEC decision after an initial selloff.Another in a series of blows to the ego.A Bitcoin ETF could attract lots of action.Bitcoin at an all-time high.Is regulation of Bitcoin possible?On Friday, March 10, Bitcoin rose to the highest price in history when the cryptocurrency hit $1,285.74 against the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin trading was born in 2010 when the price was only 6 cents in dollar terms, and the asset has come a very long way since. There has been lots of debate surrounding the cryptocurrency. Some call it a commodity and others a currency. Most commodities are raw materials or hard assets that owners can hold in their hands or store for safe-keeping. One can only store Bitcoin in a computer wallet via a computer code. One of the most interesting things about Bitcoin is the blockchain technology that records a chain of ownership. Blockchain has many applications for other assets and could revolutionize the back-office function creating economies of scale and decreasing the cost of settling transactions across all assets. The current acting Chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commented on blockchain or DLT (distributed ledger technology) in January. "DLT may allow market participants to manage the enormous operational, transactional, and capital complexities brought about by Dodd-Frank. At the same time, it may provide regulators with the market visibility necessary to fulfill our mission to oversee healthy financial markets." The CFTC has designated Bitcoin as a commodity. Last Friday, the Bitcoin market faced a highly anticipated decision by another regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which ruled on a rule change that would have allowed for the creation of the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Gemini sought to list the ETF on the NYSE Arca exchange. The ETF was the brainchild and supported by the Winklevoss twins who are angel investors in Gemini. Bitcoin holds gains after SEC decision after an initial selloff
 As those who trade Bitcoin held their collective breath and waited for the decision from the SEC last Friday, the price of the cryptocurrency rallied to its all-time high. After all, an affirmative nod from the regulatory body would have opened the floodgates for investors to position in Bitcoin via an ETF product. 

(Source) As the price chart over the past few trading sessions highlights, Bitcoin fell to a low of $1,085.33 following the adverse decision from the SEC, a decline of 15.6% over the course of one-hour last Friday afternoon. The SEC said in their decision that they were unnerved by a market that operates on an unregulated basis largely outside of the United States. They went on to tell the market that the chances for market manipulation are high in the world of Bitcoin at this time. There are currently two other proposals before the SEC when it comes to an ETF product for Bitcoin, but Friday's decision handed another in a series of bruises to the ego of the Winklevoss twins. Despite the decision, the reasons that have caused the increase in value for Bitcoin remain strong. As a currency instrument, Bitcoin can float freely and its value comes from supply and demand for the cryptocurrency. While other foreign exchange instruments are subject to controls and manipulation by governments and monetary authorities around the world, Bitcoin is a pan-global means of exchange tool. In nations where currencies are not freely convertible, like China and Russia, the popularity of Bitcoin has soared. Therefore, by Monday, just a few days after the SEC handed down a decision that put an economic bullet into the twins' dreams of reaching the pinnacle of the cryptocurrency market, the price was right back up above the $1,240 level and trading near last week's highs. Eventually, there will be a market product that replicates the price action in Bitcoin, but the chances are that those poor Winklevoss twins lost their opportunity last week. It seems like everything they get involved in is a huge winner and at best, they only can capture a sliver of the value.
 Another in a series of blows to the ego The Winklevoss twins reached the height of their fame when they worked with Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard to develop Facebook. While Zuckerberg became a billionaire, the poor twins settled for $65 million in cash and Facebook stock which today is probably only worth a couple of hundred million. The twins argued in a lawsuit that they were the founders of the company and their piece of the Facebook pie amounts to a mere pittance when compared with Zuckerberg's net worth of which is north of $56 billion. Money cannot matter much to the twins these days as a couple of hundred million is probably more than both can spend in their lifetimes, but the blow to the ego from the SEC decision has probably sent both into deep analysis wondering why they just cannot get anything to go their way. After all, Facebook has been a sensation that has surpassed almost everyone's wild dreams, and the future Bitcoin ETF product will likely have a similar result. A Bitcoin ETF could attract lots of action One of the biggest problems with Bitcoin is that it is so foreign to the traditional investment community. Investing in Bitcoin requires a certain amount of computer savvy, imagination, and a wallet in one's computer to store the cryptocurrency. While many millennials have embraced Bitcoin, the nontraditional method of investing in and holding the asset has caused many seasoned investors and traders to avoid it like the plague. Whenever I write a piece on Bitcoin, I always get at least one comment asking why someone should invest in anything that is backed by nothing. The other comments express the same concern cited by the SEC and other regulatory bodies that manipulation is too rife in the market to make it a solid investment vehicle. An ETF product would go a long way towards acceptance of Bitcoin as a trading sardine. Face it, investors and speculators love volatility, and if they can trade an asset that offers wide price variance and trades on a bona fide exchange, it will go a long way to increasing market visibility and acceptance. A Bitcoin ETF product will succeed once the regulators figure out a way to understand the flows in that market and the exchanges are chomping at the bit knowing that the trading volumes and fees will be huge.
 Bitcoin at an all-time high Bitcoin did not fall apart in the wake of last week's SEC announcement to reject the ETF product offered by the twins. In fact, the price action following the announcement was just another example of another higher low for Bitcoin. 

 Source: http://www.coindesk.com/price/ As the chart dating back to March 2016 shows, the price of Bitcoin has tripled and has been making higher lows, and higher highs as more people around the globe embrace a currency or commodity that is simply a function of supply and demand and that transcends the forces of government. In an age where citizens in Western nations are rejecting decades of the status quo as exemplified by the Brexit vote and election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, the rise in popularity of Bitcoin should come as no surprise. Moreover, as individual wealth in China increases, the controlled nature of the currency and exportation of wealth creates the perfect environment for Bitcoin to thrive. For the time being, it could be a case of this week's highs are next week's lows for Bitcoin and the SEC decision has little to do with the future popularity and acceptance of the cryptocurrency. Is regulation of Bitcoin possible? Regulators are struggling to get their hands around Bitcoin under the pressure of exchanges that smell profits from transaction fees. If the U.S. regulators do not act fast enough, it is likely that a foreign exchange in a friendlier regulatory environment will capture market share and leave the U.S. exchanges in the dust, just like the Winklevoss twins. The CFTC was correct to label Bitcoin as a commodity. National interests tend to drive currencies, stocks, and bond prices over time which allows regulators to liaise with markets and exchanges to control and monitor flows. However, commodities are a different story given that production occurs in some regions of the world and consumption is ubiquitous. The CFTC regulates commodity prices within the United States and works with other cooperating nations to protect the markets from bad behavior. However, the U.S. regulators do not have the ability to control raw material markets on a pan-global basis, and they concentrate on the activity within the borders of the nation. If someone in the Ivory Coast decided to control and manipulate the price of cocoa, the regulators could not do much. OPEC has been attempting to manipulate the price of oil for decades, but it still trades actively and is regulated by the CFTC when it comes to trading on the U.S. futures market. Bitcoin is a commodity, and regulation needs to come with the full knowledge that what happens away from U.S. borders will be beyond the reach of regulatory bodies.
 The SEC ruling last week was short sighted in that their argument was specious. Commodities markets, like Bitcoin, operate largely outside of the U.S. and there are instances where market manipulation occurs. The CFTC is accustomed to regulating commodities and therefore should have the role of guiding the SEC. After all, there are currently Cocoa (NYSEARCA:NIB) and crude oil (USO and BNO) ETF and ETN products that the SEC has approved for trading, and there is little difference between a Bitcoin ETF and those products when it comes to the arguments presented by the SEC. The chances are that the regulatory body will eventually bite the bullet and approve an ETF product for Bitcoin. The problem for the Winklevoss twins is that they cannot catch a break. They will be left on the sidelines and on the outside looking in, once again, watching others make fortunes while wondering if they just have a dark cloud hanging over their heads. I have introduced a new weekly service through Seeking Alpha Marketplace. Each Wednesday I will provide subscribers with a detailed report on the major commodity sectors covering over 30 individual commodity markets, most of which trade on U.S. futures markets. The report will give an up, down or neutral call on these markets for the coming week and will outline the technical and fundamental state of each market. At times, I will make recommendations for risk positions in the ETF and ETN markets as well as in commodity equities and related options.

        Commentary: Bitcoin-backed fund sounds odd, but so did gold ETFs

Over the years, fund-industry watchers have laughed about a lot of wild investment ideas. Sometimes they laughed first. Sometimes they have gotten the last laugh. So when the fund observers started laughing last week after seeing the registration papers for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust — a new exchange-traded product that faces a lengthy vetting process from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission — the question was which laugh, first or last, will be the better one here, and who will get the final guffaw.

If the Winklevoss name rings a bell, that means you probably saw the movie “The Social Network,” or know enough about the origins of Facebook

                                         to know that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — twins who attended Harvard and rowed in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing — claimed that Mark Zuckerberg essentially stole their idea for the business. The twins walked away with a settlement worth $20 million in cash, and Facebook shares worth, conservatively, 10 times more.  If bitcoin rings a bell, then you are versed in what some people believe is the next great step in Internet and global commerce, a digital currency without borders or central bank, run by the people who use it. The value of bitcoins — today mostly used for anonymous online purchases — is determined by the marketplace; whatever someone will take for them is what they are worth, though their value has surged at times of international currency strife over the past two years, as happened during the Cyprus crisis in early 2013. Now let’s go back to the laughs for a moment. Industry watchers laughed when the first specialty Internet fund was launched back in the late 1990s, right up until the early iterations of those funds became a huge success (then those observers rushed into Net funds, only to see them crater). They also laughed just over a decade ago, at the first gold exchange-traded funds, saying funds backed by hard assets were a gimmick; today gold ETFs, combined, are the world’s fourth largest holder of gold, behind only the United States, Germany and the International Monetary Fund. Those are two good comparisons for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. Early Internet funds seemed unique but were really just buying businesses that had big online components to what they were doing. By comparison, the Bitcoin Trust could be looked at as just another currency fund, just with the unique — some would call it imaginary — currency of the bitcoin behind it.







Gold funds were unique because they were backed by hard assets. The bitcoin fund can’t do that because, well, bitcoins are digital. But the registration papers show that the twins claim a proprietary method for storing bitcoin holdings — they’ll charge a yet-to-be-specified management fee for maintaining this virtual storage — which would, in turn, make bitcoin holdings more liquid. Liquidity is important here because bitcoins have a volatile history. In the last year alone, they’ve traded between $13 and $266; Mt. Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange, had them trading in the $80-to-$90 range last week. Until you can cash them, however, that value is both speculative and ephemeral.

                  If you can’t actually spend bitcoins without converting them into conventional currency, one could argue that they aren’t so much a currency as a form of scrip.
                  

The Winklevoss filing noted, accurately, that bitcoins have little use in real-world retail and commercial markets compared with their “relatively large use by speculators.” If you can’t actually spend bitcoins without converting them into conventional currency, one could argue that they aren’t so much a currency as a form of scrip, a temporary money that has some value but that could become worthless overnight due to any number of structural, economic or market conditions. Another oddity of the Winklevoss Trust is that the brothers themselves have been buying up bitcoins, and their own stash may serve as the seed coins for the fund. Even if they truly believe in the future of bitcoin — and every interview or statement they’ve given suggests they think bitcoin is revolutionary — an investor can’t help but feel that the ETF is a way for them to backstop their own investment. (Relative to reported family fortunes or the Facebook settlement, the brothers’ bitcoin investment — reportedly $11 million as of April — is small potatoes.) Ultimately, if the Bitcoin Trust helps people interested in the currency to access and trade it, it’s a plus even if it’s not a commercial success. If bitcoin proves durable and lives up to the potential its supporters say it has, then the Winklevoss boys will cash in big time and be heavily imitated. As an investor, however, you probably don’t want to bet on that. The twins face a long, uphill battle just to get this fund to market; from there, chances are good it will still be viewed for years as a granular, niche fund — more like a fund that specializes in stocks from Bulgaria than one that has mainstream applications. Said Morningstar analyst Steven Pikelny: “I’d say this is a total gimmick. Bitcoins are very illiquid, and the current trading infrastructure is riddled with security/efficiency problems. … If you actually want exposure to bitcoins, it’s probably a better idea to buy them directly. And if you can’t figure out how to do that, you probably don’t have any business owning bitcoins in the first place.”

                Why The Winklevoss Twins' New Bitcoin ETF Matters            


    By John Kelleher 






Share





















































The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, currently moving towards regulatory approval, could be approved by the end of 2014 and will be a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), with each share representing an amount of bitcoin held by the Trust. Currently, such an investment vehicle is only available to wealthy investors, through funds like the Bitcoin Investment Trust.  The Winklevoss ETF will allow people with a brokerage account to invest in Bitcoin without having to worry about the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping bitcoin. (Read Investopedia's exclusive interview with Tyler Winklevoss.)
Proposed in 2013, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust was the first Bitcoin ETF to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but the Bitcoin Investment Trust announced plans in early 2014 to release an over-the-counter Bitcoin ETF. The latter is taking a different regulatory approach that does not require approval from the SEC, and has projected a launch in the fourth quarter of 2014.
What is an ETF?
ETF stands for exchange-traded fund, and is an investment fund that tracks an index, specific asset or basket of assets.  Many aspects of the market are covered by ETFs.  First introduced in 1989, ETFs are similar to index funds, but unlike index funds, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the day on the stock exchange.  They have low management fees, sometimes as low as 0.04%.
Background on the Winklevoss Twins
The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, gained notoriety through their lawsuit against the Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq:FB), from which they were awarded $20 million in cash and $45 million in Facebook stock in February 2008.  They rowed for the U.S. at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, went on to Oxford University's business school in the U.K., graduating in 2010, and then became venture capitalists.  In April 2013, they claimed to own 1% of all Bitcoin in existence.  On July 1, 2013, their company Math-Based Asset Services filed with the SEC a Form S-1 Registration Statement proposing the creation of a Bitcoin ETF called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. 
Motivations for a Bitcoin ETF
The S-1 filing describes shares of the ETF to be "Easily Accessible and Cost Efficient."  By offering a product that can be bought on an exchange, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust will allow investors to avoid the process of purchasing bitcoins on exchanges and having to handle storage.  The ETF price will also be based on a blended bitcoin price that reflects the volume-weighted average of top exchanges from across the world, whose current exchange rates can differ, and some of which may be difficult for investors to access.  Bitcoins can currently be bought on exchanges and through companies like Coinbase, but typically, set-up is required that requires the linking of a bank account and some level of identity verification.  Furthermore, secure storage of bitcoins by placing them into cold storage - that is, in wallets that are kept disconnected from the internet - can be technically challenging and investors may not want to take the responsibility of handling this.
A Bitcoin ETF traded on an exchange will give investors ways to implement various investment strategies such as shorting the ETF and buying it on margin.  Brokerages may also offer the ability to buy and sell options.  Furthermore, the release of a Bitcoin ETF will give Bitcoin exposure to the investing mainstream and add to its validity as a store of value and as a currency.
The Winkdex
An amendment to the S-1 SEC filing was filed on February 19, 2013, and it included an announcement of the Winklevoss Index, or Winkdex.  The Winkdex is a price index for Bitcoin.  From winkdex.com: The index is "calculated by blending the trading prices in U.S. dollars for the top three (by volume) qualified Bitcoin Exchanges during the previous two-hour period using a volume-weighted exponential moving average.  This proprietary formula weighs transactions proportionally by volume as well as exponentially by time to give greater weight both to the higher volume transactions and more recent transactions."  The top three exchanges by volume are selected from a set of five exchanges based on the volume exchanged over the previous 24-hour period.
Criticism
Some might argue the ETF provides no value if one can buy and hold bitcoin on a service like Coinbase without having to incur the recurring fees associated with the ETF.  Coinbase is a San Fransisco, Calif.-based company, backed by renowned venture capitalists such as Andreessen Horowitz, that provides Bitcoin services to consumers and merchants.  For a one-time fee, consumers can purchase bitcoin on Coinbase.  However, a Bitcoin ETF will allow investors the ability to exercise different investment strategies regarding Bitcoin that are not currently available in the U.S.
The Bottom Line
The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, originally proposed to the SEC on July 1, 2013, is currently working its way toward regulatory approval.  When approved, its shares will be issued at a price arrived at through a volume-weighted average of the Bitcoin price on leading Bitcoin exchanges across the world.  Anyone with access to a brokerage account will be able to purchase shares or exercise other investment strategies made available by the brokerage.

                Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust Names State Street As Its Administrator (STT)            


    By Prableen Bajpai, CFA (ICFAI) | October 21, 2016 — 7:13 AM EDT    






Share





















































Investors may soon be able to invest in a formally approved Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund. According to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have named State Street as administrator for the proposed Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) they are backing. The first application for the ETF dubbed as Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission more than three years ago in July 2013. (See also, Bitcoin ETFs: How Do They Work?)
State Street Corp. (STT) is a well-known financial services company that offers a broad range of financial products and services to institutional clients. It operates across more than a hundred countries and reported assets under management worth $2.25 trillion, as per its 2015 annual report. Since it has been named as the administrator and transfer agent, it would be providing day-to-day administrative and accounting services and be responsible for calculating the net asset value for the trust. 
The ETF is sponsored by Digital Asset Services, LLC, formally known as Math-Based Asset Services, LLC. Digital Asset is actively working with major global companies on blockchain technology which powers bitcoin. According to its official website, Digital Asset builds distributed, encrypted straight through processing tools, and their technology improves efficiency, security, compliance and settlement speed.
The filing introduces Gemini Trust Company, LLC as the custodian of the trust. It reads, “The Custodian will use its proprietary and patent-pending offline (i.e., air-gapped) hardware and software security technology (cold storage system) to store the trust’s bitcoins.” Other responsibilities include establishing the trust’s public bitcoin address and safekeeping of the private keys used to access and transfer the bitcoin.
What’s Already Available?
Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust offers investors a chance to invest in bitcoin. It is quoted on OCTQX under the symbol GBTC, but is only offered to accredited investors and currently has an AUM of $102.77 million. A year ago, ARK ETF Trust (ARKW) from ARK Investment Management invested in bitcoins by buying shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust. However, the allocation to bitcoins is below 3%. Investors have a long-term view of bitcoin can even add bitcoins to their retirement accounts through BitoinIRA by simply opening a self-directed IRA. (See also, How To Add Bitcoins To Your Retirement Account)
The Bottom Line
All these options offer bitcoin enthusiast investors a chance to gain exposure to the virtual currency without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping bitcoins. If the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is approved, it will be a credible addition to the investment products based on the price movement bitcoin. Overall, the addition of names such as State Street on the amendment is a clear sign that interest and confidence in bitcoin is on the rise.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday rejected a proposed rule change that would’ve allowed for the creation of the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund—a decision that has followers of the world’s largest cryptocurrency wondering what happens next. In its ruling, the SEC said it was unnerved by the lack of regulation in a market that is largely based outside of the U.S., and was worried about the potential for market manipulation.  Fortunately for investors who were hoping to buy into the fund, Friday’s decision won’t necessarily preclude the approval of other proposed bitcoin ETFs. Two other companies are vying to become the first bitcoin-focused ETF, but what might happen next is unclear.  The New York Stock Exchange filed a proposed rule change with the SEC on Jan. 25 to allow the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to trade on its ETF exchange, NYSE Arca. The agency now has until Friday, Sept. 22 to issue its ruling. Barry Silbert, the chief executive officer of the Digital Currency Group, Grayscale’s parent company, declined to comment on the Winklevoss decision.  NYSE Arca filed another rule-change proposal to list shares of the SolidX Bitcoin Trust, another product vying to be the first bitcoin ETF, back in July, but it is unclear what is happening and representatives for SolidX couldn't be reached for comment.  One factor that differentiated the Winklevoss proposal from its rivals was the mechanism for tracking the bitcoin price. The Winklevosses planned to use pricing data gleaned from Gemini, a digital-currency exchange launched in late 2015 that commands less than 1% of the bitcoin market.  Both the Grayscale and SolidX proposals would peg the price to the TradeBlock bitcoin index. Grayscale’s proposal is widely viewed as the favorite within the bitcoin community, largely because shares of its trust

                                         already trade over-the-counter, often at a premium to bitcoin’s net-asset value.  But some have expressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest at Grayscale. In a comment letter filed with the SEC, Jeffrey Wilcke, a representative of the Ethereum Foundation, pointed out the relationship between the Grayscale trust and CoinDesk, an online news service that covers the digital-currency market. Both Grayscale and CoinDesk are owned by DCG. Wilcke couldn't be reached for comment.  Jerry Brito, chief executive director of Coin Center, a bitcoin advocacy group, said the SEC’s concerns about regulation create a “chicken and egg problem.” “How do we develop well-capitalized and regulated markets in the U.S. and Europe if financial innovators aren’t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like bitcoin?,” he said in an emailed statement.  When asked about what’s next for bitcoin, Chris Burniske, blockchain analyst and products lead at ARK Invest, said it is “clear that the SEC still has a way to go in terms of getting comfortable with the bitcoin markets.”  Bitcoin market experts said the Winklevoss’s could modify their proposal to address some of the agency’s concerns, but that they would need to start the process again from the beginning, and that BATS would need to issue a new proposed rule change, which the agency would then have a maximum of 240 days to consider.  For their part, the Winklevoss brothers say they remain committed to bringing “COIN” to market.  “We began this journey almost four years ago, and are determined to see it through. We agree with the SEC that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors,” said Tyler Winklevoss in an emailed statement.

                                         sold off sharply after the decision, with the price of a single coin losing $250 in a matter of minutes. But it quickly bounced back, and was trading down 6.3% on the day at $1,116 late Friday in New York, according to the CoinDesk bitcoin price index.  Spencer Bogart, the head of research at Blockchain Capital, said this is evidence that the ETF presented “no change to bitcoin’s compelling fundamental growth story.”  “The drivers of bitcoin demand remain as strong now as they were two months ago before the ETF fervor arrived,” he said.

Wall Street isn’t ready for a 1,100-point tumble in the Dow industrials
              
              The U.S. stock market is on such a parabolic march higher that Wall Street investors may have forgotten what a typical daily downturn feels like anymore.              
              
            

9:15 p.m. July 28, 2017






Long-dated Treasury yields see weekly climb 
              
              Long-dated Treasury yields rose for the week as recovering commodity values and strong readings in economic data raised growth and inflation expectations.

S&P 500, Nasdaq finish lower after Amazon disappointment; Dow closes at record
              
              The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both finish slightly lower on Friday for weekly losses as Amazon.com shares slump on disappointing earnings, while the Dow industrials finishes at a record for a weekly gain.              
              
            

4:33 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dow industrials just 170 points shy of 22,000 milestone
              
              The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged wrapped up at an all-time closing high Friday, ending the week u 1.2% higher, even as the broader market was weighed by a recent slump in shares of technology companies. But notably, the Dow finds itself just 170 points away from hitting another psychological milestone: 22,000. The Dow last hit 21,000 on March 1, but has advanced in fits and starts over the past five months amid growing doubts about how quickly President Donald Trump can implement pro-growth policies pledged during his campaign for the White House. A late-Friday defeat in passing a bill to revamp the Affordable Care Act, underlines those fears. Still, the blue-chip gauge has enjoyed a relatively steady climb, powered by strong moves in shares of Boeing Co. , which has been a key driver of the price-weighted average in recent weeks and months. Boeing shares have climbed 55% so far this year, making it the best performer in the benchmark. The Dow closed on Friday up 0.2% at a record 21,830, the S&P 500 index , meanwhile, ended down 0.1% at 2,472, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  fell 0.1% at 6,374.              
              
            

4:18 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dow ends at record; S&P 500, Nasdaq see weekly fall
              
              The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced modestly on Friday to close at an all-time high, with gains this week fueled by earnings from bellwether companies such as Boeing  and Verizon Communication . The Dow  added 33.76 points, or 0.2%, to 21,830.31 and gained 1.2% over the week. But broader markets slipped on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also posting modest weekly losses. The S&P 500  closed 3.32 points, or 0.1%, lower at 2,472.10, retreating from record levels set on Wednesday. The benchmark index finished the week roughly where it started. The Nasdaq Composite index  declined 7.51 points, or 0.1%, to 6,374.68 and ended the week 0.2% lower. On Friday, sharp post-earnings losses from Amazon.com  weighed on the main indexes.

The Securities and Exchange Commission denied an application for the first exchange-traded fund that would track the price of bitcoin, a high-profile rejection for the digital currency and the Winklevoss brothers behind the proposal. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust first applied for approval of the product nearly four years ago. The bitcoin industry had been hoping an exchange-traded product would make...

by Giulio Prisco 
   Jul 14, 2016  12:10 PM EST









Blockchain technology company SolidX Partners has announced that it has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the proposed launch of the SolidX Bitcoin Trust, a new Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) for traditional investors.
According to the company's website, SolidX Partners provides blockchain-based software solutions relating to the indelible recording of digital records, transfer of assets, and identity. “SolidX also has a capital markets arm that has filed a FORM S-1 registration statement for a proposed launch of a bitcoin exchange traded fund,” reads a recently added paragraph.
The SolidX press release reveals that the ETF will list on NYSE Arca, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) market specialized in Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs), under the ticker symbol XBTC. The Trust, not actively managed, will provide shareholders with exposure to the daily change in the U.S. dollar price of Bitcoin, before expenses and liabilities of the Trust, as measured by the TradeBlock XBX Index.
The SolidX SEC filing has been covered by the financial press, including The Wall Street Journal and Reuters, which indicates the growing interest in Bitcoin among traditional investors who want to bet on (or short) the price of Bitcoin without going through the hassle of buying or selling the digital currency itself.
“The SolidX Bitcoin [Trust] will issue SolidX Bitcoin [Shares], which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust,” states the filing. “The Trust’s assets will consist of bitcoin, an asset that can be transferred among parties via the Internet, but without the use of a central administrator or clearing agency. The Trust will occasionally hold cash for short periods in connection with the purchase and sale of bitcoin, and to pay Trust expenses. The Shares are issued by the Trust only in one or more blocks of 10,000 Shares, called a ‘Basket,’ principally in exchange for cash. The Trust will issue and redeem Shares in Baskets to certain registered [Authorized Participants]. Shares will be offered to the public from time to time at prices that will reflect, among other things, the price of bitcoin and the trading price of the Shares on NYSE Arca at the time of the offer.”
NYSE Arca trades more than 8,000 exchange-listed securities and is ranked first in the listing and trading of ETPs, such as ETFs, exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs), According to NYSE Arca, ETPs are one of the fastest growing investment products in the world, combining the simplicity of stocks with the diversified risk of mutual funds.
Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, has analyzed the differences between the SolidX Bitcoin Trust and the long anticipated Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. The Winklevoss twins recently filed with the SEC to switch the listing of their proposed ETF Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust to Bats Global Markets from Nasdaq, CNBC reported last month.
Brito notes that the most interesting contrast between the two proposed funds is what happens if their bitcoins are lost or stolen. 
“The Trust will not insure its bitcoin,” states the Winklevoss filing. On the contrary, SolidX has secured insurance for its bitcoin holdings.
“The Trust will maintain crime, excess crime and excess vault risk insurance coverage underwritten by various insurance carriers,” states the SolidX filing. “The purpose of the insurance is to protect shareholders against loss or theft of the Trust’s bitcoin. The insurance will cover loss of bitcoin by, among other things, theft, destruction, bitcoin in transit, computer fraud (i.e., hacking attack) and other loss of the private keys that are necessary to access the bitcoin held by the Trust.” The insurance is explained in detail in the section “The Trust’s Bitcoin Insurance” of the filing.
“Investors are understandably interested in bitcoin,” says a Quartz article, noting that Bitcoin Tracker One, a trust listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, is up 66 percent since April 1. Greyscale Bitcoin Trust, which trades on the OTC markets and was created by Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, is up 120 percent over the same period.
“Since those are on smaller exchanges, they are more difficult for investors to access,” concludes Quartz. In fact, it’s to be expected that availability on a major stock exchange like the NYSE will open XBTC to more investors, and boost Bitcoin’s appeal to traditional investors.

If you have an online brokerage account, you can now buy shares in a fund that aims to track the price of the digital currency called bitcoin. Just don’t expect a smooth ride. Bitcoin is a highly speculative investment—the kind most financial advisers say investors should only buy into with money they can afford to lose. But some analysts think the new fund could bring the digital currency a step closer to broader acceptance by investors. For that to happen, the fund will have to overcome some early difficulties.

Bitcoin Investment Trust

        GBTC 3.70%


       started trading on the OTCQX market on May 4 under the ticker symbol GBTC. It isn’t technically an exchange-traded fund, but it’s designed to work like one. (The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing an application for what would be the first official bitcoin ETF, the 





         Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.

      )  Bitcoin Investment Trust is small, with a net asset value of only $35.6 million at the end of June and only 1.4 million shares outstanding. Its tracking of bitcoin’s price has been inconsistent, and there is a wide spread between the share price and the value of the underlying assets. Oh, and by the end of last month the share price had fallen 28% from its $42 close on the first day of trading, to $30.12. Sparking interest? Still, some analysts think the fund could prompt some speculative interest in bitcoin, like the launch of gold ETFs did in precious metals a decade ago. Gil Luria, an analyst with brokerage firm Wedbush Securities who has followed the bitcoin market since its infancy, sees Bitcoin Investment Trust as part of bitcoin’s move toward the mainstream of finance. Other recent signs of acceptance on Wall Street include the decision of the New York State Department of Financial Services to regulate itBit Trust Co., a small bitcoin exchange, and research from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. claiming a place for bitcoin in “the future of finance.”  “The OTCQX listing is also a very big step forward,” says Mr. Luria. “It has made at least a proxy ownership stake in bitcoin available to practically every institutional and retail investor.” Anyone can buy bitcoin directly, but it involves headaches including the need for specialized software for secure transactions. When the 





         SPDR Gold Shares

       ETF launched in November 2004, gold futures were trading at about $400 an ounce. The popularity of the fund was part of a gold craze that saw prices quintuple over the next seven years. “Investors historically have chosen to offload the friction of buying and securing gold directly for a reasonable fee,” says 



      Cameron Winklevoss, 



       one of the founders of Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. “We believe some investors will behave the same with regards to bitcoin and a bitcoin [exchange-traded product].” Bitcoin is even more volatile than gold in its speculative heyday, and even trickier to buy and sell directly. And the bitcoin market is far smaller and younger than the gold market was in 2004. But there are reasons to believe bitcoin usage could increase. In a recent Goldman Sachs survey of 752 millennials, 44% said they have used, do use or will use bitcoin. And well over 100,000 merchants world-wide, from individuals to corporations, accept bitcoin for at least some payments, the firm says. Share shortage In addition to investors’ attitudes about the digital currency, Bitcoin Investment Trust is wrestling with some practical issues. For one, the fund’s shares trade at a sizable premium to the underlying assets—19% on July 1. That’s because of the fund’s origins as a private trust.  Investors in the private trust could sell their shares on the public market after a 12-month lockup. Those sales began May 4, but shares have only become available gradually as the private investors liquidate their holdings. The shortage of shares has boosted their market value.






The bitcoin fund has high fees by ETF standards, at 2%.

But Mr. Luria expects nearly all of the original trust investors to sell their shares publicly by September, creating what he calls a “critical mass” of shares on the market—or enough to bring the price of the fund’s shares more into line with prices on the bitcoin market. The fund also has high fees by ETF standards, at 2%. And it may soon have competition from the proposed Winklevoss fund. Already, Nasdaq has launched an exchange-traded note that tracks the price of bitcoin on its Stockholm exchange.  However investors come to view the fund, some veteran money managers see it as the latest in a long line of tenuous and risky investment products. “I think a bitcoin ETF says as much about the popularity of ETFs as it does about the popularity of bitcoin,” says 



      Eric Marshall, 



       a portfolio manager for mutual-fund firm Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. “Now there’s an ETF for everything.”  Mr. Curran, a writer in Denton, Texas, is a regular contributor to Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal. Email rob.curran@dowjones.com.

Proceeds received by the Trust from the issuance and sale of Baskets, including
the Seed Baskets and the Shares (which are described on the front page of this
prospectus), will consist of bitcoin deposits. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
during the life of the Trust such proceeds will only be (1) held by the Trust,
(2) distributed to Authorized Participants in connection with the redemption of
Baskets, or (3) disbursed to pay the Sponsor’s Fee or sold as needed to pay the
Trust’s expenses not assumed by the Sponsor.


Bitcoins are not the only type of Digital Math-Based Assets founded on 
math-based algorithms and cryptographic security, although it was considered the
most prominent as of December 26, 2014. At least 600 other Digital Math-Based 
Assets or “altcoins” have been developed since the Bitcoin Network’s inception, 
including Litecoin, Peercoin, Dogecoin, Ripple and Stellar. The Bitcoin Network,
however, possesses the “first-to-market” advantage and thus far has captured the
majority of the industry’s market share and is secured by a mining network with 
significantly more processing power than that of any other Digital Math-Based 
Asset.


Company Description
The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust, organized on December 30, 2014, under
the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (“DSTA”) and operates pursuant to the Trust
Agreement between the Sponsor and the Trustee (“Trust Agreement”), which sets
forth the respective rights and duties of the Sponsor and the


 Trustee and
authorizes the Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, to enter into a custody
agreement (“Trust Custody Account Agreement”) with a custodian. [  ]
(“Custodian”) serves as custodian to the Trust under the Trust Custody Account
Agreement, which establishes the segregated custody account of the Trust that
will be used to hold the bitcoins deposited with the Custodian on behalf of the
Trust (“Trust Custody Account”).

The Trust holds bitcoins, which are a digital commodity that is not issued by
any government, bank or central organization. Bitcoins are based on an open
source math-based protocol existing on an online, peer-to-peer computer network
that hosts the public transaction ledger, known as the "Blockchain," and the
software source code that provides the rules for bitcoin movement and ownership
and the peer-to-peer computer network ("Bitcoin Network" or "Bitcoin"). The
Bitcoin software source code includes the math-based protocols that govern the
creation of bitcoins and the cryptography system that secures and verifies
transactions in bitcoins. Bitcoins themselves have no physical existence beyond
the record of transactions on the Blockchain. The Blockchain serves as a public
record of the custody of all bitcoins and the flow of funds in all Bitcoin
transactions, including the initial creation allocation of bitcoins to a digital
wallet and all subsequent movements of bitcoins in later transactions between
users' digital wallets. The Bitcoin Network utilizes the Blockchain to evidence
the existence of bitcoins in any user's digital wallet. Bitcoin digital wallets
are accessed and may be used to receive or send bitcoins through a digital
address together with a public key and private key that are part of the Bitcoin
Network's cryptographic security mechanism.

The Trust is expected from time to time to issue Baskets in exchange for
deposits of bitcoins and to distribute bitcoins in connection with redemptions
of Baskets. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect
the performance of the price of Bitcoins, as measured by the Winklevoss IndexSM
("Winkdex®"), less the Trust's expenses. The Sponsor believes that, for many
investors, the Shares will represent a cost-effective and convenient means to
access exposure to bitcoins. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided 
beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and are expected to be traded
under the ticker symbol "COIN" on the NASDAQ.

The Trust's Sponsor is Math-Based Asset Services, LLC. The Sponsor is a Delaware
limited liability company formed on May 9, 2013, and is wholly-owned by
Winklevoss Capital Management LLC. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company
Act and the governing documents of the Sponsor, Winklevoss Capital Management
LLC, the sole member of the Sponsor, is not responsible for the debts,
obligations and liabilities of the Sponsor solely by reason of being the sole
member of the Sponsor. The Sponsor will be the exclusive licensee, within the
field of use of operation of an exchange traded fund, of certain patent-pending
intellectual property regarding the operation of the Trust and the Trust's
hardware and software security system ("Security System"). Winklevoss IP LLC is
the owner of and is licensing to the Sponsor such intellectual property for use
by the Trust and its service providers in the operation of the Trust.

The Sponsor arranged for the creation of the Trust and will arrange for the
registration of the Shares for their public offering in the United States and
their listing on the NASDAQ. The Sponsor has agreed to assume the following
administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee's
monthly fee and expenses, including indemnification amounts, reimbursable under
the Trust Agreement, the Administrator's monthly fee and expenses reimbursable
under the Trust Servicing Agreement, the Trust Agency Service Provider's monthly
fee and expenses under the Trust Agency Service Provider Agreement, the
Custodian's monthly fee and expenses reimbursable under the Trust Custody
Agreement, Exchange listing fees, US Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees, up to $[  ] per annum
in marketing expenses and up to $[100,000] per annum in legal expenses. The
Sponsor will also pay the costs of the Trust's organization and the initial sale
of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration fees.

Delaware Trust Company, a Delaware trust company, acts as the trustee of the
Trust for the purpose of creating a Delaware statutory trust in accordance with
the DSTA. The Trustee is appointed to serve as the trustee of the Trust in the
State of Delaware for the sole purpose of satisfying the requirement of Section
3807(a) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act that the Trust have at least one
trustee with a principal place of business in the State of Delaware. The duties
of the Trustee will be limited to (i) accepting legal process served on the
Trust in the State of Delaware and (ii) the execution of any certificates
required to be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State which the Delaware
Trustee is required to execute under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. To the
extent that, at law or in equity, the Trustee has duties (including fiduciary
duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust or the Shareholders, such
duties and liabilities will be replaced by the duties and liabilities of the
Trustee expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement. The Trustee will have no
obligation to supervise, nor will it be liable for, the acts or omissions of the
Sponsor, Administrator, Trust Agency Service Provider, Custodian or any other
Person.

[  ], the Administrator of the Trust, is generally responsible for the
day-to-day administration of the Trust under the Trust Servicing Agreement and
in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. This includes
(1) receiving and processing orders from Authorized Participants to create and
redeem Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with the Trust
Agency Service Provider and The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"),
(2) calculating the NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share, (3) instructing the
Custodian to transfer the Trust's bitcoins as needed to pay the remuneration due
to the Sponsor ("Sponsor's Fee") in bitcoins (such bitcoin transfers are
expected to occur approximately monthly in the ordinary course), (4) instructing
the Custodian to transfer the Trust's bitcoins as needed to pay any
extraordinary Trust expenses that are not assumed by the Sponsor and (5) selling
or directing the sale of the Trust's remaining bitcoins at termination of the
Trust and distributing the cash proceeds to the owners of beneficial interests
in the Shares ("Shareholders") of record.

The Trust's Trust Agency Service Provider is [  ], who is authorized by the
Sponsor under the Trust Agreement to serve as the transfer agent in accordance
with the provisions of the Trust Agency Service Provider Agreement. The Trust
Agency Service Provider, among other things, provides transfer agent services
with respect to the creation and redemption of Baskets by Authorized

                            SEC Opens Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust Filing for Public Comment                        

Jul 11, 2016 at 18:55 UTC by Michael del Castillo


















Regulation  •  News  •  Regulation 







































Investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are another step closer to offering the first Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulated bitcoin investment product following a request for comment published Friday.
Last month, BATS proposed a rule change that would result in the listing and trading of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Shares issued by the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. Now, in response to that request, SEC assistant secretary Jill Peterson has opened the proposal for comment from the public.
Peterson wrote:
"In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change."
According to the SEC, it will approve or disapprove the request within 45 day of its posting on Friday, unless a longer period of up to 90 days is deemed necessary.
The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust was founded three years ago by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss to give accredited investors access to bitcoin, and this is the most recent development from the firm that indicates progress in its effort to gain SEC approval.
After two years of working to get listed under the "COIN" symbol on Nasdaq, the investors submitted paperwork last month to officially change their listing exchange to BATS.
No material changes are expected to be made to the rule as a result of the request last week. Rather, BATS is required to submit the form given the specific nature of the offering as an instrument for commodities.
