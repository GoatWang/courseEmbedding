Ladera Ranch, Calif.–Strategic Storage Trust II, a public, non-traded REIT which is sponsored by SmartStop Asset Management LLC, has agreed to acquire a 27-property self-storage portfolio from Mindful Storage. The total value of the transaction amounts to $371 million, Inside Self-Storage reported based on a March 25 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Security Self Storage, Royal Palm Beach, Fla.
The portfolio comprises 22 properties in three states, offering a total of more than 1.5 million square feet. Ten facilities are located in Florida, 11 in North Carolina (eight of which are in Asheville) and one in Maryland. The transaction also includes land parcels adjacent to four of the properties and one redevelopment site in North Carolina.
According to the filing, the deal will be executed through 12 purchase-and-sale agreements with unaffiliated third parties. Strategic Storage Trust II structured the transaction through a subsidiary of Strategic Storage Operating Partnership II LP, the REIT’s operating partnership. The purchase price for the 22 self-storage facilities is about $367 million, while the separate parcels of land will be acquired for approximately $3.6 million. Strategic Storage Trust II expects to close on the entire portfolio during this year’s second or third quarter.
The Mindful Storage portfolio operates under several brands including Abby Self Storage, Cypress Self Storage, Fullerton Self Storage, George’s Stor-Mor, Security Self Storage, Storage Center and Stowaway. Mindful Storage is a division of the Mindful Group, a Florida-based real estate company focused on acquisitions, development and property management.
The expansion will substantially increase the California-based REIT’s presence in Florida and North Carolina. According to its website, SST II currently owns two self-storage facilities in Florida totaling 124,900 net rentable square feet and three in North Carolina comprising 159,600 square feet. Earlier this year, SST II also expanded to Canada, with the purchase of three properties in the Greater Toronto Area. The REIT’s current portfolio includes 23,880 self-storage units and approximately 2.6 million rentable square feet of storage space.
SmartStop Asset Management manages 61 self-storage facilities comprising 4.2 million rentable square feet in Canada and the U.S. The company also sponsors Strategic Storage Growth Trust Inc., another public, non-traded REIT focused on self-storage assets.

Strategic Storage Trust II, Inc. (SST II) Acquires LA County Self Storage Facility for $4.7 Million




/EINPresswire.com/ -- LANCASTER, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 01/19/16 --  Strategic Storage Trust II, Inc. (SST II) -- which is sponsored by SmartStop Asset Management, LLC -- recently purchased a self storage facility consisting of approximately 550 units across approximately 71,900 rentable square feet for approximately $4.7 million located at 43707 North Sierra Hwy. in Lancaster, Calif.


"Since we currently own another asset in Lancaster about 100 yards away, this represents an opportunity for economies of scale on the expense side as some costs will be combined," said H. Michael Schwartz, chairman and CEO of SST II. "Also, the unit mix of the two properties is mutually complementary so it's a beneficial addition for both assets on the revenue side. This is a case where one plus one equals more than two."



The 10-building facility, which was built in 1991, is approximately 88% occupied. The property sits on approximately 4.8 acres and offers drive-up units, interior units and RV spaces.


In addition to the Lancaster facility, SST II owns the following self storage properties located in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA):


43745 Sierra Hwy. in Lancaster (700 units; 64,700 square feet) 
10231 South Colima Rd. in Whittier (510 units; 58,600 square feet) 
2234 Arrow Hwy. in La Verne (520 units; 49,800 square feet) 
1571 West Foothill Blvd. in Upland (610 units; 56,500 square feet) 
404 Potrero Grande in Monterey Park (390 units; 31,200 square feet) 
580 East Lambert Rd. in La Habra (420 units; 51,400 square feet) 
7611 Talbert Ave. in Huntington Beach (610 units; 61,000 square feet) 
4200 Westminster Ave. in Santa Ana (840 units; 84,500 square feet)


About Strategic Storage Trust II, Inc. (SST II)


Strategic Storage Trust II, Inc. (SST II) is a public non-traded REIT that focuses on stabilized self storage properties. The SST II portfolio includes approximately 20,000 self storage units and approximately 2.2 million rentable square feet of storage space.

Update 6/6/16 – SST II has completed its purchase of the 10 Florida facilities and single Maryland facility from Mindful Storage. The acquisition comprises 985,500 rentable square feet of storage space in about 9,540 units. The Maryland facility is Fullerton Self Storage in Baltimore, which contains 100,600 square feet in 1,080 units. The Florida properties are:





 









Abby Self Storage, 10451 N.W. 33rd St., Doral—71,500 square feet, 1,030 units
Cypress Self Storage, 7755 Preserve Land, Naples—75,900 square feet, 800 units 
Mindful Storage, 189 Linton Blvd., Delray—121,500 square feet, 900 units
Security Self Storage, 2581 Jupiter Park Drive, Jupiter—87,400 square feet, 820 units 
Security Self Storage, 8135 Lake Worth Road, Lake Worth—78,100 square feet, 830 units 
Security Self Storage, 10325 W. Broward Blvd., Plantation—89,800 square feet, 910 units

Security Self Storage, 1341 State Road 7, Wellington—81,700 square feet, 730 units 

"The Mindful acquisition is accretive to our portfolio in many categories, including asking rents and occupancy," said H. Michael Schwartz, CEO and chairman of SST II. "At 96 percent occupancy, these 11 properties represent a proven income stream with imbedded operational upside."
"We like the diversity of these assets across the southern half of Florida," said Wayne Johnson, chief information officer for SST II. "There are 10 stores spread among five counties, each in dense and established markets. The Baltimore property is in a region that we know well from a historical perspective and fits within our future growth plans."


 4/7/16 – Strategic Storage Trust II Inc. (SST II), a public, non-traded, self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) sponsored by SmartStop Asset Management LLC, has agreed to acquire a 27-property portfolio from Mindful Storage for approximately $371 million, based on a March 25 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The deal includes 22 self-storage facilities in three states, as well as land parcels adjacent to four of those properties and one redevelopment site in North Carolina. The active portfolio, which comprises more than 1.5 million square feet, includes 10 facilities in Florida, 11 in North Carolina and one in Maryland.
The deal will be executed through 12 purchase-and-sale agreements with unaffiliated third parties, according to the filing. SST II structured the deal through a subsidiary of Strategic Storage Operating Partnership II LP, the REIT’s operating partnership. The purchase price for the 22 self-storage facilities is about $367 million. The separate land deals will be acquired for approximately $3.65 million. SST II expects to close on the entire portfolio during the second or third quarter.
Mindful Storage is a division of the Mindful Group, a Florida-based real estate company focused on acquisitions, development and property management. The Mindful Storage portfolio operates under several brand names including Abby Self Storage, Cypress Self Storage, Fullerton Self Storage, George’s Stor-Mor, Security Self Storage, Storage Center and Stowaway, according to the company website. Mindful Management LLC serves as corporate headquarters for self-storage and other real estate properties. Its operating portfolio includes 1.8 million square feet of self-storage, commercial, medical office and residential assets.
Officials from Mindful, SmartStop Asset Management and SST II have not yet commented publicly on the deal.
The acquisitions will substantially increase the SST II footprint in Florida and North Carolina. The REIT currently has two facilities in Florida comprising 124,900 net rentable square feet and three in North Carolina comprising 159,600 square feet, according to its website. Eight of the 11 North Carolina facilities in the Mindful stable are in Asheville.
The SST II portfolio currently includes 23,880 self-storage units and approximately 2.6 million rentable square feet of storage space. 
SmartStop Asset Management has a managed portfolio of 61 self-storage facilities comprising 4.2 million rentable square feet in Canada and the United States. The company also sponsors Strategic Storage Growth Trust Inc., a public, non-traded REIT also focused on self storage assets.
