One Time Set-Up Program
What is Psychemedics’ One Time Set-Up Service?

        A One Time Set-Up Service is when a one time only, non emergency collection is needed in an area where the company does not
        generate enough volume to warrant establishing clinics to provide ongoing collections.
    
The following steps are completed during a One Time Set-Up Program:



            A Company representative may email the donor information to onetimesetupservice@psychemedics.com, OR complete the online form below:

Psychemedics locates  a provider:

                -  Psychemedics provides the closest, least expensive provider available.  This is typically within 30 minutes of the donor.
                -  Psychemedics faxes your company information to the provider.  (Company and donor specifics plus billing details.)
                -  A kit, Custody and Control Form and a FedEx airbill will be shipped overnight to the clinic, or the donor carries a Custody and Control Form and/or an authorization form in with them.
            


            Psychemedics notifies the company representative via email of the clinic name, address, telephone number, contact name and hours of operation.
        

            If the collection site notifies Psychemedics, we will notify the Client that the donor is a “no show” or if there is any other problem
            with the collection.
        

            Psychemedics pays the collection bill received by the provider.
        

            Psychemedics bills the Company for the service provided, including a one time set-up fee of $10.

Workplace Testimonials

  With the high possibility of inaccurate urine testing and the fact that most of the more serious Class 1 & Class 2 drugs are out of the system after a short period of time and won’t be detected in a urinalysis test, I don’t know why any company would continue to use urinalysis for pre-employment testing. Our accident rate and workers compensation claims dropped significantly after implementing Psychemedics hair testing.Risk Management Coordinator / Investigative NursePsychemedics hair testing enables us to provide our team members a safer workplace by employing the most effective, accurate and reliable method of detecting illegal drug use.HR SpecialistThe Vector program is one of the most innovative drug and alcohol programs to serve the owner and contractor community in years. The flexibility built into the VECTOR process allows for a greater return of investment for Owners and Contractors.CEO of Safety CouncilWe did what the Department of Transportation said we had to do [urine], but they got through the system. We started looking at what we could do to keep this from happening again. Implementation of Psychemedics hair testing has been a game- changer, producing a significantly better result and improving the safety of our operations.Senior Director of ComplianceVECTOR [contractor testing] gives companies the flexibility to have their own policies and use testing requirements as they see fit. It gives contractors all the tools they need to manage their drug screen programs, and eliminates the middle person which is a huge cost savings for companies and contractors.Contractor Safety CoordinatorThanks so much for your prompt replies and willingness to discuss the situation at hand. It is not the norm for us to have these types of situations arise, so your support at such a critical time ensures we can keep our business moving forward.Medical Product Supply Leader
School Testimonials

  Universities can educate or enable. As an educator, I strongly believe in drug testing. We need to educate and support our students, while giving them another reason to say no. If drug testing saves one life, it is worth everything. I know firsthand it has. Psychemedics does drug testing the right way and I strongly recommend them to you.Dean of Students at a UniversityDrug testing with Psychemedics was exactly what we needed to arm our students against peer pressure to use drugs. Drug testing shows a commitment to the health of the student and allows students to take responsibility for their choices.Director of Public School SystemThe change I have seen in this fraternity over the past 4 years has truly been incredible. We have transformed our fraternity into a group of men that I am proud to call my brothers, thanks to the drug testing policy.President of College FraternityWe were determined to provide a drug free environment for our students and to arm them with a powerful reason to say no. Psychemedics hair tests has made both possible for 12 years and counting.Dean of Discipline at a High SchoolWe pioneered the use of Psychemedics hair testing in Alabama and we are doing the same thing in Mississippi. It is the deterrent we hoped it would be and it is saving lives every day!Headmaster at Private School

Technology[edit]
Dr. Werner Baumgartner was responsible for founding Psychemedics and spearheading its initial research. A nationally recognized expert on drug testing through hair samples, Dr. Baumgartner gained acclaim by procuring some strands of hair from the 19th-century poet John Keats. Despite the age of the hair, Baumgartner was able to detect that the poet, who died at the age of 26 from tuberculosis, had been taking an increasing amount of opium before his death, most likely used in painkillers. Dr. Baumgartner's find created a minor sensation, enough to warrant a mention in a 1985 Time magazine cover story about drugs in the workplace. [1]
After years of research proved that drugs deposited in the hair can be accurately measured, the company was formed in 1987 and pioneered the use of hair testing in commercial markets including banks, manufacturers, retailers, mining operations, hotels and casinos. The technology capitalizes on the way the body metabolizes ingested drugs as they flow through the blood stream and deposit in the cortex of the hair. Hair is stable and the deposits are permanently embedded in the hair, so hair acts like a tape recorder — “recording” drug deposits in proportion to use over time as drugs are deposited in proportion to use. Hair grows at approximately the rate of ½ an inch per month and takes about 5 days to grow out past the external layer of skin. Psychemedics’ standard test uses a 1 ½ inch sample of head hair, which provides an approximate 3 month history of drug use. Body hair can also be collected if head hair is not available. [2]
Psychemedics hair tests are available in Brazil through the company's independent distributor, Psychemedics Brazil. The partnership goes back over 15 years and the drug tests are provided at clinics throughout Brazil, and then shipped to the lab in Culver City, California for analysis. [3]
Hair testing analyzes the hair shaft, rather than body fluids like urine or saliva, to determine whether illegal drugs are present. Compared to analysis of body fluids, hair testing is highly resistant to evasion by adulterating or substituting samples, or by simply abstaining from drug use for a few days. Though Psychemedics previously used a proprietary radio immunoassay (RIA) method,[4] they have since switched to the industry-standard enzyme immunoassay screening method, which has been successfully employed for years by competitors such as Quest Diagnostics.[5] They use GC/MS/MS or LC/MS/MS confirmation to measure the drug molecules and metabolites within the hair which were incorporated following ingestion.
The Psychemedics technology includes tests for cocaine, marijuana, opiates (including heroin and oxycodone), methamphetamine, Ecstasy (MDMA), Eve (MDEA) and phencyclidine (PCP). A standard test of approximately one-and-one-half inches of head hair cut close to the scalp can provide a several month window to detect drug ingestion.
In 2013, Psychemedics Corporation began offering hair based alcohol Ethyl glucuronide testing. This testing was previously attempted by laboratories in the United Kingdom, but has suffered from numerous lawsuits. Due to the concerns of legal risk, few laboratories offer this type of testing anymore, as they deem it unreliable and unsupportable.[6] The Society of Hair Testing also notes the limitations of EtG, stating that this form of testing can determine "chronic excessive alcohol consumption only. This consensus is not applicable for determination of abstinence from alcohol or moderate consumption of alcohol." SoFT also states that "It is not advisable to use the results of the hair testing for alcohol markers in isolation," supporting the belief that additional testing evidence is required to properly identify an individual's alcohol usage.[7] As such, this form of testing is only applicable for scenarios where severe alcohol abuse is present.
The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has cautioned that the test is "scientifically unsupportable as the sole basis for legal or disciplinary action" because the highly sensitive tests "are not able to distinguish between alcohol absorbed into the body from exposure to many common commercial and household products containing alcohol or from the actual consumption of alcohol."[8]
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not granted FDA clearance to the Psychemedics Corporation for their EtG Alcohol test at this time, which brings the accuracy of this test into question.[9]
Controversies[edit]
In May, 2014, it was announced that The Psychemedics Corporation would be providing hair testing services to three private Cleveland-area schools. Journalists quickly noted a severe conflict of interest, as James Kubacki, Principal of St. Edward's High School, is the brother of Raymond Kubacki, CEO of The Psychemedics Corporation. The Plain Dealer noted that this fact was not disclosed to parents, revealing that it "wasn't stated at the institution-wide meetings to discuss with students their soon-to-be-curtailed privacy."[10]
This is not the first time that The Psychemedics Corporation has been scrutinized for questionable business tactics, having previously hired the high ranking employees of their clients. "Dr. George Elder, a principal for decades, says he instituted drug testing for all students and faculty members at his school. Now he's Psychemedics vice president and pitchman."[11]
Hair Testing History[edit]

1858: Hoppe-Seyler publishes report finding arsenic in the hair in an 11-year old buried body.
1978: Dr. Werner Baumgartner, PhD develops a radioimmunological(RIA)method for detecting drug use from hair specimens.
1987: Psychemedics begins offering services commercially

A standard test of approximately one-and-one-half inches of head hair cut close to the scalp can provide a several month window to detect drug ingestion.
In 2013, Psychemedics Corporation began offering hair based alcohol Ethyl glucuronide testing. This testing was previously attempted by laboratories in the United Kingdom, but has suffered from numerous lawsuits. Due to the concerns of legal risk, few laboratories offer this type of testing anymore, as they deem it unreliable and unsupportable.[6] The Society of Hair Testing also notes the limitations of EtG, stating that this form of testing can determine "chronic excessive alcohol consumption only. This consensus is not applicable for determination of abstinence from alcohol or moderate consumption of alcohol." SoFT also states that "It is not advisable to use the results of the hair testing for alcohol markers in isolation," supporting the belief that additional testing evidence is required to properly identify an individual's alcohol usage.[7] As such, this form of testing is only applicable for scenarios where severe alcohol abuse is present.
The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has cautioned that the test is "scientifically unsupportable as the sole basis for legal or disciplinary action" because the highly sensitive tests "are not able to distinguish between alcohol absorbed into the body from exposure to many common commercial and household products containing alcohol or from the actual consumption of alcohol."[8]
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not granted FDA clearance to the Psychemedics Corporation for their EtG Alcohol test at this time, which brings the accuracy of this test into question.[9]
Controversies[edit]
In May, 2014, it was announced that The Psychemedics Corporation would be providing hair testing services to three private Cleveland-area schools. Journalists quickly noted a severe conflict of interest, as James Kubacki, Principal of St. Edward's High School, is the brother of Raymond Kubacki, CEO of The Psychemedics Corporation. The Plain Dealer noted that this fact was not disclosed to parents, revealing that it "wasn't stated at the institution-wide meetings to discuss with students their soon-to-be-curtailed privacy."[10]
This is not the first time that The Psychemedics Corporation has been scrutinized for questionable business tactics, having previously hired the high ranking employees of their clients. "Dr. George Elder, a principal for decades, says he instituted drug testing for all students and faculty members at his school. Now he's Psychemedics vice president and pitchman."[11]
Hair Testing History[edit]

1858: Hoppe-Seyler publishes report finding arsenic in the hair in an 11-year old buried body.
1978: Dr. Werner Baumgartner, PhD develops a radioimmunological(RIA)method for detecting drug use from hair specimens.
1987: Psychemedics begins offering services commercially
