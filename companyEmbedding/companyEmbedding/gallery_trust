Gallery works!
I started using Gallery last spring and I was almost completely weed free. Definitely better than the scotts weed n feed stuff. Gallery didn't turn any grass yellow either, the scotts one did so I'm giving it a good review because it does what it says.

Broadleaf control with gallery
This product is much easier to apply to my lawn (around 12,000 sq ft) because the fertilome brand gallery was half the size and needed almost 6 bags. 3 bags of this gallery had more than enough coverage for my entire lawn.

Weed Control
Gallery is the best broadleaf specific weed control I have used. If there's lots of rain in the spring and summer, it's best to apply a second application in the summer to ensure proper control. This bag covers more area than other ones I used in the past.

Q: Can I use the broadleaf weed control  together with the turf trust fertilizer ? 
When to apply I live in the northeast ?


								Asked by: Joseph 



								- 3/16/2014
							


A: You can use the Broadleaf Weed Control with Turf Trust Fertilizer. You can apply them both when all the snow is melted and temperatures are in the 50's and 60's. Depending on where in the North East you are located it may be in late March or early April.

Q: When I received the bag of Broadleaf Weed Control with Gallery I couldn't find directions for applying.  My question do I need to water in after applying or does it have to be dry for 24 hours after applying? 


								Asked by: Tom



								- 4/7/2014
							


A: Broadleaf Weed Control with Gallery should be watered in after applying it. If you can time it before a rain, that would be best for it.

Q: I purchased Turf Trust Broadleaf Weed Control with Gallery and also Crabgrass Preventer with Dimension.  In the spring, should I apply each at separate times for maximum effectiveness and if so, how far apart ?  Which one do you recommend I apply first? Thank you for your help.


								Asked by: Len



								- 10/14/2014
							


A: Gallery should be applied first, when the ground is not frozen. This is usually done in March when broadleaf weeds are first germinating. Dimension is applied later, usually in mid-late April when temperatures are in the 60's consistently.

								Asked by: Al Rickard



								- 3/3/2016
							


A: You will probably use a setting of 5 or 6 for the best coverage, but it is best to see which setting opens your spreader slot at around 1/3".

Q: I applied this product about the third week in March and I now see areas where chickweed is coming up. I live near Annapolis,MD. Any suggestions would be appreciated?


								Asked by: Russell Ellis



								- 4/6/2014
							


A: The chickweed most likely dropped its seed and germinated in the Fall and started growing during the warm peaks through March and April and is now noticeable. You can spray those weeds dead with Speed Zone. Once you spray those existing weeds dead, you will get a good sense of whether or not you are having additional weeds germinate or not.

Q: Is it acceptable to apply your Gallery product in late fall for early spring growth?  Also, will I need your Demension product in addition to the Gallery for crab grass control.  I am a north central Minnesota residence and the crab grass is prolific in late Aug. into Sept.   My thought is to get the Gallery on in fall and do the Demension in late May or early June. ?? What do you recommend? tks.



								Asked by: Allyn



								- 10/7/2015
							


A: You can apply Gallery in late Fall to prevent early Spring weeds. Usually these weeds will germinate in late Fall but are too small to notice till Spring, so applying Gallery now will keep those weeds under control. Crabgrass Control w/ Dimension is better to use in early Fall rather than late Fall. Use Dimension in late spring or early summer. If you don't need to seed next fall, you can use Dimension again in August to ensure crabgrass does not germinate.

Q: What damage to lawn or bushes using too much Gallery  ?


								Asked by: George



								- 3/8/2016
							


A: Gallery can cause browning of shrubs if too much is applied in its near vicinity. It will typically not cause harm to your lawn unless you spread a lot of it into concentrated areas. You should always keep a barrier from trees and shrubs when using Gallery.

Q: which should be put down first-Pro Trust Crabgrass preventer with dimension or Weed preventer with Gallery?  Or can I put them down together?


								Asked by: Jeanne



								- 3/14/2016
							


A: Gallery should go down first because it will prevent the popular weeds that are emerging now. Dimension should be applied in mid-late Spring to prevent crabgrass and other grassy weeds. The products don't technically need to be spaced out with a certain amount of time.

Q: My lawn has been particularly vulnerable to lawn disease and fungus in the hot steamy summer months-- I use a variety of fungicides, and that helps.  I fertilize in the fall.... believing that fertilizing in the spring aggravates the problem.   I have modest  broadleaf weed problems along with some modest crab grass issues.  Controlling weeds and crabgrass, therefore, will be my main focus in these early months.  Which do you think is best for me--Your "Crabgrass Control with Dimension" or your "Broadleaf Weed Control With Gallery?)   In the past, I've just used a spot weed control.... but they're starting to get the better of me.  Still, neither the weeds nor the crabgrass is exactly taking over my lawn.

Welcome your guidance


								Asked by: Tim



								- 3/22/2016
							


A: For maximum effectiveness, you should use Broadleaf Weed Control and Crabgrass Control. The combination of the two will cover all the weeds during the spring and summer. You will benefit greatly from a liquid mycorrhizae application once a month starting in March. This will help your lawns root system and make it more disease resistant.

Artist


Jennifer Hannaford is a forensic scientist and an emerging contemporary artist based in New York City. Her underwater series demonstrates a fantastically refreshing new talent – marrying superb technical drawing and painting skills, with her profound understanding of the human form.
In an effort to get in touch with her innate artistic side, Jennifer began her art career with a series of mug shots created entirely with her own finger prints. She recently expanded her subject matter and style to include the underwater series.
As a forensic scientist, Hannaford experienced some of the harsher realities of human nature.  Her art allows her to explore beautiful moments of the living experience frozen in time on canvas; life, ascension, and balance. Using sensibilities that were born out of her professional training in forensic science, she understands how the body feels and reacts underwater. When we look at her representational work – we can easily relate it to our own life experiences.
Born in Placerville, California in 1968, Jennifer Hannaford received a Bachelor of Forensic Science from California State University of Sacramento in 1994, and a Masters in Biomedical Forensic Science from Boston University in 2013. As a result of her studies, Jennifer understood that recovered latent fingerprints could potentially be used for the purpose of art authentication. Fascinated by this combination of art and science, her thesis focused on the recovery of fingerprint detail from the imprimatura (foundational) layer in paintings. Hannaford continues to explore this unique science while she pursues a full time painting career.
Adelman Fine Art is pleased to represent Jennifer Hannaford and share her talent with collectors worldwide.
AFA: Your artist career began by creating celebrity mug shots using your own fingerprints. Tell us about what motivated you to explore painting with oils in your Underwater Series.

Jen: “Painting in oils was always a goal of mine. I was teaching my niece to swim about twenty years ago.  Watching her underwater with bubbles and weightlessness was a moment I wanted to capture on canvas, in color. Five years ago, I jumped in to some weekend classes when I moved to NYC. I have poured myself into the pursuit and developed this series over the past few years.”


 
AFA: Do you foresee another evolution in your art style or subject matter?

Jen: “Oh yes!  What that is, I cannot entirely picture yet. I think that will evolve and I welcome the journey. My hope is to take advantage of the many wonderful instructors in the city, view the art that hangs on our museum walls, and continue to develop a style uniquely mine.
I want to develop a style such that when someone looks at my work, whether it is a painting of a jelly donut or a portrait, the viewer knows, ‘That is a Jenny Hannaford!.’  I want that ‘thing’ that is all my own!  That takes growth, a lot of paint, and many hours. I am still at the beginning of that, and that is the fun part.”


 
AFA: Tell us about one of the most interesting forensic cases you’ve worked on…

Jen: “I usually do not talk too much about specific cases out of respect for family and victims. Yet some of my favorite cases have been cold cases reopened and solved by forensic examiners armed with new technology. One tool is our Automatic Biometric Identification System which houses the known fingerprints of individuals.  Evidence prints can be searched against this database with identifications returned in cases where suspects are not known.
To speak of the power of fingerprints and some cases in general, there are cases that have involved identical male twin and sexual assault (I actually worked one). The recovered DNA profile can be typed, but one cannot say which twin is the perpetrator because they share the same DNA.  At least it cannot be differentiated through our forensic typing methods.  However, even identical twins have different fingerprints.  We all do.  Even though the DNA might lead an investigator in the right direction, it has been left to fingerprint comparisons (if they are at the scene) to identify the proper suspect.”


 
AFA: If you could trade places with any other person for a week, famous or not, living or dead, real or fictional, with whom would it be?

Jen: “Oh too hard.  Too many people.  If I could just for a week walk in the shoes of some of our civil rights heroes and know their courage and conviction while facing so many challenges. That would be something.
I cannot choose just one, so for now I will choose an artist.  Henrik Uldalen.  When I look at his art, my heart…it just beats faster.  His live painting demonstrations are what I would imagine a beautiful piece of music looks like.
And if I am Uldalen for only a week, that guy better be busy in the studio!  I want to soak up all that knowledge and let work it through my own fingers when I get home!”


 
AFA: What song best describes your work ethic?

Jen: “For so many reasons- John Denver’s ‘The Eagle and the Hawk.'”


 
AFA: What happened in your last dream?

Jen: “It was awful.  I had a dream last night that I was in a production where I had to get up on stage and sing, by myself.  I was terrified.  I woke up right before I got on stage.  I would rather have the dream where I am followed by snakes.  Way less scary.

I hate public speaking!  And singing in public, alone?  Forget about it.”


 
AFA: In keeping with our current exhibition…where is your favorite place to swim or enjoy water? 

Jen: “I was fortunate enough to be able to spend time in Queensland, Australia, snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef. It was better than any theme park!  In fact, some of those visions may show up in my art one day.”


 
AFA: Who is the most famous painter whose work you have performed or analyzed the forensics?

Jen: “These cases are few and far between. Yet, I have seen some cool things! I am currently working on a potential Picasso. The challenges of art authentication through friction ridge detail work lies in the procurement of known prints (from the artist) to compare the “unknown” print from the piece of art under examination.  That often leads one on a trail to examine other known works of art that may contain fingerprints of that particular artist.”

 
AFA: You use photography as a reference for your paintings. Please tell us about this process and any interesting stories about photo shoots.
Jen: “My nephew, Miles Hannaford, is a professional photographer and has taken most of my reference photographs for me.  He has done such a wonderful job.  Out of thousands of shots sometimes you find only a handful that captures a moment that I may want to translate into a painting. My models are family and friends.  While many of these painted scenes are quite relaxed, these wonderful people are often in the pool for hours. It is a lot of fun, but they work hard!

Electronic paper, or e-paper is making great technological advances, but what exactly is it and how does it work?
Electronic paper is also known as e-paper and is a technology designed to imitate the look and style of ordinary ink and paper. E-paper reflects light just as ordinary paper does, unlike the usual flat-panel display that is lit with a backlight to illuminate pixels.
Electronic paper was first developed in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 20 and 100 micrometres across.
E-paper comprises two different parts: the first is electronic ink, sometimes referred to as the "frontplane"; and the second is the electronics required to generate the pattern of text and images on the e-ink page, called the "backplane".Several different technologies are involved in the production of e-paper, some use plastic substrate and electronics to make the display flexible, this makes it more comfortable to read that traditional displays and gives it a stable image, so you don't have to refresh it constantly. Though it's light and durable the color representation is still somewhat limited.There are several uses of electronic paper that can be seen or even purchased today. Here are some examples:Lucent's new E Ink device shows how the future of ePaper is coming. The technology uses electronic ink and combines thin, plastic, flexible transistors with polymer LEDs to create smart pixels. The process involved uses silicon rubber stamps to print minute computer circuits onto the surface. For display, E Ink uses electronic ink: a liquid plastic substance made up of millions of tiny capsules filled with light and dark dyes that change color when exposed to an electric charge. This device will be completely flexible like paper (without the easy tearing or crumpling) and can display changing text or image.The benefits to using electronic paper are quite impressive. Here are some of the benefits of using the technology:

The Federal government Trade Commission, the country's consumer protection company, has some tips to obtain the most for your cash.
Check around. A "sale" price isn't always the "best" price. Some merchants may give you a sale price on an item for a limited time; others may discount the purchase price on a single item everyday. Having an item's manufacturer, model number, and other identifying information can help you to get the best price for that you want.Read sale advertising carefully. Some may say "quantities limited," "no rainfall bank checks," or "unavailable whatsoever stores." Before you come out the door, call ahead to be sure the merchant has the item in stock. If you're searching for a favorite or hard-to-find item, ask the merchant if he'd be willing to carry that until you can reach the store.

Description
The Trust, 24″ x 18″, oil on panel, framed by the artist
Another addition to The Quench Project. The Trust asks the question, “can we trust the water that we drink?” This is a question we in America never thought we’d have to ask. The sweet, trusting continence of Antoinette’s expression and pose, AND that she is obviously pregnant, causes us to wonder if our water is actually fresh. Incredibly, we can no longer take for granted that the water out of our faucet will be safe. The Trust is a call to action.
My model for this work, Antoinette, was our delightful house guest from Rwanda. She graciously agreed to pose for this painting in support of the mission behind The Quench Project.
Antoinette was here to bring her twin boys safely into the world. Conditions in her country make having twins a very risky proposition. So Sarah Hipp made it part of her Christian mission to bring her here and saw to it that she receive top medical care. Thanks to the St Andrews clinic for providing excellent care.  Her beautiful twins were born in early August and are doing great.

Trust



From nightmares to daydreams, from arrows to nightingales
a jasmine garden performs for your loneliness.
Confused by the tears of aroma rare radiance surrenders.
Your drained eyes still sing and still learn how to wonder.
In the rolling hills of fragrance amongst the red-painted bridges
you learn how to lay your head on a stranger’s shoulder.
