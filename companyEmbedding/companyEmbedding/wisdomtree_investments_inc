Company information[edit]
WisdomTree believes that its differentiated approach, employing a distinctive index-based methodology, delivers better risk adjusted returns over the long term.[11] The company’s index-based funds employ a fundamental weighted investment methodology, which weights securities on the basis of factors such as dividends or earnings, whereas most other ETF indexes use a capitalization weighted methodology.[12]
WisdomTree offers 14 different actively managed ETFs, which are ETFs that are not based on a particular index but rather are actively managed with complete transparency into the ETF’s portfolio on a daily basis.[13] WisdomTree's exemptive relief enables the company to use its own indexes for certain ETFs, actively manage other ETFs and incorporate the use of derivatives in certain products, thereby allowing the company to develop certain ETFs not yet offered by other sponsors.[12]
History[edit]
WisdomTree Investments, Inc. was incorporated by its Chief Executive Officer and founder, Jonathan Steinberg, in Delaware as Financial Data Systems, Inc., on September 19, 1985, but was inactive until October 1988 when it acquired the assets relating to what would become Individual Investor magazine, a monthly personal finance magazine.[1]
In December 1991, it completed an initial public offering and commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In 1993, the company’s name was changed to Individual Investor Group, Inc. and throughout the 1990s it was a financial media company that published several magazines, including Individual Investor and Ticker, newsletters, as well as maintained several online financial related websites. In addition, the company also began developing stock indexes.[1]
Due to the economic downturn in the financial media industry in 2000 and 2001, the company sold its media properties in order to preserve its capital while it pursued a new business plan focusing on developing and licensing its stock indexes. The company’s common stock was de-listed from Nasdaq and began quotation on the over-the-counter market.[1]
In 2002, the company’s name was changed to Index Development Partners, Inc., and Jonathan Steinberg, along with Luciano Siracusano, currently Executive Vice President – Head of Sales & Chief Investment Strategist, continued development of the concepts for the company’s fundamentally weighted index methodology. While this concept was being developed, the company sought to obtain financing to recapitalize and become an ETF sponsor.[1][4]
Between 2004 and 2005, the company obtained financing from a core group of investors including former hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, Professor Jeremy Siegel of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and James D Robinson IV with venture capital firm of RRE Ventures. Michael Steinhardt became Chairman and Professor Jeremy Siegel became the senior investment strategy advisor for the company.[1]
On September 21, 2005, the company’s name was changed to WisdomTree Investments, Inc.[14] WisdomTree Investments, Inc. launched its first 20 ETFs in June 2006.[5] On July 26, 2011, WisdomTree listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker: WETF.[4][9]

Company information[edit]
WisdomTree believes that its differentiated approach, employing a distinctive index-based methodology, delivers better risk adjusted returns over the long term.[11] The company’s index-based funds employ a fundamental weighted investment methodology, which weights securities on the basis of factors such as dividends or earnings, whereas most other ETF indexes use a capitalization weighted methodology.[12]
WisdomTree offers 14 different actively managed ETFs, which are ETFs that are not based on a particular index but rather are actively managed with complete transparency into the ETF’s portfolio on a daily basis.[13] WisdomTree's exemptive relief enables the company to use its own indexes for certain ETFs, actively manage other ETFs and incorporate the use of derivatives in certain products, thereby allowing the company to develop certain ETFs not yet offered by other sponsors.[12]
History[edit]
WisdomTree Investments, Inc. was incorporated by its Chief Executive Officer and founder, Jonathan Steinberg, in Delaware as Financial Data Systems, Inc., on September 19, 1985, but was inactive until October 1988 when it acquired the assets relating to what would become Individual Investor magazine, a monthly personal finance magazine.[1]
In December 1991, it completed an initial public offering and commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In 1993, the company’s name was changed to Individual Investor Group, Inc. and throughout the 1990s it was a financial media company that published several magazines, including Individual Investor and Ticker, newsletters, as well as maintained several online financial related websites. In addition, the company also began developing stock indexes.[1]
Due to the economic downturn in the financial media industry in 2000 and 2001, the company sold its media properties in order to preserve its capital while it pursued a new business plan focusing on developing and licensing its stock indexes. The company’s common stock was de-listed from Nasdaq and began quotation on the over-the-counter market.[1]
In 2002, the company’s name was changed to Index Development Partners, Inc., and Jonathan Steinberg, along with Luciano Siracusano, currently Executive Vice President – Head of Sales & Chief Investment Strategist, continued development of the concepts for the company’s fundamentally weighted index methodology. While this concept was being developed, the company sought to obtain financing to recapitalize and become an ETF sponsor.[1][4]
Between 2004 and 2005, the company obtained financing from a core group of investors including former hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, Professor Jeremy Siegel of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and James D Robinson IV with venture capital firm of RRE Ventures. Michael Steinhardt became Chairman and Professor Jeremy Siegel became the senior investment strategy advisor for the company.[1]
On September 21, 2005, the company’s name was changed to WisdomTree Investments, Inc.[14] WisdomTree Investments, Inc. launched its first 20 ETFs in June 2006.[5] On July 26, 2011, WisdomTree listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker: WETF.[4][9]

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

WisdomTree Investments, Inc. (NASDAQ: WETF) is a New York-based exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) and exchange-traded product ("ETP") sponsor and asset manager. WisdomTree launched its first ETFs in June 2006, and is currently the industry’s fifth largest ETF provider in the United States.[4][5] WisdomTree sponsors 92 distinct ETFs that span asset classes and countries around the world. Categories include: U.S. and International Equity, Currency, Fixed Income and Alternatives. WisdomTree's largest ETF in terms of AUM is the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund NYSE: HEDJ, which had over $20.39 billion on December 28, 2015. The ETFs invests in European equities but hedges out currency risks due to the changing exchange rates between the US Dollar and the euro.[6][7] WisdomTree was one of the pioneers for the concept of fundamentally weighted ETFs and active ETFs and is currently an industry leader in both categories.[4][8] WisdomTree is the only publicly traded asset manager exclusively focused on the ETP industry. WisdomTree manages approximately $44.5 billion in ETF assets under management, as of February 23, 2016.[2]
The WisdomTree common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker: NASDAQ: WETF.[4][9] In 2014, WisdomTree acquired a majority stake (75%) in London-based Boost ETP. WisdomTree will invest $20 million in Boost to give it working capital to build out its European business.[10]

Company information[edit]
WisdomTree believes that its differentiated approach, employing a distinctive index-based methodology, delivers better risk adjusted returns over the long term.[11] The company’s index-based funds employ a fundamental weighted investment methodology, which weights securities on the basis of factors such as dividends or earnings, whereas most other ETF indexes use a capitalization weighted methodology.[12]
WisdomTree offers 14 different actively managed ETFs, which are ETFs that are not based on a particular index but rather are actively managed with complete transparency into the ETF’s portfolio on a daily basis.[13] WisdomTree's exemptive relief enables the company to use its own indexes for certain ETFs, actively manage other ETFs and incorporate the use of derivatives in certain products, thereby allowing the company to develop certain ETFs not yet offered by other sponsors.[12]
History[edit]
WisdomTree Investments, Inc. was incorporated by its Chief Executive Officer and founder, Jonathan Steinberg, in Delaware as Financial Data Systems, Inc., on September 19, 1985, but was inactive until October 1988 when it acquired the assets relating to what would become Individual Investor magazine, a monthly personal finance magazine.[1]
In December 1991, it completed an initial public offering and commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In 1993, the company’s name was changed to Individual Investor Group, Inc. and throughout the 1990s it was a financial media company that published several magazines, including Individual Investor and Ticker, newsletters, as well as maintained several online financial related websites. In addition, the company also began developing stock indexes.[1]
Due to the economic downturn in the financial media industry in 2000 and 2001, the company sold its media properties in order to preserve its capital while it pursued a new business plan focusing on developing and licensing its stock indexes. The company’s common stock was de-listed from Nasdaq and began quotation on the over-the-counter market.[1]
In 2002, the company’s name was changed to Index Development Partners, Inc., and Jonathan Steinberg, along with Luciano Siracusano, currently Executive Vice President – Head of Sales & Chief Investment Strategist, continued development of the concepts for the company’s fundamentally weighted index methodology. While this concept was being developed, the company sought to obtain financing to recapitalize and become an ETF sponsor.[1][4]
Between 2004 and 2005, the company obtained financing from a core group of investors including former hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, Professor Jeremy Siegel of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and James D Robinson IV with venture capital firm of RRE Ventures. Michael Steinhardt became Chairman and Professor Jeremy Siegel became the senior investment strategy advisor for the company.[1]
On September 21, 2005, the company’s name was changed to WisdomTree Investments, Inc.[14] WisdomTree Investments, Inc. launched its first 20 ETFs in June 2006.[5] On July 26, 2011, WisdomTree listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker: WETF.[4][9]

WisdomTree Investments, Inc. (NASDAQ: WETF) is a New York-based exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) and exchange-traded product ("ETP") sponsor and asset manager. WisdomTree launched its first ETFs in June 2006, and is currently the industry’s fifth largest ETF provider in the United States.[4][5] WisdomTree sponsors 92 distinct ETFs that span asset classes and countries around the world. Categories include: U.S. and International Equity, Currency, Fixed Income and Alternatives. WisdomTree's largest ETF in terms of AUM is the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund NYSE: HEDJ, which had over $20.39 billion on December 28, 2015. The ETFs invests in European equities but hedges out currency risks due to the changing exchange rates between the US Dollar and the euro.[6][7] WisdomTree was one of the pioneers for the concept of fundamentally weighted ETFs and active ETFs and is currently an industry leader in both categories.[4][8] WisdomTree is the only publicly traded asset manager exclusively focused on the ETP industry. WisdomTree manages approximately $44.5 billion in ETF assets under management, as of February 23, 2016.[2]
The WisdomTree common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker: NASDAQ: WETF.[4][9] In 2014, WisdomTree acquired a majority stake (75%) in London-based Boost ETP. WisdomTree will invest $20 million in Boost to give it working capital to build out its European business.[10]

Company information[edit]
WisdomTree believes that its differentiated approach, employing a distinctive index-based methodology, delivers better risk adjusted returns over the long term.[11] The company’s index-based funds employ a fundamental weighted investment methodology, which weights securities on the basis of factors such as dividends or earnings, whereas most other ETF indexes use a capitalization weighted methodology.[12]
WisdomTree offers 14 different actively managed ETFs, which are ETFs that are not based on a particular index but rather are actively managed with complete transparency into the ETF’s portfolio on a daily basis.[13] WisdomTree's exemptive relief enables the company to use its own indexes for certain ETFs, actively manage other ETFs and incorporate the use of derivatives in certain products, thereby allowing the company to develop certain ETFs not yet offered by other sponsors.[12]
History[edit]
WisdomTree Investments, Inc. was incorporated by its Chief Executive Officer and founder, Jonathan Steinberg, in Delaware as Financial Data Systems, Inc., on September 19, 1985, but was inactive until October 1988 when it acquired the assets relating to what would become Individual Investor magazine, a monthly personal finance magazine.[1]
In December 1991, it completed an initial public offering and commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In 1993, the company’s name was changed to Individual Investor Group, Inc. and throughout the 1990s it was a financial media company that published several magazines, including Individual Investor and Ticker, newsletters, as well as maintained several online financial related websites. In addition, the company also began developing stock indexes.[1]
Due to the economic downturn in the financial media industry in 2000 and 2001, the company sold its media properties in order to preserve its capital while it pursued a new business plan focusing on developing and licensing its stock indexes. The company’s common stock was de-listed from Nasdaq and began quotation on the over-the-counter market.[1]
In 2002, the company’s name was changed to Index Development Partners, Inc., and Jonathan Steinberg, along with Luciano Siracusano, currently Executive Vice President – Head of Sales & Chief Investment Strategist, continued development of the concepts for the company’s fundamentally weighted index methodology. While this concept was being developed, the company sought to obtain financing to recapitalize and become an ETF sponsor.[1][4]
Between 2004 and 2005, the company obtained financing from a core group of investors including former hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, Professor Jeremy Siegel of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and James D Robinson IV with venture capital firm of RRE Ventures. Michael Steinhardt became Chairman and Professor Jeremy Siegel became the senior investment strategy advisor for the company.[1]
On September 21, 2005, the company’s name was changed to WisdomTree Investments, Inc.[14] WisdomTree Investments, Inc. launched its first 20 ETFs in June 2006.[5] On July 26, 2011, WisdomTree listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker: WETF.[4][9]

* Fund Inception Date 06/16/2006






Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance data for the most recent month-end is available above.
 
WisdomTree shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00pm net asset value (NAV). Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.
 
After-Tax Held Returns represent return on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and assumes Fund shares have not been sold. After-Tax Sold Returns represent returns on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and the sale of the Fund shares.
 
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's individual tax rates and may differ from those shown.
 
In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of fund shares at the end of the measurement period.

Why WisdomTree Investments, Inc. Stock Dropped Today
Here's why the ETF manager's stock dropped more than 11% today.











                Jordan Wathen
            

                (TMFValueMagnet)



            
            Dec 3, 2015 at 3:21PM
            
            






What: Shares of WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF) were down more than 11% on Thursday at 2:30 p.m. EST as the U.S. Dollar Index took a dive.
So what: WisdomTree's most popular and profitable products are its hedged currency ETFs for foreign stocks. Its international hedged equity strategies made up $34.6 billion of its $53 billion in total assets under management at the end of the third quarter.
These ETFs seek to track changes in foreign stocks while hedging out the changes in the value of the U.S. dollar. Thus, if you wanted to get the returns of Japanese stocks without any currency impact resulting from the value of the dollar against the yen, you might invest in its WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (NYSEMKT:DXJ), which tracks the returns of Japanese stocks excluding currency fluctuations.
Hedged ETFs generally beat unhedged indexes when the U.S. dollar is rising in value, and lag the underlying unhedged index when the dollar falls in value.
Now what: The U.S. Dollar is on the move, falling about 2.3% against a basket of currencies as of 2:30 p.m. EST. When the dollar falls, hedged ETFs become less attractive to investors, and generally result in lower returns for hedged ETFs, and less AUM for WisdomTree.





The European Central Bank's decision to cut short-term rates to -0.3% vs. expectations for a cut to -0.4% led to a weakening dollar against the euro. Notably, the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (NYSEMKT:HEDJ) was down about 4.3% at 2:30 p.m. EST.
These daily swings shouldn't matter very much to the long-term investor, however. What's most important is that investors generally like hedged products, and that WisdomTree continues to hold onto the leading position in the niche, two things that are as true today as they have been over time.
