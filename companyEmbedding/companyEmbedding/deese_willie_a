A HISTORY OF THE EARNEST GRANT DEESE AND WILLIE DELL DEESE FAMILY
By W. T.Block

Earnest Grant Deese was born in in Alabama on October 6, 1906. His
father, John Wesley Deese, and his mother, Mary Ann Grant Deese, owned turpentine stills,
land, and a general mercantile store in extreme south central Alabama (Covington and
Coffee counties). John W. Deese, who grew up an orphan on the frontier, had no opportunity
to attend school as a boy, and eventually he employed many people, both Blacks and Whites,
in his business enterprises. Because he had to depend on a ruthless bookkeeper to
administer his finances, John Deese suffered heavily from embezzlement, the bookkeeper
stealing from his employer.
One family tradition held that, when race troubles developed in John
Deese' neighborhood, a hard-working, kind Negro, whom Deese knew to be innocent of any
wrong doing, was being hunted by a lynch mob. Deese gave the black man food and money, and
then dipped his shoes in turpentine so the blood hounds could not track him. The Negro
made good his escape.
In 1913, Earnest Deese' parents sold their store, land, and dwellings
in Alabama, and then moved by train with their furniture, livestock, equipment, and
married children to Carriere, Pearl River County, Mississippi. Being unable to lease or
buy timber lands in that area of Mississippi, the Deese family were soon reduced to
share-cropping. One by one, the remaining children left home, until only Earnest was left
to plow the fields, and care for the livestock as well as his aging parents. Because of
that, he could only go to school a half-day at a time, but he nevertheless succeeded in
finishing the eleventh and twelfth grades in one year. For a while, he worked in a nursery
for ten cents an hour until he saved enough money to enter and graduate from Soule
Business College in New Orleans, where he studied bookkeeping and banking. 
On August 2, 1931, Earnest Deese married Willie Dell Watson of McNeill,
Mississippi, the daughter of David Hubert Watson and Emeline Spiers. Eventually, the D. H.
Watson family would also move to Nederland, Texas, where they resided at 904 Helena for
many years prior to their deaths. The year 1931 was not particularly a good year to marry
and start a family anywhere in this country, it being in the utter depths of the Great
Depression, but especially so in South Mississippi. Most jobs there were only temporary,
lasting perhaps a few weeks, and many men had to go out of state to seek employment.
Earnest Deese worked for a while as bookkeeper for Wiggins Pickling Company. Later he
worked for the W. P. A. (Works Progress Administration, a Federal agency under Pres.
Roosevelt), first as a weigher, building roads, and later as a bookkeeper. Willie Dell
Deese also worked for W. P. A., at first in the sewing room; later for the County Home
Demonstration Agency, teaching food preservation; and eventually as a land assessor.
Earnest Deese first came to Texas in 1934, where his first work was in
an oil field, and where he also caught malaria. By then, their oldest child, Jeanne Marie
Deese was two years old. While Earnest was recuperating, Willie Dell picked cotton and did
other farm chores to help support the family. Their second trip to Texas ended up for a
time in Richmond, southwest of Houston, where Earnest caught malaria fever again, and
Winnie Dell worked as a waitress at Green's Cafe. When Earnest was able to travel, the
Deese family caught the train back to Carriere, Mississippi. After buying a second-hand
car, they traveled through Florida to work the fruit harvest, even though Willie Dell was
pregnant. For a time Willie Dell worked as a packer in a grapefruit plant, while Earnest
worked as an operator and custodian in a fruit juice canning plant. Finally, Earnest got a
part-time job at the box factory in Picayune, Mississippi, about the time that daughter
Patricia Anne was born at the Picayune hospital. 
In June, 1936, Earnest decided to hitchhike back to Texas, and although
Willie Dell was pregnant again, she got a job in a shirt factory as a labeler. On this
trip, Earnest ended up in Nederland, Texas, where he stayed with Willie Dell's cousin,
Myrtle and Morris Green. 
Earnest Deese got a temporary job, working "shutdowns" at
Pure Oil Company (now Unocal) for only three days a month, but he was earning 65 cents an
hour while he worked. That wage seemed fabulous, compared to wages being paid in
Mississippi, so Willie Dell loaded up her two children into her Model A Ford and set out
for Nederland in August, 1937. Fifteen hours later, she arrived with only fifty cents left
in her purse. 
The couple rented their first house in Nederland for $5.00 a month at
1007 Boston, next door to Twin City Tabernacle, where they also attended church for the
next several years. In November, 1937, their third child, Billy Grant Deese, was born, and
in the meantime they moved to another rent house three doors away, also in the 1000 block
of Boston. At one time they lived at the corner of 11th Street and Franklin. Earnest was
still working shutdowns, and Willie Dell took in washing, ironing, and sewing from the
public, even though her three infants and toddlers kept her tied to her home. 
In 1941, their youngest child, Jack Drexel Deese, was born. At that
time, Earnest Deese was working in th oil field at Tomball, Texas, when he came home with
double pneumonia. After two months of illness, he enrolled at Lamar College, in technical
arts classes that were designed to train him as a journeyman pipe fitter. Willie Dell
became a Sunday School teacher at Twin City Tabernacle, and later, music director, working
with young people. She also had a radio program in progress, offered for a young people's
singing group. She had a mixed quartet, and finally an all girls' quartet. Willie Dell
wrote the theme song for a group called the Sunshine Gospel Singers, both lyrics and
music, which have been edited. 
In 1945 Earnest Deese went to work for Neches Butane Products Company
as a first-class pipe fitter, and after twenty years service there, he retired with total
disability in 1965. During 1946-1947, Earnest and Willie Dell were co-owners of Deese'
Garage on Nederland Avenue.
In 1950, Willie Dell Deese attended St. Mary's Hospital and Lamar
College Nursing Schools and graduated in 1952 with her nursing license. She was a surgical
nurse for a few months and then started working for Physicians' Clinic for the next twenty
years. After that, she worked for Beaumont and Port Arthur Home Health Service for two
years until an auto accident left her unable to work for one year. After recuperating, she
worked for Gaspard's Nursing Care Center in Port Acres, until she retired in 1989 due to
her husband's failing health. 
Willie Dell Deese became a charter member of the Pilot Club of
Midcounty in 1960, and is still a member of that club in good standing. In 1971, 1972, and
1973, she was on the Citizens' City Council Coordinator of Public Buildings, and was on
the steering committee when the new Police Station was started, as well as the Doornbos
Civic Building. In 1969, as a Pilot Club member, Willie Dell donated one of her hand-made
quilts to be raffled off to help raise sufficient funds to build the Dutch Windmill
Museum. 
Willie Dell also cared for a group of elderly people, checking their
blood pressures, etc. She also helped them with projects, became an avid quilter, and
belonged to the Super-60s group of Port Neches, where she still takes blood pressures for
the elderly once a month, keeps records, and makes physician recommendations when needed.
She also taught crafts to the residents of Gaspard's Nursing Home for many years. 
About thirty years ago, Earnest and Willie Dell Deese built their
present home at 1123 South Fourteenth Street, where they have resided for most of their
lives in Nederland. 
The Deese family is also proud that all four of their children are
graduates of Nederland High School; also five of their grandchildren, the others having
graduated from high schools elsewhere. They are also proud that all of their children,
their spouses, and most of their grandchildren have attended Lamar University. 
Between 1960-1966, the Deese family members owned and operated the
Jiffy Food Store at Twin City and Nederland Avenue, as well as the Jiffy Food Store in
Port Arthur in 1965. Willie Dell and her daughter, Jeanne Marie, also owned Marguerite's
Beauty Shop in Nederland from 1974 until 1977. 
For many years now, the Deese family have been members of First United
Methodist Church of Nederland.
Daughter Jeanne Marie Deese is a graduate in Education of Lamar
University and by profession a teacher. She is a member of Port Neches Chapter of the
Order of Eastern Star and is a Past Worthy Matron. She married (1) Jude L. McBride, and
(2) Dr. Charles P. McGuire. She is the mother of five daughters and seven grandchildren.
She and her family are members of First Methodist Church in Friendswood. 
Daughter Patricia Ann Deese is also a graduate of Lamar University and
is by profession a teacher. She too is a member of the Port Neches Chapter of the Order of
Eastern Star, is a Past Worthy Matron, as well as a former Grand Officer. Patricia Ann
married (1) Hestel G. Sheffield, and (2) Charles L. Edwards. She is the mother of one son
and three daughters and has eight grandchildren. She and her husband are members of First
United Methodist Church in Port Neches. 
Son Billy Grant Deese attended Lamar College and has been a Nederland
postal employee for 32 years. Billy is the father of two sons by different marriages, and
he has two granddaughters. (Ed.'s Note: The editor hired Billy Deese in the Nederland post
office in 1959.)
Son Jack Drexel Deese also attended Lamar, and he is an electrician by
trade. Jack served in the U. S. Marine Corps, the U. S. Army, and the U. S. National
Guard. He married Marie Linda Toups, and they are the parents of one son and one daughter.
Jack and his wife are members of First Baptist Church in Nederland. 
Earnest and Willie Dell Deese are proud of their more than fifty years
of residence in Nederland and found it to be a good place to raise their family. They are
equally proud that they and their children have been able to contribute through their
civic, educational and religious activities toward the improvement of their city.

Merck Names Sanat Chattopadhyay President of Merck Manufacturing 
      Division; Will Succeed Willie A. Deese Who Will Retire






March 07, 2016 04:30 PM Eastern Standard Time



KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, 
      today announced the appointment of Sanat Chattopadhyay as executive vice 
      president and president, Merck Manufacturing Division (MMD), effective 
      April 1, 2016. Chattopadhyay will succeed Willie A. Deese who will 
      retire on June 1, 2016 after 12 years with the company.
    


      “With more than 30 years of biopharmaceutical industry experience, Sanat 
      has a proven track record of commercialization, manufacturing and supply 
      chain excellence in therapeutic proteins, vaccines and pharmaceuticals. 
      Under his leadership I am confident that MMD will continue to advance 
      toward its goal of becoming a world-class supplier,” said Kenneth C. 
      Frazier, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck.
    

      Chattopadhyay joined Merck in 2009 and currently serves as senior vice 
      president of Global Manufacturing Operations (Human Health). He was 
      instrumental in transforming Merck Vaccines’ manufacturing and supply to 
      grow and globalize the company’s vaccines business. Chattopadhyay also 
      played a key part in leading the company’s launch of KEYTRUDA 
      (pembrolizumab) in record time by mobilizing a cross-divisional effort 
      to overcome commercialization and supply constraints.
    

      Deese joined Merck in 2004 to lead the global procurement team in MMD. 
      In 2005, he was promoted to president of MMD and joined the company’s 
      executive committee. Among his many accomplishments as president of MMD 
      was the “Target ’15” strategy, a five-year program that improved both 
      operational efficiencies in manufacturing and financial results. 
      Additionally, Deese led the company’s multi-year, strategic initiative 
      to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus, redesign 
      its operating model and reduce its cost base. The initiative succeeded 
      in exceeding its goal by the end of 2015 of realizing $2.5 billion in 
      annual net cost savings versus 2012.
    

      “Under Willie’s leadership, we significantly improved our ability to 
      serve patients and customers globally and transformed our operating 
      model,” said Frazier. “I would like to thank Willie for his unwavering 
      focus on high performance, safety, compliance, and above all, customers 
      and patients.”
