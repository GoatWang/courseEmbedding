History[edit]
Stanley Feldberg was one of the 1956 founders of Zayre Corp. He served as president of the company until 1978, and afterwards remained on the Board of Directors, until he retired in 1989.[7] Once the company had sold off the "Zayre" name, the company consisted of its one core remaining store brand, T.J.Maxx.[7] The next year, in 1990, TJX expanded into an additional store brand division, and at the same time it first went international, as it entered the Canadian market by acquiring the five-store Winners chain.[7] Two years later, it launched its third brand, HomeGoods, in the United States.[7] TJX's expansion beyond North America came in 1994, when the fourth brand division, T.K. Maxx, was founded in the United Kingdom, and then expanded into Ireland.[7]
In 1995, TJX doubled in size when it acquired Marshalls, its fifth brand. T.J.Maxx and Marshalls later became consolidated as two brands under a single division, The Marmaxx Group.[7] The following year, TJX Companies Inc. was added to the Standard & Poor's S&P 500 Composite Index, which consists of 500 of the largest companies in the United States.[8]
TJX launched a sixth brand, A.J. Wright, in 1998 in the eastern U.S. The brand went national in 2004 when it opened its first stores in California on the west coast.[7] The company's seventh brand division, HomeSense, formed in 2001, was a Canadian brand modeled after the existing US brand, HomeGoods.[7]
In 2002, TJX revenue reached almost $12 billion.[7] In mid-2003, TJX acquired an eighth brand division, Bob's Stores, concentrated in New England. In Canada, TJX began to configure some Winners and HomeSense stores side-by-side as superstores. The superstores feature open passageways between them, with dual branding. TJX's revenue in 2003 reached over $13 billion.[7] TJX began to test the side-by-side superstore model in the United States in 2004, combining some of each of the two Marmaxx brand stores with HomeGoods. The company reached 141st position in the 2004 Fortune 500 rankings, with almost $15 billion in revenue. That year was also marked by the death of retired Zayre founder Stanley Feldberg.[7]
In April 2008, TJX launched the HomeSense brand in the UK, with six stores opening throughout May. The brand is more upmarket than its Canadian namesake. Later that year, in August, TJX sold Bob's Stores to Versa Capital Management and Crystal Capital.[9]
In December 2010, TJX announced that the A.J. Wright stores would be closed, cutting about 4,400 jobs, and that more than half of them would reopen under other company brands.[10]
In July 2015, TJX acquired the Trade Secret and Home Secret off-price retail businesses from Australian company Gazal Corporation Limited. The deal will be completed December 2015.
Computer systems intrusion[edit]
On January 17, 2007, TJX announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion. It discovered in mid-December 2006 that its computer systems were compromised and customer data was stolen.[11] The hackers accessed a system that stores data on credit card, debit card, check, and merchandise return transactions.[12] The intrusion was kept confidential as requested by law enforcement. TJX said that it is working with General Dynamics, IBM and Deloitte to upgrade computer security.
By the end of March 2007, the number of affected customers had reached 45.7 million [13] and has prompted credit bureaus to seek legislation requiring retailers to be responsible for compromised customer information saved in their systems. In addition to credit card numbers, personal information such as social security numbers and driver's license numbers from 451,000 customers were downloaded by the intruders. The breach was possible due to a non-secure wireless network in one of the stores.[14]
Eleven men have been charged in the theft, and one (Damon Patrick Toey) has pleaded guilty to numerous charges related to the breach.[15] One man, Jonathan James, professed his innocence and later committed suicide, apparently out of the belief that he was going to be indicted.[16]
The alleged ringleader Albert Gonzalez was indicted in August 2009 with attacking Heartland Payment Systems in which 130 million records were compromised.[17]

Wright, in 1998 in the eastern U.S. The brand went national in 2004 when it opened its first stores in California on the west coast.[7] The company's seventh brand division, HomeSense, formed in 2001, was a Canadian brand modeled after the existing US brand, HomeGoods.[7]
In 2002, TJX revenue reached almost $12 billion.[7] In mid-2003, TJX acquired an eighth brand division, Bob's Stores, concentrated in New England. In Canada, TJX began to configure some Winners and HomeSense stores side-by-side as superstores. The superstores feature open passageways between them, with dual branding. TJX's revenue in 2003 reached over $13 billion.[7] TJX began to test the side-by-side superstore model in the United States in 2004, combining some of each of the two Marmaxx brand stores with HomeGoods. The company reached 141st position in the 2004 Fortune 500 rankings, with almost $15 billion in revenue. That year was also marked by the death of retired Zayre founder Stanley Feldberg.[7]
In April 2008, TJX launched the HomeSense brand in the UK, with six stores opening throughout May. The brand is more upmarket than its Canadian namesake. Later that year, in August, TJX sold Bob's Stores to Versa Capital Management and Crystal Capital.[9]
In December 2010, TJX announced that the A.J. Wright stores would be closed, cutting about 4,400 jobs, and that more than half of them would reopen under other company brands.[10]
In July 2015, TJX acquired the Trade Secret and Home Secret off-price retail businesses from Australian company Gazal Corporation Limited. The deal will be completed December 2015.
Computer systems intrusion[edit]
On January 17, 2007, TJX announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion. It discovered in mid-December 2006 that its computer systems were compromised and customer data was stolen.[11] The hackers accessed a system that stores data on credit card, debit card, check, and merchandise return transactions.[12] The intrusion was kept confidential as requested by law enforcement. TJX said that it is working with General Dynamics, IBM and Deloitte to upgrade computer security.
By the end of March 2007, the number of affected customers had reached 45.7 million [13] and has prompted credit bureaus to seek legislation requiring retailers to be responsible for compromised customer information saved in their systems. In addition to credit card numbers, personal information such as social security numbers and driver's license numbers from 451,000 customers were downloaded by the intruders. The breach was possible due to a non-secure wireless network in one of the stores.[14]
Eleven men have been charged in the theft, and one (Damon Patrick Toey) has pleaded guilty to numerous charges related to the breach.[15] One man, Jonathan James, professed his innocence and later committed suicide, apparently out of the belief that he was going to be indicted.[16]
The alleged ringleader Albert Gonzalez was indicted in August 2009 with attacking Heartland Payment Systems in which 130 million records were compromised.[17]

History[edit]
Stanley Feldberg was one of the 1956 founders of Zayre Corp. He served as president of the company until 1978, and afterwards remained on the Board of Directors, until he retired in 1989.[7] Once the company had sold off the "Zayre" name, the company consisted of its one core remaining store brand, T.J.Maxx.[7] The next year, in 1990, TJX expanded into an additional store brand division, and at the same time it first went international, as it entered the Canadian market by acquiring the five-store Winners chain.[7] Two years later, it launched its third brand, HomeGoods, in the United States.[7] TJX's expansion beyond North America came in 1994, when the fourth brand division, T.K. Maxx, was founded in the United Kingdom, and then expanded into Ireland.[7]
In 1995, TJX doubled in size when it acquired Marshalls, its fifth brand. T.J.Maxx and Marshalls later became consolidated as two brands under a single division, The Marmaxx Group.[7] The following year, TJX Companies Inc. was added to the Standard & Poor's S&P 500 Composite Index, which consists of 500 of the largest companies in the United States.[8]
TJX launched a sixth brand, A.J. Wright, in 1998 in the eastern U.S. The brand went national in 2004 when it opened its first stores in California on the west coast.[7] The company's seventh brand division, HomeSense, formed in 2001, was a Canadian brand modeled after the existing US brand, HomeGoods.[7]
In 2002, TJX revenue reached almost $12 billion.[7] In mid-2003, TJX acquired an eighth brand division, Bob's Stores, concentrated in New England. In Canada, TJX began to configure some Winners and HomeSense stores side-by-side as superstores. The superstores feature open passageways between them, with dual branding. TJX's revenue in 2003 reached over $13 billion.[7] TJX began to test the side-by-side superstore model in the United States in 2004, combining some of each of the two Marmaxx brand stores with HomeGoods. The company reached 141st position in the 2004 Fortune 500 rankings, with almost $15 billion in revenue. That year was also marked by the death of retired Zayre founder Stanley Feldberg.[7]
In April 2008, TJX launched the HomeSense brand in the UK, with six stores opening throughout May. The brand is more upmarket than its Canadian namesake. Later that year, in August, TJX sold Bob's Stores to Versa Capital Management and Crystal Capital.[9]
In December 2010, TJX announced that the A.J. Wright stores would be closed, cutting about 4,400 jobs, and that more than half of them would reopen under other company brands.[10]
In July 2015, TJX acquired the Trade Secret and Home Secret off-price retail businesses from Australian company Gazal Corporation Limited. The deal will be completed December 2015.
Computer systems intrusion[edit]
On January 17, 2007, TJX announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion. It discovered in mid-December 2006 that its computer systems were compromised and customer data was stolen.[11] The hackers accessed a system that stores data on credit card, debit card, check, and merchandise return transactions.[12] The intrusion was kept confidential as requested by law enforcement. TJX said that it is working with General Dynamics, IBM and Deloitte to upgrade computer security.
By the end of March 2007, the number of affected customers had reached 45.7 million [13] and has prompted credit bureaus to seek legislation requiring retailers to be responsible for compromised customer information saved in their systems. In addition to credit card numbers, personal information such as social security numbers and driver's license numbers from 451,000 customers were downloaded by the intruders. The breach was possible due to a non-secure wireless network in one of the stores.[14]
Eleven men have been charged in the theft, and one (Damon Patrick Toey) has pleaded guilty to numerous charges related to the breach.[15] One man, Jonathan James, professed his innocence and later committed suicide, apparently out of the belief that he was going to be indicted.[16]
The alleged ringleader Albert Gonzalez was indicted in August 2009 with attacking Heartland Payment Systems in which 130 million records were compromised.[17]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017), January 30, 2016 (fiscal 2016) and January 31, 2015 (fiscal 2015).  OVERVIEW  We are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. We sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We operate over 3,800 stores through our four main segments: in the U.S., Marmaxx (which operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods; TJX Canada (which operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada); and TJX International, (which operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe, and Trade Secret in Australia). In the U.S. we also operate Sierra Trading Post (STP), an off-price Internet retailer with a small number of stores. The results of STP are reported in our Marmaxx segment.  Fiscal 2017 was another successful year for TJX. We posted a strong increase in net sales and solid earnings per share growth on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. We continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we continue to reinvest in our business by adding new stores and remodeling existing ones, while continuing to strengthen our infrastructure in support of our continuing growth, and we implemented the second phase of our wage initiative to raise wages for U.S. hourly store associates.  Highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2017 include the following:  - Same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2017 over an increase of 5% in fiscal 2016 and an increase of 2% in fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2017 increase was driven primarily by an increase in customer traffic.  - Net sales increased to $33.2 billion for fiscal 2017, up 7% over the same period last year. Net sales increased to $30.9 billion for fiscal 2016, up 6% over the prior year. At January 28, 2017, the number of stores in operation increased 5% and selling square footage increased 4% over the end of fiscal 2016.  - Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 were $3.46 per diluted share compared to $3.33 per diluted share in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 earnings per share was reduced by $0.07 from a loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a pension settlement charge during the third quarter.  - Our fiscal 2017 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 11.2%, a 0.6 percentage point decrease compared to our fiscal 2016 pre-tax margin. The two third quarter charges reduced pre-tax margin by 0.3 percentage points in fiscal 2017.  - Our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2017 was 71.0%, a 0.2 percentage point decrease compared to the fiscal 2016 ratio. This improvement was driven by an increase in merchandise margin.  - Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2017 increased 0.6 percentage points to 17.4% from 16.8% in fiscal 2016. This increase is primarily due to higher store payroll costs due to wage increases and investments to support our growth.  - Our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce businesses, were down 5% (down 4% on a constant currency basis) at the end of fiscal 2017 as compared to the prior year.  - During fiscal 2017, we repurchased 22.3 million shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion. Earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. In January 2017, our Board of Directors authorized our 18th stock repurchase program for an additional $1.0 billion.  The following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results.  Net sales: Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 totaled $33.2 billion, a 7% increase over $30.9 billion in fiscal 2016. The increase reflected a 5% increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new stores,  offset by a 2% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales from our e-commerce businesses amount to approximately 1% of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2017 sales growth. Consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 totaled $30.9 billion, a 6% increase over $29.1 billion in fiscal 2015. The increase reflected a 5% increase from same store sales and a 4% increase from new stores, offset by a 3% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates.  Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2017 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. We also had a strong increase in units sold which was largely offset by a reduction in the average ticket. In fiscal 2017, home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strong in virtually all regions, with the Southeast and the Great Lakes regions reporting the highest same store sales growth. In Canada, same store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while TJX International was below the consolidated average.  Same store sales increases in the U.S. for fiscal 2016 were due to an increase in customer traffic. We also had a strong increase in units sold which was offset by a reduction in the average ticket. In fiscal 2016, home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth. Geographically, in the U.S., sales were strong in virtually all regions, with the Southeast reporting the highest same store sales growth. In Canada, same store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while TJX International was slightly below the consolidated average.  We define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. The sales of our e-commerce businesses, meaning Sierra Trading Post (including stores), tjmaxx.com and tkmaxx.com, are not included in same store sales. We classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. The recently acquired Trade Secret stores will be included in same store sales when they meet the above definition. We determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. We calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. Relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. Same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year's same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. This removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. We define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. We define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation.  The following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales:   Percentage of Net Sales Fiscal Year 2017 Fiscal Year 2016 Fiscal Year 2015 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs 71.0 71.2 71.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 17.4 16.8 16.1 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 0.2 - 0.1 Pension settlement charge 0.1 - - Interest expense, net 0.1 0.1 0.1 Income before provision for income taxes* 11.2 % 11.8 % 12.2 % Diluted earnings per share $ 3.46 $ 3.33 $ 3.15  * Figures may not foot due to rounding.  Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to other currencies. Two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows:  - Translation of foreign operating results into U.S. dollars: In our financial statements, we translate the operations of TJX Canada and TJX International from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. Currency translation generally does not affect operating margins as a percentage of net sales, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.  - Inventory-related derivatives: We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally TJX Canada and TJX International. As we have not elected "hedge accounting" for these instruments as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. In subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. While these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. The mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.  We refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as "foreign currency." This does not include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division's local currency. When discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates on such transactions we refer to it as "transactional foreign exchange."  Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: Cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 71.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to 71.2% in fiscal 2016 and 71.5% in fiscal 2015. The improvement in this expense ratio was driven by an increase in our profit margin on merchandise sold (merchandise margin) along with leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5% same store sales increase. Together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2017 expense ratio by approximately 0.5 percentage points. Merchandise margin improved despite the continued pressure transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise at our foreign segments this year versus the prior year. Although not as significant as in fiscal 2016, the change in exchange rates continued to impact the cost of merchandise that was denominated in currencies other than our foreign segments' local currency, primarily the U.S. dollar. These improvements were partially offset by higher supply chain costs and the negative impact of the mark to market of inventory derivatives.  The improvement in the fiscal 2016 expense ratio as compared to fiscal 2015 was driven by leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5% same store sales increase along with an increase in merchandise margin. Similar to fiscal 2017, together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2016 expense ratio by approximately 0.5 percentage points. Merchandise margin improved despite the negative impact transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise for TJX Canada and Europe for fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. The change in exchange rates increased the cost of merchandise purchased by TJX Canada and Europe that were denominated in currencies other than the divisions' respective local currency, primarily the U.S. dollar. This expense ratio was also negatively impacted by increased freight and distribution costs associated with moving more units through our supply chain and the mark to market of inventory derivatives.  Selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 17.4% in fiscal 2017, 16.8% in fiscal 2016 and 16.1% in fiscal 2015. The increase in this ratio in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs, due to wage  increases, investments to support our growth and supply chain costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced contributions to the TJX charitable foundations in fiscal 2017.  Similar to fiscal 2017, the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs, due to our wage initiative and an increase in supply chain costs, along with our incremental investments. In addition the fiscal 2016 expense ratio was unfavorably impacted by higher contributions to TJX's charitable foundations in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year.  Loss on early extinguishment of debt: On September 12, 2016 we issued $1.0 billion of 2.25% ten year notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our $375 million 6.95% notes on October 12, 2016, prior to their scheduled maturity of April 15, 2019. We recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $51.8 million.  Pension settlement charge: During the fiscal 2017 third quarter, we offered eligible former TJX Associates, who had not yet commenced receiving their qualified pension plan benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. On October 21, 2016, TJX's qualified pension plan paid $103.2 million from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer. This transaction had no cash impact on TJX, but did result in a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $31.2 million.  Interest expense, net: The components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:   Fiscal Year Ended January 28, January 30, January 31, Dollars in thousands 2017 2016 2015 Interest expense $ 69,219 $ 68,253 $ 64,783 Capitalized interest (7,548 ) (7,984 ) (9,403 ) Interest (income) (18,137 ) (13,869 ) (15,593 ) Interest expense, net $ 43,534 $ 46,400 $ 39,787  The decrease in net interest expense for fiscal 2017 is due to additional interest income as a result of an increase in investments as well as an increase in interest rates.  The increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2016 reflects interest expense in fiscal 2016 on the financing lease obligation related to TJX Canada's new home office of $3.7 million. The increase in net interest expense also reflects a reduction in capitalized interest costs and interest income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.  Income taxes: Our effective annual income tax rate was 38.3% in fiscal 2017, 37.7% in fiscal 2016 and 37.6% in fiscal 2015. The increase in the fiscal 2017 income tax rate was due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses. In addition, the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rates benefitted from a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to our adoption of the new Tangible Property Regulations. The increase in the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rate, as compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses.  Net income and diluted earnings per share: Net income was $2.3 billion in fiscal 2017, a 1% increase over $2.3 billion in fiscal 2016, which in turn was a 3% increase over $2.2 billion in fiscal 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $3.46 in fiscal 2017, $3.33 in fiscal 2016 and $3.15 in fiscal 2015. The third quarter charges from the loss on early extinguishment of debt and the pension settlement, collectively reduced fiscal 2017 net income by $50.0 million, or $0.07 per share. Foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.07 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016, and a $0.09 negative impact in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015.  Our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3% in each fiscal year. We repurchased 22.3 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017, 26.5 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.8 billion in fiscal 2016 and 27.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2015.  Segment information: We operate four main business segments. Our Marmaxx (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods segments both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX International segment operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe and Trade Secret in Australia. In the U.S., we also operate STP, an off-price Internet retailer with a small number of stores. We currently consider all of STP, including its limited number of stores, as part of our e-commerce businesses. The results of STP have been included in our Marmaxx segment. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on "segment profit or loss," which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, the pension settlement charge and interest expense. "Segment profit or loss," as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. The terms "segment margin" or "segment profit margin" are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. These measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.  Presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments:  U.S. Segments: Marmaxx Fiscal Year Ended January 28, January 30, January 31, Dollars in millions 2017 2016 2015 Net sales $ 21,246.0 $ 19,948.2 $ 18,687.9 Segment profit $ 2,995.0 $ 2,858.8 $ 2,736.7 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 14.1 % 14.3 % 14.6 % Increase in same store sales 5 % 4 % 1 % Stores in operation at end of period T.J. Maxx 1,186 1,156 1,119 Marshalls 1,035 1,007 975 STP 12 8 6 Total 2,233 2,171 2,100 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) T.J. Maxx 26,614 26,158 25,461 Marshalls 24,750 24,308 23,715 STP 227 159 122 Total 51,591 50,625 49,298  Net sales at Marmaxx increased 7% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase reflected a 5% increase from same store sales and a 2% increase from new store sales. The same store sales increase of 5% in fiscal 2017 is on top of a 4% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic. Marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold, which was largely offset by a decrease in the average ticket. Geographically, same store sales were strong throughout most of the country with the Southeast and Great Lakes regions particularly strong. Home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2017 with both categories posting same store sales growth. Overall, e-commerce sales represent approximately 2% of Marmaxx's net sales.  The same store sales increase of 4% in fiscal 2016 was on top of a 1% increase in the prior year. Same store sales growth at Marmaxx for fiscal 2016 was due to an increase in customer traffic. Marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold, which was more than offset by a decrease in the average ticket. Our merchandise mix and pricing strategy throughout fiscal 2016 resulted in the lower average ticket which we believe contributed to strong growth in customer traffic and in units sold. Geographically, same store sales were strong throughout most of the country with the Southeast region particularly strong. Home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2016 with both categories posting same store sales growth.  Segment margin in fiscal 2017 was 14.1% compared to 14.3% in fiscal 2016. Marmaxx results for fiscal 2017 reflect an increase in merchandise margin and buying and occupancy expense leverage, on same store  sales growth, of approximately 0.7 percentage points. However, these gains were more than offset by higher store payroll costs, primarily due to wage increases and processing more units at the store level, higher distribution costs, as well as an increase in credit card chargeback costs. Tjmaxx.com and STP (our U.S. e-commerce businesses) did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons.  Segment margin in fiscal 2016 was 14.3%, compared to 14.6% in fiscal 2015. Marmaxx results for fiscal 2016 reflect improvements in merchandise margin and occupancy expense leverage, on same store sales growth, of approximately 0.6 percentage points. However, these gains were offset by higher distribution costs, reflecting the increase in units processed as well as higher store payroll, primarily due to our wage initiative, and processing more units at the store level. In addition, tjmaxx.com and STP (our U.S. e-commerce businesses) had a negative impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons of 0.3 percentage points. Our e-commerce businesses operate at lower profit margins and at STP, we incurred additional costs as we continue to transition this business to a more fully off-price model and to adjust its merchandise mix.  In fiscal 2018, we expect to open approximately 65 Marmaxx stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.  HomeGoods Fiscal Year Ended January 28, January 30, January 31, Dollars in millions 2017 2016 2015 Net sales $ 4,404.6 $ 3,915.2 $ 3,414.4 Segment profit $ 613.8 $ 549.3 $ 463.2 Segment profit as a percentage of net sales 13.9 % 14.0 % 13.6 % Increase in same store sales 6 % 8 % 7 % Stores in operation at end of period 579 526 487 Selling square footage at end of period (in thousands) 11,119 10,234 9,537  HomeGoods' net sales increased 12% in fiscal 2017, on top of a 15% increase in fiscal 2016. The increase in fiscal 2017 reflected a 6% increase from same store sales and a 6% increase from new store sales. The sales increase of 15% in fiscal 2016 reflected a same store sales increase of 8% and an increase from new stores of 7%. The increase in same store sales for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic.  Segment profit margin for fiscal 2017 was 13.9% compared to 14.0% for fiscal 2016. Segment margin for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted by an increase in merchandise margin and expense leverage, primarily occupancy costs, on strong same store sales growth. These increases in segment margin were more than offset by higher payroll costs related to wage increases, an increase in distribution costs, which includes the opening of a new distribution center in fiscal 2017, and an increase in credit card chargeback costs. Segment profit margin for fiscal 2016 was 14.0%, up from 13.6% for fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2016 was driven by expense leverage, primarily buying and occupancy costs, on strong same store sales growth and an increase in merchandise margin, partially offset by an increase in distribution costs and higher payroll costs related to our wage initiative.  In fiscal 2018, we plan an increase of approximately 81 HomeGoods stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 11%. We also plan on launching a new U.S. home concept, with the first few stores opening later in fiscal 2018.

The TJX Companies, Inc.: Time to Disrupt the Home Furnishings Market?
TJX is poised to disrupt home-focused retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond, just as it has disrupted department stores in recent years.











                Adam Levine-Weinberg
            

                (TMFGemHunter)



            
            Feb 27, 2017 at 5:25PM
            
            





Over the past two decades, TJX (NYSE:TJX) has upended the U.S. fashion retail business with its off-price T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains. A couple of years ago, it surpassed No. 1 department store chain Macy's in terms of revenue, and that gap continues to grow. TJX's massive success has inspired a host of competitors to enter the off-price business.
With more than 2,200 T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores operating in the U.S. today, TJX may be starting to saturate the apparel market. As a result, TJX is now turning to the home furnishings market to drive a greater percentage of its future growth. This puts different rivals like Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) in its crosshairs.
Sales explode at HomeGoods
TJX carries various home decor items at the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains. However, seeing a greater opportunity, the company launched the stand-alone HomeGoods store concept 25 years ago. In recent years, HomeGoods has been the fastest-growing part of TJX's business.
Five years ago, HomeGoods had 374 stores and generated an annual segment profit of $234 million on $2.24 billion of revenue. Since then, TJX has expanded the U.S. HomeGoods store count to 579. Meanwhile, comp sales have remained on a strong upward trend, and the segment profit margin has expanded.

HomeGoods has been a key growth driver for TJX recently. Image source: The Motley Fool.

As a result, in TJX's recently ended 2017 fiscal year, HomeGoods' sales reached $4.40 billion, up 96% from five years earlier. Over the same period, HomeGoods' segment profit surged 162%, reaching $614 million last year.
HomeGoods has plenty of room to grow. It is still a fraction of the size of Bed Bath & Beyond, perhaps its most direct competitor. (Bed Bath & Beyond currently generates about $12 billion of annual revenue.) Furthermore, total revenue for the broader home furnishings and furniture market in the U.S. is around $100 billion. Lastly, there are no other major off-price home furnishings chains, whereas the off-price apparel market is getting crowded.
In recent years, TJX's management has estimated that HomeGoods could eventually grow to be a 1,000 store chain in the U.S. That would entail an expansion of more than 70% from its current store base.
More growth on the horizon
Last week, management announced that HomeGoods will accelerate its expansion in the coming year. TJX plans to open about 80 new HomeGoods stores in the U.S. during fiscal 2018, compared to a combined 65 openings for the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains.
About 20 of these new HomeGoods stores will be built inside some of the larger existing T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores. In effect, those locations will be getting expanded home departments.
Additionally, CEO Ernie Herrman revealed that TJX will pilot a second home store concept, with the first four stores opening later this year. The new chain will focus on slightly different product categories relative to HomeGoods. In this way, the two chains will complement one another, in the same way that T.J. Maxx and Marshalls coexist successfully. TJX believes that the new home chain can grow without hurting HomeGoods' ability to reach 1,000 stores.





Bed Bath & Beyond needs to watch out
TJX has steadily gained share at department stores' expense for two decades, due to the inherent flexibility of the off-price business model. As a result, its revenue has surged from less than $7 billion to more than $33 billion over that period.

For the same reason, TJX's growth in the home furnishings market could put pressure on retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond.
Bed Bath & Beyond isn't completely blind to the off-price threat; it dipped its toe into the water last year by buying flash sale site One Kings Lane for about $12 million. Nevertheless, the vast majority of its business is vulnerable as TJX expands with additional home furnishings stores and new product categories. Thus, long-suffering Bed Bath & Beyond shareholders could be in for more pain in the coming years.



Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Macy's and is long January 2018 $60 calls on The TJX Companies and short January 2018 $90 calls on The TJX Companies. The Motley Fool recommends Bed Bath and Beyond. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

TJX Companies' (TJX) Homesense Concept Stores Set for Launch


July 19, 2017, 10:35:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

  The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX  is set to open its new off-price home concept "Homesense" on Aug 17 at Framingham, MA. Homesense would offer trendy and high quality products at a great value. The shopping experience at the store would compliment that of its sister chain, HomeGoods, by providing expanded departments for furniture, lighting and art. This new home concept would include a gallery where shoppers can browse and select from a wide range of chairs of different sizes and shapes. Customers will also be able to find bar and game room furniture that include pool tables, card tables and more. Free-standing fixtures and oversized easels would compliment the art display, aiding a gallery-style shopping. With such unique features, Homesense concept in the U.S. will differ from that in Canada and Europe, despite sharing a similar name. More Homesense store openings are planned by the end of this year in Massachusetts (at Westwood) and New Jersey (at Hanover and Ocean Township). The management is quite confident regarding this new off-price home concept and expects that customers would enjoy shopping at Homesense, based on the feedbacks from TJ Maxx and Marshalls. This store opening is in line with the company's ongoing store expansion strategy. With almost 3,800 stores in nine countries, TJX Companies plans to grow to 5,600 stores over the long term. The company has plans to open nearly 250 stores in fiscal 2018. Store expansion plans mainly cover the regions of the U.S., Europe and Canada. Moreover, TJX Companies has reported positive comparable store sales (comps) growth in the past 32 quarters. Higher traffic driven by new and existing customers resulted in the company's impressive performance. The company's fresh stock and widespread sourcing machinery has helped it maintain a loyal consumer base. Alongside such store expansion strategies, the company has also undertaken several initiatives for boosting e-commerce sales. Aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums compliment the sales enhancing efforts. Nevertheless, the company's performance remains exposed to currency headwinds and rising product costs. Though shares of TJX Companies have declined 7.3% in the past six months, it is narrower than the decline of the Zacks categorized Retail-Discount & Variety  industry that declined 9.1%.    The company currently has a VGM Score  of "A" and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  Looking for More Stocks in the Retail Space? Check   these  Investors may consider stocks such as Best Buy Co., Inc. BBY  which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) along with The Children's Place, Inc. PLCE  and Burlington Stores, Inc. BURL  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.   Best Buy delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 33.8% in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.8%. Children's Place delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 36.6% in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8%. Burlington Stores delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 22.6% in the trailing four quarters and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.9%.  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Stanley Feldberg was one of the 1956 founders of Zayre Corp. He served as president of the company until 1978, and afterwards remained on the Board of Directors, until he retired in 1989.[7] Once the company had sold off the "Zayre" name, the company consisted of its one core remaining store brand, T.J.Maxx.[7] The next year, in 1990, TJX expanded into an additional store brand division, and at the same time it first went international, as it entered the Canadian market by acquiring the five-store Winners chain.[7] Two years later, it launched its third brand, HomeGoods, in the United States.[7] TJX's expansion beyond North America came in 1994, when the fourth brand division, T.K. Maxx, was founded in the United Kingdom, and then expanded into Ireland.[7]
In 1995, TJX doubled in size when it acquired Marshalls, its fifth brand. T.J.Maxx and Marshalls later became consolidated as two brands under a single division, The Marmaxx Group.[7] The following year, TJX Companies Inc. was added to the Standard & Poor's S&P 500 Composite Index, which consists of 500 of the largest companies in the United States.[8]
TJX launched a sixth brand, A.J. Wright, in 1998 in the eastern U.S. The brand went national in 2004 when it opened its first stores in California on the west coast.[7] The company's seventh brand division, HomeSense, formed in 2001, was a Canadian brand modeled after the existing US brand, HomeGoods.[7]
In 2002, TJX revenue reached almost $12 billion.[7] In mid-2003, TJX acquired an eighth brand division, Bob's Stores, concentrated in New England. In Canada, TJX began to configure some Winners and HomeSense stores side-by-side as superstores. The superstores feature open passageways between them, with dual branding. TJX's revenue in 2003 reached over $13 billion.[7] TJX began to test the side-by-side superstore model in the United States in 2004, combining some of each of the two Marmaxx brand stores with HomeGoods. The company reached 141st position in the 2004 Fortune 500 rankings, with almost $15 billion in revenue. That year was also marked by the death of retired Zayre founder Stanley Feldberg.[7]
In April 2008, TJX launched the HomeSense brand in the UK, with six stores opening throughout May. The brand is more upmarket than its Canadian namesake. Later that year, in August, TJX sold Bob's Stores to Versa Capital Management and Crystal Capital.[9]
In December 2010, TJX announced that the A.J. Wright stores would be closed, cutting about 4,400 jobs, and that more than half of them would reopen under other company brands.[10]
In July 2015, TJX acquired the Trade Secret and Home Secret off-price retail businesses from Australian company Gazal Corporation Limited. The deal will be completed December 2015.
Computer systems intrusion[edit]
On January 17, 2007, TJX announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion. It discovered in mid-December 2006 that its computer systems were compromised and customer data was stolen.[11] The hackers accessed a system that stores data on credit card, debit card, check, and merchandise return transactions.[12] The intrusion was kept confidential as requested by law enforcement. TJX said that it is working with General Dynamics, IBM and Deloitte to upgrade computer security.
By the end of March 2007, the number of affected customers had reached 45.7 million [13] and has prompted credit bureaus to seek legislation requiring retailers to be responsible for compromised customer information saved in their systems. In addition to credit card numbers, personal information such as social security numbers and driver's license numbers from 451,000 customers were downloaded by the intruders. The breach was possible due to a non-secure wireless network in one of the stores.[14]
Eleven men have been charged in the theft, and one (Damon Patrick Toey) has pleaded guilty to numerous charges related to the breach.[15] One man, Jonathan James, professed his innocence and later committed suicide, apparently out of the belief that he was going to be indicted.[16]
The alleged ringleader Albert Gonzalez was indicted in August 2009 with attacking Heartland Payment Systems in which 130 million records were compromised.[17]

Ernie Herrman serves as company CEO since January 31st 2016. The corporate headquarters are located at 770 Cochituate Road in Framingham, Massachusetts.[5]

History[edit]
Stanley Feldberg was one of the 1956 founders of Zayre Corp. He served as president of the company until 1978, and afterwards remained on the Board of Directors, until he retired in 1989.[7] Once the company had sold off the "Zayre" name, the company consisted of its one core remaining store brand, T.J.Maxx.[7] The next year, in 1990, TJX expanded into an additional store brand division, and at the same time it first went international, as it entered the Canadian market by acquiring the five-store Winners chain.[7] Two years later, it launched its third brand, HomeGoods, in the United States.[7] TJX's expansion beyond North America came in 1994, when the fourth brand division, T.K. Maxx, was founded in the United Kingdom, and then expanded into Ireland.[7]
In 1995, TJX doubled in size when it acquired Marshalls, its fifth brand. T.J.Maxx and Marshalls later became consolidated as two brands under a single division, The Marmaxx Group.[7] The following year, TJX Companies Inc. was added to the Standard & Poor's S&P 500 Composite Index, which consists of 500 of the largest companies in the United States.[8]
TJX launched a sixth brand, A.J. Wright, in 1998 in the eastern U.S. The brand went national in 2004 when it opened its first stores in California on the west coast.[7] The company's seventh brand division, HomeSense, formed in 2001, was a Canadian brand modeled after the existing US brand, HomeGoods.[7]
In 2002, TJX revenue reached almost $12 billion.[7] In mid-2003, TJX acquired an eighth brand division, Bob's Stores, concentrated in New England. In Canada, TJX began to configure some Winners and HomeSense stores side-by-side as superstores. The superstores feature open passageways between them, with dual branding. TJX's revenue in 2003 reached over $13 billion.[7] TJX began to test the side-by-side superstore model in the United States in 2004, combining some of each of the two Marmaxx brand stores with HomeGoods. The company reached 141st position in the 2004 Fortune 500 rankings, with almost $15 billion in revenue. That year was also marked by the death of retired Zayre founder Stanley Feldberg.[7]
In April 2008, TJX launched the HomeSense brand in the UK, with six stores opening throughout May. The brand is more upmarket than its Canadian namesake. Later that year, in August, TJX sold Bob's Stores to Versa Capital Management and Crystal Capital.[9]
In December 2010, TJX announced that the A.J. Wright stores would be closed, cutting about 4,400 jobs, and that more than half of them would reopen under other company brands.[10]
In July 2015, TJX acquired the Trade Secret and Home Secret off-price retail businesses from Australian company Gazal Corporation Limited. The deal will be completed December 2015.
Computer systems intrusion[edit]
On January 17, 2007, TJX announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion. It discovered in mid-December 2006 that its computer systems were compromised and customer data was stolen.[11] The hackers accessed a system that stores data on credit card, debit card, check, and merchandise return transactions.[12] The intrusion was kept confidential as requested by law enforcement. TJX said that it is working with General Dynamics, IBM and Deloitte to upgrade computer security.
By the end of March 2007, the number of affected customers had reached 45.7 million [13] and has prompted credit bureaus to seek legislation requiring retailers to be responsible for compromised customer information saved in their systems. In addition to credit card numbers, personal information such as social security numbers and driver's license numbers from 451,000 customers were downloaded by the intruders. The breach was possible due to a non-secure wireless network in one of the stores.[14]
Eleven men have been charged in the theft, and one (Damon Patrick Toey) has pleaded guilty to numerous charges related to the breach.[15] One man, Jonathan James, professed his innocence and later committed suicide, apparently out of the belief that he was going to be indicted.[16]
The alleged ringleader Albert Gonzalez was indicted in August 2009 with attacking Heartland Payment Systems in which 130 million records were compromised.[17]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
