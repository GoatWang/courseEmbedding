TAVARES, Fla., June 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- For the second year in a row, Ruggie Wealth Management is pleased to announce it has been named to the Financial Times 300 Top Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) from among more than 12,000 SEC-registered RIAs across the U.S.  


"We're very honored to receive recognition as one of the finest investment management firms by one of the world's most prestigious and influential financial publications," said Thomas H. Ruggie, ChFC®, CFP®, President of Ruggie Wealth Management.
"For 25 years, we've worked to make a meaningful improvement in the financial lives of our clients, and I believe this recognition is another wonderful yardstick by which to measure our team's success," he added.
More than 1,500 RIA firms were pre-screened prior to their consideration, and then evaluated across six criteria: assets under management (AUM); AUM growth rate; years in existence; advanced industry credentials of the firm's advisers; online accessibility; and compliance records. There are no fees or other considerations required of RIAs that apply for the FT 300.
This is the fourth annual FT 300 list, produced independently by the Financial Times in collaboration with Ignites Research, a subsidiary of the Financial Times that provides business intelligence on the investment management industry. 
According to them, "The final FT 300 represents an impressive cohort of elite RIA firms, as the 'average' practice in this year's list has been in existence for 24 years and manages $2.7 billion in assets. The FT 300 Top RIAs hail from 37 states and Washington, D.C."
Ruggie Wealth Management provides services to individual and corporate clients, as well as to a select group of endowments and foundations. As the flagship company of Ruggie Capital Group, Ruggie Wealth offers a broad range of services and products to help clients achieve their financial goals. Ruggie Capital Group recently developed a multi-family office called Destiny Family Office - which expands their continuum of services to high-net worth and ultra-high net worth clients.
The firm has offices in Tavares, Winter Park, and The Villages®, FL.
About Tom Ruggie, ChFC®, CFPTom is a Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC®), a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ (CFP®) and a veteran of the investment and financial planning industries, who began his career in 1991 and subsequently founded Ruggie Wealth Management to serve individuals, small businesses and non-profit organizations. Ruggie's entrepreneurial spirit, investment strategy and steadfast dedication to client service have allowed him to grow Ruggie Wealth Management, Destiny Family Office, and related-companies into a continuum of financial services. The Florida native is also a philanthropist who founded The Tom and Kim Ruggie Family Foundation. He has authored two books available on Amazon: Ruggie Rules and Financial Wellness: How to Improve the Retirement Outcomes of Your Employees, and his newest book – called Ruggie WealthCare™ Retirement Scorecard – is set to be released.

About the Financial Times 300 Top Registered Investment AdvisersThe Financial Times 300 Top Registered Investment Advisers is an independent listing produced annually by the Financial Times (June, 2017). The FT 300 is based on data gathered from RIA firms, regulatory disclosures, and the FT's research. The listing reflected each practice's performance in six primary areas: assets under management, asset growth, compliance record, years in existence, credentials and online accessibility. This award does not evaluate the quality of services provided to clients and is not indicative of the practice's future performance. Neither the RIA firms nor their employees pay a fee to The Financial Times in exchange for inclusion in the FT 300.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Chase (NYSEMKT:CCF) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
