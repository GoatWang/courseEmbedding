About us


			  The Plutus Resources management have over 80 years of experience comprising   banking, venture capital, private equity, fund management and general business   management together with identifying opportunities in various sectors for   business growth opportunities and ultimately to maximise shareholders’ value. 
Ordinarily, the company will seek to acquire assets or companies operating in the natural resources sector unless an exceptional transaction is identified outside that sector.
The Company's Investing Policy is as follows:
The Directors intend initially to seek to acquire a direct and/or an indirect interest in projects and assets in
the oil and gas sector and within the wider natural resources sector. The Company will focus on opportunities
in Europe, North America and Africa but will consider possible opportunities anywhere in the world.
The Company may invest by way of purchasing equity, debt, convertible or other instruments in listed or
unlisted companies, outright acquisition or by the acquisition of assets, including the intellectual property,
of a relevant business, or by entering into partnerships or joint venture arrangements. Such investments may
result in the Company acquiring the whole or part of a company or project (which, in the case of an
investment in a company, may be private or listed on a stock exchange, and which may be pre-revenue) and
such investments may constitute a minority stake in the company or project in question. The Company will
not have a separate investment manager.
The Company may be both an active and a passive investor depending on the nature of the individual
investments. Although the Company intends to be a medium to long-term investor, the Directors will place
no minimum or maximum limit on the length of time that any investment may be held and therefore shorter
term disposal of any investments cannot be ruled out.
There will be no limit on the number of projects into which the Company may invest, and the Company's
financial resources may be invested in a number of propositions or in just one investment, which may be
deemed to be a reverse takeover pursuant to Rule 14 of the AIM Rules. The Company will carry out an
appropriate due diligence exercise on all potential investments and, where appropriate, with professional
advisers assisting as required. The Board's principal focus will be on achieving capital growth for
Shareholders.
Investments may be in all types of assets and there will be no investment restrictions.
The Company may require additional funding as investments are made and new opportunities arise. The
Directors may offer new Ordinary Shares by way of consideration as well as cash, thereby helping to
preserve the Company's cash resources for working capital. The Company may, in appropriate
circumstances, issue debt securities or otherwise borrow money to complete an investment. The Directors do
not intend to acquire any cross-holdings in other corporate entities that have an interest in the Ordinary
Shares.

This morning I had coffee with a lady from one of the emerging Asian private equity fund of funds. She told me that her team considers the Indian LP obsession with management fees quite bizarre. I am hearing this from every side at the moment.There is a growing sense that our local LPs would rather negotiate low fees than deploy their capital in high quality private equity funds. Overseas, management fees are relatively far down the mid-market LP agenda. When investors complain about fees, they are mostly talking about huge funds. But there are only about ten of those globally. India is a strange outlier in this respect. Many of our LPs appear absolutely obsessed with management fees. It’s not uncommon for them to raise the question of fees in the very first meeting or phone call. So why is this? I have a few theories:

Just 4 - 5 asset advisors control the majority of Indian LP capital. A strong personality or thought leader can have an influence on industry terms and conditions that would be impossible in the United States or Europe.
Perhaps ironically, the earliest financial backers of Indian private equity were large union retirement funds. They are notoriously fee conscious.
Our super (pension) funds are required to publish fund management expense ratios, or MERs. Unfortunately they often measure MER on drawn down, rather than committed capital. On this basis PE management fees will always appear disproportionately high and may draw the attention of the fund trustees. It takes a long time to discover whether a PE team has delivered good performance, but the management fees are evident on day one. And fund trustees are the top brass.
