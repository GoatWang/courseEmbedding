Be Wary Of This Skyrocketing Bitcoin Fund 

June 05, 2017 




 
Sumit Roy 





 



  


Bitcoin is flying. Prices for the digital currency briefly topped $2,800 in May, the latest milestone in what's become a parabolic move higher. Consider these figures: In the past month, bitcoin is up 68%; year-to-date, it's up 154%; over the past year, it's up 350%; and over the past two years, it's up 973%.
But as incredible as those moves have been, the performance of one bitcoin fund makes them look paltry by comparison. That fund is the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which has more than tripled in the past month alone, while rising an eye-popping 1,600% over the past two years.
2-Year Returns For Bitcoin And GBTC

 
The market value of the trust ballooned to as much as $1.1 billion in May, compared with $224 million at the beginning of the year.
Dangerous Premium To NAV
GBTC is an "open-ended trust" and the first publicly traded bitcoin investment vehicle. The fund made its debut on the OTC market in May 2015, and since then has been doing its best to track the price of bitcoin―with limited success.
Indeed, even though GBTC is a self-proclaimed open-ended trust (and its sponsor Grayscale has periodically created new shares), it's acted more like a closed-end fund, with huge premiums the norm.
The share price of GBTC was last trading at double the value of its underlying bitcoin holdings. At 131%, GBTC's premium to its net asset value is astronomical by any measure, and close to the highest level it's ever been. For investors buying into the fund, such large premiums are a disaster waiting to happen.
Premiums are a fickle thing, and can fluctuate wildly depending on the supply and demand for shares. For example, GBTC's premium has ranged from zero to 142%, with an average of 40%, since May 2015. 
 

 
Not An ETF
For investors used to buying exchange-traded funds, such large premiums are almost unheard of. In an ETF, large premiums and discounts are arbitraged away through the creation/redemption mechanism. When a premium becomes large, authorized participants will buy up the underlying, deliver it to the ETF provider in exchange for ETF shares, and sell them for a profit, pushing the ETF market price back towards the fund's NAV.
But GBTC isn't an ETF.  It doesn't abide by the stringent regulations and disclosure requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and currently, its only AP is Genesis Global Trading, an affiliated company that has only offered shares to investors in private placement transactions, according to Spencer Bogart, managing director and head of research for BlockChain Capital.
Up until early this year, share creations for GBTC took place through private transactions with accredited investors. Those new shares were subject to a one-year lockup period before they could be sold on the public market, hindering the ability to arbitrage any premium above NAV.  
After Jan. 19, Grayscale completely stopped issuing shares in connection with an SEC filing it made (more on that later), which means that what little ability to arbitrage the premium away before is now completely gone.  
Meanwhile, redemptions for GBTC have been completely suspended since 2016 after the trust and its AP were found to be in violation of an SEC rule.
Put that all together and you have a product that can't be considered an ETF even by the loosest definition. Grantor trusts, '40 Act funds, '33 Act commodity pools and even ETNs are often lumped together under the ETF umbrella. They all hold securities with a fluid, unrestricted creation and redemption mechanism that serves to keep the traded price close to the underlying fair value. GBTC fails that test (not to mention it doesn't trade on an actual exchange). 
Only Game In Town … For Now
Even with its flaws, clearly there's been a lot of demand for GBTC. Currently, the trust has a market value of nearly $1 billion and even counts two ETFs among its holders: the ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW) and the ARK Industrial Innovation ETF (ARKQ).
For investors who don't want to go through the hassle and risk of buying bitcoin directly from a digital currency exchange and storing it themselves, GBTC is, in many ways, the only game in town.
But it doesn't have to be. The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (COIN) was rejected by the SEC in March. The commission didn't allow the ETF to see the light of day because it was concerned about the lack of regulation in bitcoin markets, which could harm investors. Yet COIN would be vastly superior to the readily available GBTC, which is likely to burn investors who buy at premium prices.
GBTC's sponsor Grayscale is well aware of the deficiencies of its product. In January, the firm made a filing with the SEC to do an initial public offering on the NYSE. Grayscale also lined up three APs to replace its affiliate Genesis, if the filing is approved.
In other words, the sponsor hopes to convert GBTC into a fully fledged ETF.
That's probably a smart move. If COIN or another bitcoin ETF comes to market and competes with GBTC in its current form, the latter will likely see an exodus of assets as investors gravitate toward the superior ETF structure.
Indeed, in March, when it looked like the SEC could green-light the Winklevoss ETF, GBTC's premium briefly dropped to zero as demand for the product waned.
Stark Choice For SEC
Currently, the SEC is reviewing its disapproval of COIN. There's no timetable for when the commission will reach a decision. The SEC is also considering the Grayscale filing to IPO GBTC shares on the NYSE; that decision will be reached by Sept. 22.
There's plenty of skepticism about whether the SEC will turn around and finally approve a bona fide bitcoin ETF after already rejecting two [along with COIN, the SEC rejected the SolidX Bitcoin Trust (XBTC)].
But as the massive inflows into bitcoin in general and GBTC in particular indicate, investors are going to buy up the digital currency regardless of what the commission does. The SEC can either help investors by allowing a regulated ETF that trades close to NAV come to market, or stand in the way and see those same investors hurt when they buy bitcoin directly from untested exchanges or through the flawed GBTC.
At the time of writing, the author did not hold any positions in the securities mentioned. Contact Sumit Roy at [email protected].

How An ETF Gets Too Big For Its Index

April 10, 2017 




 
Sumit Roy 





 



  


Can an exchange-traded fund get too big for its index? That's the question investors in one popular gold miner ETF are grappling with after rapid asset growth pushed it to significantly deviate from its underlying index.
The ETF in question is the VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ), which tracks the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index. Since early 2016, assets in the fund ballooned from a little more than $1 billion to $5.4 billion currently. Some of that was due to rising share prices―GDXJ nearly doubled from $19.80 at the start of 2016 to $36.71 today, an 85% gain, thanks to the rebound in gold.
But a lot of it had to do with the enormous amount of new money that came into the fund. Since Jan. 1, 2016, inflows into the ETF have totaled $3.3 billion. For almost any ETF, that's a big amount, but especially for one that targets a relatively niche area like junior gold miners.
GDXJ Assets Under Management

Source: Bloomberg
Giant Stakes In Underlying HoldingsThe ETF has gotten so big that it now owns giant stakes in its underlying holdings, three-quarters of which are Canadian companies. According to an analysis by Scotiabank, there are 10 Canadian companies that the ETF owns where its ownership percentage is more than 18%.
For six of those companies, the percentage would be even greater, but presumably, the fund doesn't want to exceed the 20% level, which, under Canadian rules, would force the ETF "to automatically extend a takeover offer to all remaining shareholders at the same terms," according to a Scotiabank report.
The ETF has also struggled to abide by U.S. IRS diversification requirements. "GDXJ has intermittently been in jeopardy of losing its preferential tax treatment (as a regulated investment company) since last September because its portfolio often doesn’t comply with the diversification requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code," noted Scotiabank.
 
ETF Deviating From IndexIn an attempt to try to ameliorate the concentration issues it’s facing, the ETF now has five holdings that aren't index constituents, representing 25% of GDXJ's portfolio, according to BMO Capital Markets. One of those holdings is the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), another product from the same issuer, which focuses on much larger gold companies.
Chris Kwan, mining specialist at BMO, believes GDXJ has simply gotten too big for its benchmark now that it is a $5 billion ETF "attempting to invest in a ~$30B gold universe."
In Kwan's view, there are three ways forward for the ETF. It could continue with the status quo, creating uncertain and volatile quarterly rebalances; it could sell its nonindex gold stocks and increase its position in GDX; or it could expand the allowable market-cap size of the ETF.
Moving Beyond Junior Gold Miner Territory
In a way, the ETF has already de facto expanded the average size of its holdings. The nonindex names that it owns have the biggest weightings in the fund. That includes GDX, which has a weighted average market cap of $9.3 billion―well beyond small-cap, junior miner territory.
Perhaps the easiest fix for VanEck, which also develops the underlying index for GDXJ, is to expand what it considers to be the junior gold miner universe, something the issuer did in 2014 when faced with a similar situation. Why hasn't this happened already? That may be because the portfolio managers are holding out hope that, at some point, they can go back to employing a full replication strategy.
As Scotiabank points out, if VanEck expands the universe too much, the market cap for some of the holdings in the ETF would breach $2.5 billion, a level often used to define small-cap stocks. That's not necessarily a horrible thing, but it would take the ETF further away from offering the junior gold miner exposure that it promises.
VanEck wouldn't comment on its portfolio management decisions for this story, but said that "it continues to manage GDXJ so it meets its investment objective" even though "there may be times when certain market and regulatory factors affect the ability of GDXJ to own certain securities or own them in proportion to their index weightings."
 
JNUG Tail Wagging The GDXJ Dog
Of course, if asset growth for GDXJ remains strong, the issuer may have little choice but to broaden the scope of the ETF. What's interesting is that much of GDXJ's recent (and perhaps future) growth has come from an unlikely source: the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (JNUG).
Analysts at Scotiabank believe that most of the growth in GDXJ was due to inflows into JNUG, which offers 3x leveraged exposure to the same underlying index as GDXJ. Since early last year, JNUG has seen its assets rise from $100 million to more than $1 billion currently.
The analysts pointed out that according to the latest daily holdings report from JNUG, "nearly 53% of GDXJ’s shares outstanding could be held as hedges against swaps that underlie the 3x levered product."
That's an interesting twist in this saga if JNUG is the tail that’s wagging the GDXJ dog.
Bottom Line
For investors, the bottom line is that the holdings of their favorite junior gold miner ETF have gotten a little bit bigger on the market-cap spectrum. It's not necessarily a huge deal, but for those aggressive investors looking for targeted exposure to the smallest, most volatile gold miners, perhaps that's something that turns them off from the fund and compels them to look elsewhere.
On the other hand, GDXJ is by far the most liquid and tradable name in the junior gold miner space, and a marginal increase in its weighted average market cap isn't going to noticeably change the volatility of the fund or the exposure it offers.
