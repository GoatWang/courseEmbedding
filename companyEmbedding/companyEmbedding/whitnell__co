For Business Owners, Executives And Affluent Families  Financial Planning   A Solid Foundation For Your Family’s Finances  Financial planning is an often misunderstood discipline.  While many companies and individuals claim to offer financial planning, and the meaning of the term itself is often debated, there is no debate about one key concept.  The absence of a financial plan, or the presence of a poorly constructed financial plan, usually produces chaos, feelings of unrest and missed opportunities that, once passed, a family may never see again.  There are numerous reasons that new clients come to Whitnell seeking a financial plan.  Click here to learn more about this service >       Investment Management   Financial Clarity In A World Full Of Choices  When new clients come to Whitnell, they often have specific investment goals, some ideas about how to achieve those goals but usually little time. Most of our clients are deeply involved with their families, their careers, their businesses and the charities that drive them passionately forward. Managing their investments is important to them, but not at the top of their priority list. Click here to learn more about this service >       Family Office Services   For High Net-Worth Families With Complex Situations  Many successful families have acquired their wealth the old fashioned way: through hard work, discipline and risk-taking. But acquiring wealth and managing it are different skills. Successful families have many options for wealth management, but numerous options often mean numerous decisions and substantial complexity. This can make managing wealth burdensome. Click here to learn more about this service >       Retirement Planning   Financial Strategies For The Long-Term  More Americans today live longer and healthier lives than ever before. While long life is a good thing, in and of itself, it does give rise to one major concern. Many people are worried about outliving their money. This is a legitimate concern. While the right retirement plan can substantially alleviate this concern, building such a plan is now a very complex process that requires specialized skills and tools. Click here to learn more about this service >       Risk & Insurance Planning   Protect Your Wealth And Loved Ones  It takes most Americans a life time of work, risk-taking and saving to accumulate wealth. So it only makes sense to protect that wealth through an accurate assessment of risk and proper insurance products. But knowing where one is at risk, which insurance products to buy and how much insurance is the right amount is indeed a tall order. Click here to learn more about this service >       Tax Planning   For High Net Worth Families  An increasingly complex and uncertain tax environment makes it difficult for affluent families to plan for the future. After all, taxation represents a significant variable in how much wealth a family retains versus renders to local, state and federal governments.  For many of our clients, taxes symbolize an X factor over which they feel they have little control. Click here to learn more about this service >       Charitable Planning    For The Causes That Matter To You  Most Americans who accumulate some level of wealth experience charitable impulses and want to give back. This can be a wonderful experience or very challenging. What determines the experience? Usually it is the presence of a charitable plan, not just good intentions. Click here to learn more about this service >       Estate Planning   To Make A Lasting Legacy  Estate planning is often a difficult topic to discuss because of what it suggests – end of life. Most people prefer not to think about this topic because it brings up a lot of emotions. Yet most people make decisions routinely that impact their estate, often without realizing it. Wise and compassionate family leaders, both patriarchs and matriarchs, choose a different path. Click here to learn more about this service >

What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)

Consensus Ratings for Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 10 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.77)Consensus Price Target: $52.58 (5.99% upside)

Insights For Business Owners, Executives And Affluent Families

   Why Your Wealth Advisor Needs A Tax Orientation Investment Returns Unlikely To Balance Out Poor Tax Decisions A friend of mine has been considering moving from California to Nevada’s Lake Tahoe region because he wanted a slower-paced lifestyle, fresh air and outdoor sports, far less traffic, and better overall quality of life.  But he overlooked the big pay-raise he was about to give himself from lower taxes.  Financial advice and tax strategies go together like fresh air and outdoor sports.  Here’s why. As a financial advisor with a Master of Science Degree in Taxation, I have come to realize that investment and tax advice must go hand-in-hand. If you get investment advice from one source and tax advice from another—and these two sources do not closely collaborate—you are very likely to miss substantial opportunities to grow your net worth.  Here are 4 reasons that wealth advice must be paired with tax-mitigation strategies.

Lessons Learned From Young Adult Financial Literacy Programs Recently, I heard a story about a young man from Chicago’s inner city. He was fortunate to participate in a program that matched him with a successful mentor. One day they rode the elevator to the conference floor at the top of the Chase Tower where the mentor worked. Upon arriving and looking out the window, the young man could not help but exclaim: “Wow! Chicago is so amazing! I’ve lived here my whole life, this is the first time I’ve seen my city as beautiful.” Before that mountaintop moment, all the young man had seen of Chicago was violence, poverty, and struggle. But that new view gave him hope for a brighter future. He suddenly saw what was out there in the world, as well as what might be possible for him personally. This caused me to ask myself – how am I impacting my clients so they have mountaintop moments and make a difference in the lives of others? Here are my perspectives.

How To Get Your Feet Back On The Ground Since 2009, the markets have made huge strides. While most investors still remember the pain of 2007 and 2008 when the markets were way down, as the markets have risen, those memories are fading. For some who are invested in the market today, it’s fun again with stock prices moving higher. Even so, many remain worried that the markets will go down again. Up. Up. Up. Down. Down. Down. It’s like a roller coaster. Emotional investors, those who make decisions based on short-term market swings, are often subjected to a difficult ride. When the markets go up, they feel better and buy. When the markets go down, they become more pessimistic and sell. Have you done this? Do you know someone who’s done this?

A few days ago, I was speaking with a client. She told me they had just returned from their vacation home after being with children and grandchildren. While playing Monopoly, a grandchild was trying to decide whether or not to put hotels on certain properties. Her husband said: “You better call Mia first. We never make decisions like that without her.” We both chuckled when she told me this story. But after thinking about it a while, I recalled how long it took me to build trust with this client. My name came up because I had guided them in making so many important decisions, none of which involved play-money. I took this as a compliment, a sign that I was doing my job.

There is no lack of information, or automated computer systems, available to help them make choices. Yet, as a seasoned financial advisor, my experience is that computer systems may help guide families and their advisors through the stages of wealth accumulation and wealth preservation. However, those systems are not nearly as effective for the final (and in many ways, most important) stage of wealth transfer.

Simply put, a family office approach reduces complexity by coordinating key family advisors, integrating disparate financial interests and aligning stakeholders to support critical family decisions. The result is that affluent families can focus on being a family instead of worrying about how their wealth is managed. But what exactly is a family office? The phrase “office” can have more than one meaning. Office can mean a set of rooms or a building where business is conducted. By this definition, a family office is simply the building where the business of your family is conducted.

Families With Complex Needs Deserve High-Touch Services “Family offices” are often thought of as the domain of the ultra-affluent. When people think of a family office, they often envision a team of highly skilled people, such as lawyers, CPAs and investment advisors, serving a single prominent American family, such as the Rockefellers. While this has been the common perception over the last several decades, a new trend is emerging. This trend is designed to serve a changing demographic. During the Baby Boomer and Gen X generations, the US witnessed a proliferation of wealth unlike ever before.

The idea is simple. Type in a few parameters about your life, income and goals and a computer system will produce a custom investment plan just for you. The computer becomes your advisor. The elegance of this approach is alluring. This type of guidance is particularly attractive to Millennials, those born between 1981 and 1997. Millennials grew up with more technology than any generation before them. So a computer-based advisor probably feels like a good fit for them. It feels natural. But there’s a problem, a hidden piece of the puzzle that might not be intuitive to Millennials.

Yet, I feel like it’s really important and something I can’t simply ignore. I hope you will receive my message in the spirit in which it is intended: ideas to provide comfort to your family and loved ones should something tragic take place. I started thinking about this topic recently because a friend of mine passed away. He was young, only in his 30s. He was in the prime of his life and had so much to look forward to. But in an instant, his life was over. His premature passing was completely unexpected and it devastated his family. I grew up with this guy and know his family really well. It has been very hard to watch them suffer.

I can certainly understand this. You and I could outline a litany of events that drain one’s confidence in the world as a good, safe and just place: terrorism, natural disasters, crime, political leaders who miss the mark and even scandals in the financial services industry. It would be easy to be discouraged. But I have come to believe that one’s outlook about the future is a choice. You get to decide what you believe about the future. This is a choice that only you can make. I do not discount or deny the bad things that exist in the world. They are very real. But the good things that exist in the world are very real too. Hopefully, the good things will outweigh the bad things.

Financial Guidance For Busy People I recently moved from condo living in downtown Chicago to a single-family dwelling in the suburbs. This included a number of life changes for me. I love being outdoors in our yard when the birds sing. I enjoy the smell of freshly mown grass. It’s comforting to hear the cicadas and see families spending time together. I have friendly neighbors who’ve welcomed us with smiles, handshakes and even home grown tomatoes. The suburbs really do seem to support quality family living. As much as I love my new life, there are many new demands on my time. Before moving, I daydreamed about all the hours I would spend reading under the pergola amongst the honeysuckle or playing board games as a family. That dream hasn’t quite come true.

Whether from the political left or right, the message seems to be the same. If you work hard, play by the rules, pay your taxes, live within your means, invest for the future – in other words if you do everything right – you still may not be able to achieve the American dream. The left likes to blame the one percenters. The right seems to suggest that somehow the entire system is rigged. Their message is that the odds are stacked against you, so why even try? The political candidates say, in so many words, vote for me and my party and we’ll fix it for you. We’ll give you back the dream. But do you really trust the government with your financial future?

The British pound, the Euro and all major stock markets declined sharply. While no one knows what the outcome will be, here is our perspective of the impact on the economy and markets.

The creature comforts are great. You don’t have to worry about money. Your parents typically can afford to invest in all sorts of things that help you achieve your potential, like private schools, personal tutors, music lessons, travel and even college tuition. But there is a challenge I’ve come to recognize after working with several children of affluent parents. Successful parents often cast a very long shadow. It can be quite difficult for the children of affluent parents to step out and chart their own course, to stand on their own two feet, so to speak. The measuring rod of anything they accomplish will always be their parents’ success. That can be a very long rod indeed.

According to the Exit Planning Institute’s Readiness Survey (2013), 75% of business owners “profoundly regretted” selling their business 12 months after the deal. To me, this is very sad to hear. I’m privileged to work with a select group of entrepreneurs and I know how much passion and energy they bring to their businesses. They pour their lives into these enterprises. They look forward to the day when all of their hard work will culminate in a transfer of equity to someone else. But all too often, that moment is followed by disappointment. Why?

Complexity In Your Financial Life May Require It I had a really great moment the other day with a client. We got together to talk about some updates to their plan and in so doing, I had a chance to think about how far this family had come. You see, they’ve been my client now for nearly 20 years. And in that space of time, we’ve seen tremendous changes in their lives and their financial situation. As I was driving away from our meeting, I couldn’t help but reflect on the differences between their financial situation today and where they were back then. This reminded me of the importance of having a plan and sticking to it over time. But that’s not the only thing I pondered.

In team sports, there are certain fundamental principles that come to life. Teamwork prevails over a star player. Execution matters more than raw talent. Experience comes with age. Defense wins championships. But the football season is now over and baseball is just around the corner. Not everyone finds baseball exciting, but I find myself exhilarated by the looming start of the season. Of course it doesn’t hurt that I’m a lifelong Cubs fan and we have a lot to be excited about.

I hear the concern in my clients’ voices during these conversations. Let’s be honest. The markets have been rough for quite some time now. This could last a while and no one can really say when things will improve. But I want to provide a perspective here that I think might help you see things in a different light. It wasn’t that long ago that we were facing a much more difficult market. The downturn of 2007 and 2008 are still fresh in the minds of many affluent investors. But people often seem to forget the very substantial recovery that followed. Funny isn’t it? We remember the pain of the losses, but so quickly seem to forget the joys of a rebounding market.

How Technology Is Changing The Way We Serve You I recently Googled “year-end tax planning” and got back 91 million results. Talk about overwhelming! Clearly, people are thinking about this topic. But the question becomes: what do you do with this information? How can you know which article is right for you? Do you need to read all 91 million articles to finally figure out which one has the best advice for your unique situation? This time of year there are an abundance of very useful tax tips and strategies for year-end. But here’s one you may not have heard. I recommend that you sit down with your advisor to look at the big picture and not just a set of uncorrelated tactics.

You might be considering gifts to family, charitable contributions, investments in tax-deferred accounts and other options. What you may not realize is that the taxation picture has become more complicated than it’s ever been with the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), the new tiers for capital gains rates and the new Medicare taxes on investment income.

Let’s call him Hal, which is not his real name. As an engineer, Hal had substantial wealth that he invested in the stock market. He watched the markets rise with glee. But in 2008 and 2009, when the markets tumbled, his emotions got the best of him and he sold everything. After the market rebounded, Hal did not reinvest. He felt burned from the volatility. Needless to say, within a year, Hal had huge regrets.

I watched the two of them struggle with a range of issues including custody of children, the emotional burden of the breakup and how to protect the adult daughter’s financial interests. Divorces are difficult and can drain a person’s energy and focus. This is where a parent can be a real help to their child, if the child is willing. In my experience, a parent can actually strengthen the bond with their child, and even their grandchildren, if the parent offers the right kind of support.

When I was a little girl, a bee stung me one summer day. I will never forget how much that hurt. In fact, as an adult, when I hear a bee flying by, I sometimes feel that sting again. This is what psychologists call phantom pains. The source of the pain might be gone, but the memory lingers. I have a sense that many people are struggling with their own type of phantom pain right now. The downturn of 2008 left people with a stinging sensation that is hard to forget. Any market volatility brings back those feelings.

In fact, I’ve been making a lot of phone calls over the last couple of weeks, speaking with our clients about their goals and how the market changes are impacting their financial standing. As I spend time with clients, I hear nervousness in people’s voices, and rightly so. The sting of the market declines from 2008 and 2009 are still very real for people.

She is the youngest of our three daughters. I’ll never forget the joy of that moment and the miracle of a new life, looking down into her tiny little face. What I didn’t know, at that time, is that 28 years later I would be in yet another hospital standing by Jacki’s side. But this time, I would be holding her hand as she lay in the intensive care unit of a hospital for 12 days, unable to speak or open her eyes as a result of a traumatic brain injury.

Key Considerations For Business Owners I’ve had the privilege of working with entrepreneurs to transition their business to others, and I’ve noticed a disturbing trend. Many business owners may be unprepared to transfer their business when the time comes to sell.

Interest rates are still pretty attractive compared to previous decades. In fact, today’s low interest rates provide some opportunities that may not come around again for a very long time, potentially in our lifetimes. What seems certain, at this point, is that interest rates will not remain low forever – in fact, they could start to trend higher yet this year. This raises some important questions. How can one take advantage of low interest rates? What strategies might work for your goals? What steps might you take now that might not be available or attractive in the coming months and years? Will you miss out on some great opportunities?

My clients may be thinking about a traditional retirement full of travel, hobbies and time with grandchildren - or simply wondering if they can stop working for the money and start working for more deeply fulfilling reasons. It is a real concern. Most of the families I’m privileged to serve are still building their wealth. They are earning incomes, saving and investing for the future. I can usually help these clients build a retirement plan based on some standard analyses and projections.

As he and ninety other veterans boarded the plane, he was surrounded by a group of volunteers who would take care of his every need for a long eighteen hour day.

Why You May Want A Partner For This Job When I sit down with clients today, I am hearing a consistent theme. A new thread is running through our conversations. It has little to do with investments, taxes, retirement or other topics that have traditionally been a focus. Instead, my clients who have adult children now often want to know how they can help those children adopt the financial disciplines that allowed the parents to achieve success. These parents know that their children will one-day inherit a large portion of wealth and they want them to be prepared to be good stewards of that wealth. This is not as easy as it may sound. Most of what needs to be “learned” cannot be taught in a classroom because it has to do with lifestyle, mindset, life-experiences and appetites.

It seems many closely-held, privately owned businesses do not have formal agreements in place to protect the business owners from unforeseen circumstances that could dramatically impact them and their families.  A high degree of personal trust and loyalty, handshake agreements, seem to suffice between partners.  I believe this is a mistake.  I’d like to share my perspectives with you.    Click here to read the full article >       By Robert Legan See All Articles From This Author > View Profile > Connect On LinkedIn >       The Five Biggest Mistakes People Make When Transferring A Family Business To The Next Generation How You Can Avoid These Costly Mistakes I’ve seen many families over the years grow successful companies that provide a great quality of life for the ones they love. Whitnell, in fact, was born out of a family business and still holds true to these roots. Serving families is an important part of our heritage and mission. While family businesses provide tremendous benefits, they also present challenges. One of the biggest challenges comes into play when a senior family member, often the primary equity holder and sometimes the founder, decides to retire. If the founder’s children have shown interest in the business, the founder often wants to transfer the business to them. This should be simple, right? I mean, the family owns the business. So it should be a straightforward private transaction, right?

I know it’s the holiday season because of what happens with my clients. The busy executives and business owners that I’m privileged to serve are often so busy during the year that I have to schedule meetings months in advance. The pace of work and life leaves them with little time for anything else. But during the holidays, somewhere around the third week of December, things start to change. People slow down a bit.

For family-owned businesses, especially those families where children are involved in the business, the retirement of the business founder can be a real conundrum.

Many years ago at another financial institution when I was first promoted into senior management, I began to notice a disturbing trend. Certain clients, whom I knew we were serving well and for whom we had delivered excellent performance, began to leave. The conversations often went something like this: “Bill we really like you and we like this company. But we’ve decided to move our accounts elsewhere.” When I enquired why, they would usually say something like: “you’ve taken good care of us and we appreciate that. But as a family we’ve begun looking at the long haul and who we can know and trust over many years. We have a lot of important decisions coming up and we need someone who really knows our situation. The problem is that our last two financial advisors did such a great job that they were promoted and we feel like we have to start over again. We just can’t do that anymore.
