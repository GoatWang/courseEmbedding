501® ORIGINAL
Started by us. Finished by you.

                        In 1873, workers who’d flocked to the American West in search of fortune needed pants that could work and endure, so Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis combined quality denim and rivet reinforcements, creating the first pair of blue jeans: the Levi’s® 501® Original.
                    
Shop Men
Shop Women










                        Created before the invention of the zipper, the signature button fly is a key detail which defines the 501® Jean,the perfect union of function and style.

                        The iconic Two Horse patch stitched on to the back of every pair of 501® Jeans illustrates the original promise made by Levi Strauss: “It’s no use, they can’t be ripped” and celebrates the strength and quality of the riveted denim.
                    











                        “It started out being purely functional. And became a style leader.”

                        "We're acutely aware of people customizing their jeans—making them a little bit tapered, taking a lot out of the leg and then vacuum-packing themselves into vintage Levi's®. That was really the beginning of the 501® Skinny."
                    
– JONATHAN CHEUNG, SVP DESIGN

                    “After hemming, tapering the leg of the 501® jeans is the most requested alteration in Levi’s® stores and tailor shops around the world, so we decided to do it for you, creating the 501® Taper and the perfect custom taper.”

Jean-Marc Levy Joins LRN as President, Ethics and Compliance Solutions and a Member of the Company's Executive Committee

Dec 09, 2014, 09:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   LRN 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Dec. 9, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- LRN, which helps organizations meet their compliance obligations, shape ethical behavior, and strengthen culture and leadership, announced today the hiring of Jean-Marc Levy, most recently Head of Global Issuer Services at the New York Stock Exchange, as President, Ethics and Compliance Solutions and a member of the executive committee. 
In his new role, Mr. Levy will be responsible for how LRN goes to market with its solutions, amplifies its insights and expertise, develops and expands partnerships, and grows the business through product innovation and corporate and commercial development.
"Jean-Marc's appointment underscores our long-term commitment to elevate our leadership position in the ethics and compliance marketplace," said Dov Seidman, founder and CEO of LRN. "He shares our passion for ethics and compliance, has a deep understanding of our industry and brings a substantive focus on what really differentiates great governance strategy and tactics -- from advising board members to educating employees. We are fortunate that Jean-Marc joins LRN at a time when companies and their leaders are increasingly rethinking their approaches to fostering 'do-it-right,' winning corporate cultures."
Mr. Levy joins LRN from Intercontinental Exchange | NYSE, where he served as Senior Vice President and Head of Global Issuer Services and oversaw NYSE Governance Services, a provider of corporate governance, risk, and ethics and compliance tools and services, to boards of directors and governance and compliance professionals. In his role he also oversaw NYSE's corporate services business, a portfolio of value-added services for investor relations, IPO, and capital markets professionals. Mr. Levy was also responsible for the identification and development of new business opportunities for NYSE's listings group and for the oversight of NYSE's investments in The Receivables Exchange and private placement platform ACE. 
Prior to Intercontinental Exchange | NYSE, Mr. Levy was a member of the founding senior management team of TheMarkets.com, an award winning provider of financial data, information, and workflow solutions to more than 2,400 institutional investment management firms and tens of thousands of analysts and portfolio managers worldwide, until the highly successful sale of the company to McGraw-Hill's Capital IQ division.
Reflecting on joining LRN, Mr. Levy added, "I'm honored and humbled to join LRN, an institution steeped in a history of and belief in doing the right thing, rooted in a mission and set of core values that serve as the moral and strategic compass for its passionate, inspired, and professional team.  LRN is committed to bringing leading solutions to its partners in a world where ethical behavior is the only winning behavior. I believe LRN is poised for growth, expansion and exciting innovation, and I am thrilled to be a part of its future." 
About LRN
Since 1994, LRN has helped over 20 million people at more than 700 companies, worldwide, simultaneously navigate complex legal and regulatory environments and foster ethical cultures. LRN's combination of practical tools, education and strategic advice helps companies translate their values into concrete corporate practices and leadership behaviors that create sustainable competitive advantage. In partnership with LRN, companies need not choose between living principles and maximizing profits, or between enhancing reputation and growing revenue: all are a product of principled performance. As a global company, LRN works with organizations in more than 100 countries, and has offices in major cities around the world including New York, Los Angeles, London, Mumbai and Paris.

About
People










Our People
LRN aspires to function as a Human Operating System, one in which success is achieved by unleashing and connecting the potential of many individuals, who each choose to work together on a single unifying mission. Rather than being coerced or motivated towards performance, Human Operating Systems create freedom to thrive for each contributor by ensuring that each is valued, supported and part of a system of mutual accountability. This focus on the human element is at the heart of LRN’s mission – Inspiring Principled Performance – and is the foundation of every service and solution we share with partners.
 








Leadership Councils
As a company we have chosen a model of self-governance rather than traditional hierarchy. People at all levels of the company are trusted to act on their own initiative and to collaboratively innovate; a shared purpose and common values guide employee and company behavior.








People & Principled Performance Council





The PPP focuses managing our day-to-day operations, determining our market strategy and execution and creating opportunities for our people to thrive. Above all, it is dedicated to ensuring that all of these objectives are met in a manner that reflects our HOW philosophy and mission to inspire principled performance, in close collaboration with the Living HOW Council.

 Career History



Director-Special Projects

                                    1994 - 2015                


British American Tobacco Plc


                  British American Tobacco

We are the world’s second largest quoted tobacco group by global market share, with brands sold in around 180 markets.

With more than 200 brands in our portfolio, we make the cigarette chosen by one in eight of the world’s one billion adult smokers. We hold robust market positions in each of our regions and have leadership in more than 50 markets. In 2011, our subsidiary companies sold 705 billion cigarettes.

In the same year, our subsidiaries enabled governments worldwide to gather more than £30 billion in taxes, including excise duty on our products, almost nine times the Group’s profit after tax.

We have sustained a significant global presence for over 100 years. Our business was founded in 1902 and by 1912 had become one of the world’s top dozen companies by market capitalisation.
People and factories

We have 46 cigarette factories in 39 countries. Eight of these plus one separate plant also make either cigarillos, roll your own or pipe tobacco. We also have a factory making smokeless snus.

We employ more than 55,000 people worldwide. Our workforce is strongly multi-cultural and we have a devolved structure, with each local company having wide freedom of action and responsibility for its operations. Decisions are made as close as possible to the local stakeholders of each business, within a framework of principles, standards, policies, strategies and delegated authorities.
Operating responsibly

We believe that because our products pose risks to health, it is all the more important that our business is managed responsibly. Responsibility is integral to our strategy and through dialogue with our stakeholders, we are working to pursue our commercial objectives in ways consistent with changing expectations of a modern tobacco business.
Tobacco growing

We are the only international tobacco group with a significant interest in tobacco leaf growing, working with thousands of farmers internationally. Our companies run leaf programmes providing direct agronomy support to farmers if it is not otherwise available, covering all aspects of crop production and environmental best practice - in 2011 our companies ran these in 19 countries. The Group purchased approximately 440,000 tonnes of leaf in 2011, grown by around 200,000 farmers.
What do our people say about us?

How our employees feel about working here is very important to us. We carry out a regular global employee opinion survey called Your Voice to give our people a secure and confidential way to tell us exactly what they think about working at British American Tobacco

                              of this meeting was born out during another one. The present authors were attending some colloquium among the numerous meetings
                              devoted to the endless discussion of the foundational problems of quantum theory, when it struck their minds that physics,
                              after all, was also an experimental science. Maybe, they thought to themselves, our very understanding ofquantum concepts
                              would gain from more thoroughly taking into account the impressive accumulation of modern experimental results on the fundamental
                              aspectsofquantum behaviour. Experiments once deemed as 'gedankenexperiments' now become routinely feasible, and far-ranging
                              progresses in the practical mastering of quantum phenomena have been accomplished in the recent years. The variety of domains
                              where quantum phenomena are currently investigated is extending beyond expectations, while their essential unity is ever more
                              obvious. As no physicist can seriously believe that "quantum" is the last word about Nature, thedrive tocheck thelimitsofvalidityofquantum
                              ideas is a powerful motive behind the everincreasing precisionofitsexperimental tests. Butno experimental fact up to now has
                              surfacedwhich seems tochallenge the main concepts of quantum theory. The robustness and reliabilityofquantum theory is all

501® ORIGINAL
Started by us. Finished by you.

                        In 1873, workers who’d flocked to the American West in search of fortune needed pants that could work and endure, so Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis combined quality denim and rivet reinforcements, creating the first pair of blue jeans: the Levi’s® 501® Original.

                        Created before the invention of the zipper, the signature button fly is a key detail which defines the 501® Jean,the perfect union of function and style.

                        The iconic Two Horse patch stitched on to the back of every pair of 501® Jeans illustrates the original promise made by Levi Strauss: “It’s no use, they can’t be ripped” and celebrates the strength and quality of the riveted denim.
                    











                        “It started out being purely functional. And became a style leader.”

                        "We're acutely aware of people customizing their jeans—making them a little bit tapered, taking a lot out of the leg and then vacuum-packing themselves into vintage Levi's®. That was really the beginning of the 501® Skinny."
                    
– JONATHAN CHEUNG, SVP DESIGN






























                    "Leaner and meaner than ever before."

                        Introduced to the world in 2015, the 501® Taper retains all the key elements of the 501® Original, now reimagined with a slightly more tailored look.
                    









                    “After hemming, tapering the leg of the 501® jeans is the most requested alteration in Levi’s® stores and tailor shops around the world, so we decided to do it for you, creating the 501® Taper and the perfect custom taper.”
