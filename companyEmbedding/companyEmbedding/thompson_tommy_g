Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is a United States Republican politician who was a state legislator in Wisconsin, and 42nd Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001, and is the longest serving governor in the state's history. During his term as governor he was the chairman of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001–05, appointed by George W. Bush. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson was a partner with the law-firm Akin Gump and Chairman of Deloitte's global healthcare practice and has served on the board of 22 other organizations.[1]
Thompson was a candidate for the U.S. Presidential election in 2008, though he withdrew from the race before the primaries.[2] In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in Wisconsin, hoping to replace retiring Democrat Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Tammy Baldwin, making it his first statewide loss.[3]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Childhood and family[edit]
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin.[4][5]
His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store.[6][7][8] His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in 2002.[9]
Education[edit]
Thompson earned his bachelor and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively.[4][5] While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.[10][11][12]
Vietnam and military service[edit]
Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966.[13] The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.[13]
After completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years.[14][15] His final rank was captain.[15]
Early political career (1966–1987)[edit]
Wisconsin Assembly[edit]
Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly.[13] In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.[13]
In 1973, Thompson became the Assembly's assistant minority leader and, in 1981, its minority leader.[16] Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname "Dr. No" by the frustrated majority.[17][18]
American Legislative Exchange Council[edit]
As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization.[19][20][21][22] Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: "I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I'd take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, 'That's mine.'"[19][20][21] ALEC awarded Thompson its "Thomas Jefferson Award" in 1991.[23]
1979 congressional election[edit]
While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin's 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack.[24] Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979.[25] Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.
Governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)[edit]
Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,141 days.[26]
Elections[edit]

1986

See also: United States gubernatorial elections, 1986; United States gubernatorial elections, 1990; United States gubernatorial elections, 1994; and United States gubernatorial elections, 1998
Thompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field.[27] He defeated Earl 53%–46%.[28]

1990

Thompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.[29]

1994

Thompson won election to a third term defeating Democrat State Senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.[30]

1998

Thompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.[31]
Tenure[edit]




Then-Governor Thompson meets President Bill Clinton, 1993


Thompson is best known nationally for pushing his state to overhaul its welfare system.[18] These reforms were implemented and pioneered before Congress and President Clinton undertook national reform of the program.[18] Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.[18] Thompson was called a "pioneer" for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers.[32][33] In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country's first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don't provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.[citation needed]
Thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.[34]
Thompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[18] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggested that "Many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare." Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[18]
The growth of the state budget during Thompson's 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.[35]
Transportation focus[edit]
While governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001[36][37][38] through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.[39]
Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans.[18] Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be Secretary of Transportation.[18]
Taxes[edit]
In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin.[13] Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987,[40] cutting income tax rates three times[41] and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.[42][43]
When Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he "never raised taxes", he earned a rating of "False" from PolitiFact-Wisconsin.[43] PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson's terms. Politifact said in its rating, "Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way." Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson's claim that Wisconsin's overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.[43]
Two of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor's partial-veto power, were taxes on the state's wealthiest residents.[13] In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy,[13] at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits.[13]
Executive power consolidation[edit]
As governor, Thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees.[13] Among the changes:

Consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the Wisconsin Department of Justice and transferred to Thompson's appointee at the Department of Agriculture
The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor had its budget greatly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.
Education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the move unconstitutional.[13]

Thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional.[13] His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional.[13] Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, "despite a clear ruling" from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.[13]
Tobacco[edit]
As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests.[18] His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris.[18] He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and "delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.[18]
Abortion[edit]
Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.[18]
Treatment of Ojibwa spearfishers[edit]
In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its "Voigt Decision", which found that Wisconsin's Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land.[44] The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.[44][45]
During his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa's rights.[44] Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million.[44] Thompson's administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the "Voigt Decision".[44] The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans' lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.[44]
In 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration's legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger.[45] Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992.[46] On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.[44]
Other leadership roles[edit]
During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States,[13] in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.
Vice presidential discussion[edit]
Thompson's name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.[13]
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position.[13] However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to "bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements", and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson's lack of finesse in their interactions.[13]
After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been "scared to death" of the process and the spotlight of the position.[47]
Health and Human Services Secretary[edit]




Thompson at the 2004 HealthierUS summit


Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001 Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004,[48] and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.
While Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,[48] reorganize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests and thereby provide health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans.[49] In the aftermath of 9–11 he also worked on strengthening the nation's preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.[50]
Key initiatives[edit]
Thompson's major initiatives were "efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes."[51]
Medicare prescription drug-benefit[edit]
Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush's Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush's first term, Thompson frequently served as the president's point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson's tenure as HHS secretary.[52]
As part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken.[53] In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.[54]
2001 anthrax scare[edit]
Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming "utterly overtaken by events" and issuing "early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts."[55]
At a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that "would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication."[56] Thompson offered the media a "far-fetched" suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.[57] Thompson's words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, potentially undermining public confidence, and as the "kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts."[58][59] Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.[56]
Politicizing of science[edit]
In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson's office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit's director.[60] In return, Thompson's office sent back to the unit's director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as "lightweights" with "no scientific credibility." Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having "signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush."[61] This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a "politicization of science" under President George W. Bush's administration.[62][63]
Resignation press conference[edit]
Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists.[51] Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President's reelection at the administration's request.[64][65][66] Some noted, in particular, his words: "I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that."[51]
Post-government career[edit]
After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.[1][67]
Thompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.[68]
In 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson's consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson's work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.[68]
A number of those companies and organizations "he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors." An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that "either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight."[68]
Health care consulting and Law Firm[edit]
Thompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying.[1] There, Thompson provided "strategic advice" to the lobbyists in the firm's health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm's clients.[1]
He also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Care Management and Transformation.[67][69] Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.[67]
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Thompson endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[70]
ADS board membership[edit]
Shortly after leaving his Bush Cabinet post, Thompson joined and served for two years on the board of directors of Applied Digital Solutions, makers of the controversial VeriChip: a glass-encapsulated RFID chip that can be injected into human flesh for various database-driven identification purposes.[71] The FDA issued approval to the device while its parent agency, DHHS, was headed by Thompson, who became a board member of ADS within five months. He received shares of stock in ADS, and compensation, leading the non-profit advocacy group Project on Government Oversight to characterize Thompson's actions "unacceptable" and embarrassing, although unfortunately entirely legal.[71]
Medicare[edit]
After leaving office, Thompson began offering policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary.[72] However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions).[72] These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.[72]
Public interest activities[edit]
Thompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Kennedy School of Government conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy.[73] Thompson also authored a Boston Globe op-ed on the topic.[74]
One of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, Plain Talk about Health.[75]
2008 Presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Tommy Thompson presidential campaign, 2008
After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.[76]
Statement about sexual orientation and workplace protections[edit]
During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker.[77] He said, "I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be." He called CNN the following morning to say he did not hear the question correctly. He apologized, saying, "It's not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace."
Political contributions[edit]
Thompson made campaign contributions to two Democrats in 2008[78] – $250 to Michigan Senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for Governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year's elections. All told, Thompson contributed $11,350 to Republican candidates for federal office in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles, while contributing another $4,900 to Wisconsin Republicans during those same cycles.
Gaffe about Jews, Israel[edit]


“
I'm in the private sector and for the first time in my life I'm earning money. You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that. [...]
I just want to clarify something because I didn't in any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.
”


— Tommy Thompson, address to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism – Consultation on Conscience, Washington, DC, April 16, 2007




“
Thompson was courting public support, not trying to alienate people—which means he somehow believed that repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners! There could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes have become.
”


— Abraham Foxman, National Director, Anti-Defamation League, Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype (Macmillan, 2010, p. 139)


In April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.[79]
On April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector[80][81] and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance.[82] Thompson stated: "You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that."[81] Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments,[83] adding: "I just want to clarify something because I didn't (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that."[81] Thompson's comments caused "unease in the room" as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson's use of this stereotype.[80][82]
Thompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as "Jewish bonds".[80][84][85] He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group[80][84]
Conference organizers noted the unease with Thompson's words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.[86]
The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that "there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become" than Thompson's belief that "repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!"[82]
After the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold.[79] Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.[80][84]
Iowa Straw Poll[edit]
Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race.[citation needed]
Endorses Giuliani[edit]
In October 2007, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that "Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership." He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani's withdrawal from the presidential race.[87] In a New York Times article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain's campaign as saying, "No. I don't know who is."[88]
2012 U.S. Senate election[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2012
On September 19, 2011; Thompson announced he would run for the seat vacated by Sen. Herb Kohl,[89] formally announcing on December 1, 2011. He won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012 after a bitter four-way primary battle against a field which included millionaire hedge fund manager Eric Hovde, former Congressman Mark Neumann and Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.[90]
The attacks on Thompson led to his defense and endorsement by former Arkansas governor, presidential candidate, and conservative media figure Mike Huckabee.[91]
ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson's bid for US Senate in the autumn of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, taking 45.9 percent to Baldwin's 51.5 percent. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state's two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.[citation needed]
Political positions[edit]
During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, "who better than me, that’s already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?"[92] When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare, but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.[92]
Thompson favors making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15 percent flat tax.[93]

Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is a United States Republican politician who was a state legislator in Wisconsin, and 42nd Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001, and is the longest serving governor in the state's history. During his term as governor he was the chairman of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001–05, appointed by George W. Bush. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson was a partner with the law-firm Akin Gump and Chairman of Deloitte's global healthcare practice and has served on the board of 22 other organizations.[1]
Thompson was a candidate for the U.S. Presidential election in 2008, though he withdrew from the race before the primaries.[2] In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in Wisconsin, hoping to replace retiring Democrat Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Tammy Baldwin, making it his first statewide loss.[3]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Childhood and family[edit]
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin.[4][5]
His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store.[6][7][8] His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in 2002.[9]
Education[edit]
Thompson earned his bachelor and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively.[4][5] While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.[10][11][12]
Vietnam and military service[edit]
Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966.[13] The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.[13]
After completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years.[14][15] His final rank was captain.[15]
Early political career (1966–1987)[edit]
Wisconsin Assembly[edit]
Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly.[13] In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.[13]
In 1973, Thompson became the Assembly's assistant minority leader and, in 1981, its minority leader.[16] Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname "Dr. No" by the frustrated majority.[17][18]
American Legislative Exchange Council[edit]
As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization.[19][20][21][22] Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: "I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I'd take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, 'That's mine.'"[19][20][21] ALEC awarded Thompson its "Thomas Jefferson Award" in 1991.[23]
1979 congressional election[edit]
While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin's 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack.[24] Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979.[25] Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.
Governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)[edit]
Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,141 days.[26]
Elections[edit]

1986

See also: United States gubernatorial elections, 1986; United States gubernatorial elections, 1990; United States gubernatorial elections, 1994; and United States gubernatorial elections, 1998
Thompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field.[27] He defeated Earl 53%–46%.[28]

1990

Thompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.[29]

1994

Thompson won election to a third term defeating Democrat State Senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.[30]

1998

Thompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.[31]
Tenure[edit]




Then-Governor Thompson meets President Bill Clinton, 1993


Thompson is best known nationally for pushing his state to overhaul its welfare system.[18] These reforms were implemented and pioneered before Congress and President Clinton undertook national reform of the program.[18] Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.[18] Thompson was called a "pioneer" for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers.[32][33] In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country's first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don't provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.[citation needed]
Thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.[34]
Thompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[18] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggested that "Many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare." Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[18]
The growth of the state budget during Thompson's 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.[35]
Transportation focus[edit]
While governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001[36][37][38] through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.[39]
Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans.[18] Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be Secretary of Transportation.[18]
Taxes[edit]
In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin.[13] Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987,[40] cutting income tax rates three times[41] and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.[42][43]
When Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he "never raised taxes", he earned a rating of "False" from PolitiFact-Wisconsin.[43] PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson's terms. Politifact said in its rating, "Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way." Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson's claim that Wisconsin's overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.[43]
Two of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor's partial-veto power, were taxes on the state's wealthiest residents.[13] In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy,[13] at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits.[13]
Executive power consolidation[edit]
As governor, Thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees.[13] Among the changes:

Consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the Wisconsin Department of Justice and transferred to Thompson's appointee at the Department of Agriculture
The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor had its budget greatly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.
Education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the move unconstitutional.[13]

Thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional.[13] His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional.[13] Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, "despite a clear ruling" from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.[13]
Tobacco[edit]
As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests.[18] His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris.[18] He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and "delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.[18]
Abortion[edit]
Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.[18]
Treatment of Ojibwa spearfishers[edit]
In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its "Voigt Decision", which found that Wisconsin's Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land.[44] The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.[44][45]
During his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa's rights.[44] Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million.[44] Thompson's administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the "Voigt Decision".[44] The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans' lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.[44]
In 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration's legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger.[45] Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992.[46] On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.[44]
Other leadership roles[edit]
During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States,[13] in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.
Vice presidential discussion[edit]
Thompson's name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.[13]
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position.[13] However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to "bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements", and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson's lack of finesse in their interactions.[13]
After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been "scared to death" of the process and the spotlight of the position.[47]
Health and Human Services Secretary[edit]




Thompson at the 2004 HealthierUS summit


Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001 Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004,[48] and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.
While Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,[48] reorganize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests and thereby provide health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans.[49] In the aftermath of 9–11 he also worked on strengthening the nation's preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.[50]
Key initiatives[edit]
Thompson's major initiatives were "efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes."[51]
Medicare prescription drug-benefit[edit]
Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush's Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush's first term, Thompson frequently served as the president's point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson's tenure as HHS secretary.[52]
As part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken.[53] In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.[54]
2001 anthrax scare[edit]
Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming "utterly overtaken by events" and issuing "early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts."[55]
At a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that "would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication."[56] Thompson offered the media a "far-fetched" suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.[57] Thompson's words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, potentially undermining public confidence, and as the "kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts."[58][59] Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.[56]
Politicizing of science[edit]
In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson's office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit's director.[60] In return, Thompson's office sent back to the unit's director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as "lightweights" with "no scientific credibility." Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having "signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush."[61] This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a "politicization of science" under President George W. Bush's administration.[62][63]
Resignation press conference[edit]
Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists.[51] Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President's reelection at the administration's request.[64][65][66] Some noted, in particular, his words: "I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that."[51]
Post-government career[edit]
After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.[1][67]
Thompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.[68]
In 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson's consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson's work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.[68]
A number of those companies and organizations "he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors." An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that "either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight."[68]
Health care consulting and Law Firm[edit]
Thompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying.[1] There, Thompson provided "strategic advice" to the lobbyists in the firm's health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm's clients.[1]
He also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Care Management and Transformation.[67][69] Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.[67]
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Thompson endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[70]
ADS board membership[edit]
Shortly after leaving his Bush Cabinet post, Thompson joined and served for two years on the board of directors of Applied Digital Solutions, makers of the controversial VeriChip: a glass-encapsulated RFID chip that can be injected into human flesh for various database-driven identification purposes.[71] The FDA issued approval to the device while its parent agency, DHHS, was headed by Thompson, who became a board member of ADS within five months. He received shares of stock in ADS, and compensation, leading the non-profit advocacy group Project on Government Oversight to characterize Thompson's actions "unacceptable" and embarrassing, although unfortunately entirely legal.[71]
Medicare[edit]
After leaving office, Thompson began offering policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary.[72] However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions).[72] These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.[72]
Public interest activities[edit]
Thompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Kennedy School of Government conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy.[73] Thompson also authored a Boston Globe op-ed on the topic.[74]
One of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, Plain Talk about Health.[75]
2008 Presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Tommy Thompson presidential campaign, 2008
After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.[76]
Statement about sexual orientation and workplace protections[edit]
During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker.[77] He said, "I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be." He called CNN the following morning to say he did not hear the question correctly. He apologized, saying, "It's not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace."
Political contributions[edit]
Thompson made campaign contributions to two Democrats in 2008[78] – $250 to Michigan Senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for Governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year's elections. All told, Thompson contributed $11,350 to Republican candidates for federal office in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles, while contributing another $4,900 to Wisconsin Republicans during those same cycles.
Gaffe about Jews, Israel[edit]


“
I'm in the private sector and for the first time in my life I'm earning money. You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that. [...]
I just want to clarify something because I didn't in any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.
”


— Tommy Thompson, address to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism – Consultation on Conscience, Washington, DC, April 16, 2007




“
Thompson was courting public support, not trying to alienate people—which means he somehow believed that repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners! There could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes have become.
”


— Abraham Foxman, National Director, Anti-Defamation League, Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype (Macmillan, 2010, p. 139)


In April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.[79]
On April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector[80][81] and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance.[82] Thompson stated: "You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that."[81] Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments,[83] adding: "I just want to clarify something because I didn't (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that."[81] Thompson's comments caused "unease in the room" as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson's use of this stereotype.[80][82]
Thompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as "Jewish bonds".[80][84][85] He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group[80][84]
Conference organizers noted the unease with Thompson's words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.[86]
The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that "there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become" than Thompson's belief that "repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!"[82]
After the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold.[79] Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.[80][84]
Iowa Straw Poll[edit]
Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race.[citation needed]
Endorses Giuliani[edit]
In October 2007, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that "Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership." He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani's withdrawal from the presidential race.[87] In a New York Times article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain's campaign as saying, "No. I don't know who is."[88]
2012 U.S. Senate election[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2012
On September 19, 2011; Thompson announced he would run for the seat vacated by Sen. Herb Kohl,[89] formally announcing on December 1, 2011. He won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012 after a bitter four-way primary battle against a field which included millionaire hedge fund manager Eric Hovde, former Congressman Mark Neumann and Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.[90]
The attacks on Thompson led to his defense and endorsement by former Arkansas governor, presidential candidate, and conservative media figure Mike Huckabee.[91]
ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson's bid for US Senate in the autumn of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, taking 45.9 percent to Baldwin's 51.5 percent. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state's two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.[citation needed]
Political positions[edit]
During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, "who better than me, that’s already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?"[92] When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare, but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.[92]
Thompson favors making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15 percent flat tax.[93]

Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is a United States Republican politician who was a state legislator in Wisconsin, and 42nd Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001, and is the longest serving governor in the state's history. During his term as governor he was the chairman of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001–05, appointed by George W. Bush. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson was a partner with the law-firm Akin Gump and Chairman of Deloitte's global healthcare practice and has served on the board of 22 other organizations.[1]
Thompson was a candidate for the U.S. Presidential election in 2008, though he withdrew from the race before the primaries.[2] In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in Wisconsin, hoping to replace retiring Democrat Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Tammy Baldwin, making it his first statewide loss.[3]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Childhood and family[edit]
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin.[4][5]
His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store.[6][7][8] His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in 2002.[9]
Education[edit]
Thompson earned his bachelor and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively.[4][5] While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.[10][11][12]
Vietnam and military service[edit]
Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966.[13] The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.[13]
After completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years.[14][15] His final rank was captain.[15]
Early political career (1966–1987)[edit]
Wisconsin Assembly[edit]
Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly.[13] In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.[13]
In 1973, Thompson became the Assembly's assistant minority leader and, in 1981, its minority leader.[16] Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname "Dr. No" by the frustrated majority.[17][18]
American Legislative Exchange Council[edit]
As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization.[19][20][21][22] Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: "I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I'd take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, 'That's mine.'"[19][20][21] ALEC awarded Thompson its "Thomas Jefferson Award" in 1991.[23]
1979 congressional election[edit]
While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin's 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack.[24] Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979.[25] Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.
Governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)[edit]
Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,141 days.[26]
Elections[edit]

1986

See also: United States gubernatorial elections, 1986; United States gubernatorial elections, 1990; United States gubernatorial elections, 1994; and United States gubernatorial elections, 1998
Thompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field.[27] He defeated Earl 53%–46%.[28]

1990

Thompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.[29]

1994

Thompson won election to a third term defeating Democrat State Senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.[30]

1998

Thompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.[31]
Tenure[edit]




Then-Governor Thompson meets President Bill Clinton, 1993


Thompson is best known nationally for pushing his state to overhaul its welfare system.[18] These reforms were implemented and pioneered before Congress and President Clinton undertook national reform of the program.[18] Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.[18] Thompson was called a "pioneer" for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers.[32][33] In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country's first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don't provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.[citation needed]
Thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.[34]
Thompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[18] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggested that "Many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare." Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[18]
The growth of the state budget during Thompson's 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.[35]
Transportation focus[edit]
While governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001[36][37][38] through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.[39]
Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans.[18] Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be Secretary of Transportation.[18]
Taxes[edit]
In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin.[13] Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987,[40] cutting income tax rates three times[41] and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.[42][43]
When Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he "never raised taxes", he earned a rating of "False" from PolitiFact-Wisconsin.[43] PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson's terms. Politifact said in its rating, "Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way." Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson's claim that Wisconsin's overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.[43]
Two of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor's partial-veto power, were taxes on the state's wealthiest residents.[13] In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy,[13] at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits.[13]
Executive power consolidation[edit]
As governor, Thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees.[13] Among the changes:

Consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the Wisconsin Department of Justice and transferred to Thompson's appointee at the Department of Agriculture
The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor had its budget greatly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.
Education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the move unconstitutional.[13]

Thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional.[13] His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional.[13] Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, "despite a clear ruling" from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.[13]
Tobacco[edit]
As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests.[18] His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris.[18] He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and "delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.[18]
Abortion[edit]
Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.[18]
Treatment of Ojibwa spearfishers[edit]
In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its "Voigt Decision", which found that Wisconsin's Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land.[44] The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.[44][45]
During his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa's rights.[44] Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million.[44] Thompson's administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the "Voigt Decision".[44] The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans' lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.[44]
In 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration's legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger.[45] Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992.[46] On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.[44]
Other leadership roles[edit]
During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States,[13] in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.
Vice presidential discussion[edit]
Thompson's name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.[13]
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position.[13] However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to "bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements", and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson's lack of finesse in their interactions.[13]
After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been "scared to death" of the process and the spotlight of the position.[47]
Health and Human Services Secretary[edit]




Thompson at the 2004 HealthierUS summit


Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001 Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004,[48] and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.
While Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,[48] reorganize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests and thereby provide health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans.[49] In the aftermath of 9–11 he also worked on strengthening the nation's preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.[50]
Key initiatives[edit]
Thompson's major initiatives were "efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes."[51]
Medicare prescription drug-benefit[edit]
Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush's Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush's first term, Thompson frequently served as the president's point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson's tenure as HHS secretary.[52]
As part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken.[53] In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.[54]
2001 anthrax scare[edit]
Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming "utterly overtaken by events" and issuing "early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts."[55]
At a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that "would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication."[56] Thompson offered the media a "far-fetched" suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.[57] Thompson's words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, potentially undermining public confidence, and as the "kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts."[58][59] Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.[56]
Politicizing of science[edit]
In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson's office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit's director.[60] In return, Thompson's office sent back to the unit's director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as "lightweights" with "no scientific credibility." Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having "signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush."[61] This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a "politicization of science" under President George W. Bush's administration.[62][63]
Resignation press conference[edit]
Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists.[51] Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President's reelection at the administration's request.[64][65][66] Some noted, in particular, his words: "I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that."[51]
Post-government career[edit]
After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.[1][67]
Thompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.[68]
In 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson's consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson's work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.[68]
A number of those companies and organizations "he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors." An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that "either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight."[68]
Health care consulting and Law Firm[edit]
Thompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying.[1] There, Thompson provided "strategic advice" to the lobbyists in the firm's health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm's clients.[1]
He also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Care Management and Transformation.[67][69] Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.[67]
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Thompson endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[70]
ADS board membership[edit]
Shortly after leaving his Bush Cabinet post, Thompson joined and served for two years on the board of directors of Applied Digital Solutions, makers of the controversial VeriChip: a glass-encapsulated RFID chip that can be injected into human flesh for various database-driven identification purposes.[71] The FDA issued approval to the device while its parent agency, DHHS, was headed by Thompson, who became a board member of ADS within five months. He received shares of stock in ADS, and compensation, leading the non-profit advocacy group Project on Government Oversight to characterize Thompson's actions "unacceptable" and embarrassing, although unfortunately entirely legal.[71]
Medicare[edit]
After leaving office, Thompson began offering policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary.[72] However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions).[72] These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.[72]
Public interest activities[edit]
Thompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Kennedy School of Government conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy.[73] Thompson also authored a Boston Globe op-ed on the topic.[74]
One of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, Plain Talk about Health.[75]
2008 Presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Tommy Thompson presidential campaign, 2008
After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.[76]
Statement about sexual orientation and workplace protections[edit]
During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker.[77] He said, "I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be." He called CNN the following morning to say he did not hear the question correctly. He apologized, saying, "It's not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace."
Political contributions[edit]
Thompson made campaign contributions to two Democrats in 2008[78] – $250 to Michigan Senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for Governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year's elections. All told, Thompson contributed $11,350 to Republican candidates for federal office in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles, while contributing another $4,900 to Wisconsin Republicans during those same cycles.
Gaffe about Jews, Israel[edit]


“
I'm in the private sector and for the first time in my life I'm earning money. You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that. [...]
I just want to clarify something because I didn't in any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.
”


— Tommy Thompson, address to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism – Consultation on Conscience, Washington, DC, April 16, 2007




“
Thompson was courting public support, not trying to alienate people—which means he somehow believed that repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners! There could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes have become.
”


— Abraham Foxman, National Director, Anti-Defamation League, Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype (Macmillan, 2010, p. 139)


In April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.[79]
On April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector[80][81] and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance.[82] Thompson stated: "You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that."[81] Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments,[83] adding: "I just want to clarify something because I didn't (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that."[81] Thompson's comments caused "unease in the room" as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson's use of this stereotype.[80][82]
Thompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as "Jewish bonds".[80][84][85] He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group[80][84]
Conference organizers noted the unease with Thompson's words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.[86]
The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that "there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become" than Thompson's belief that "repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!"[82]
After the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold.[79] Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.[80][84]
Iowa Straw Poll[edit]
Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race.[citation needed]
Endorses Giuliani[edit]
In October 2007, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that "Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership." He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani's withdrawal from the presidential race.[87] In a New York Times article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain's campaign as saying, "No. I don't know who is."[88]
2012 U.S. Senate election[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2012
On September 19, 2011; Thompson announced he would run for the seat vacated by Sen. Herb Kohl,[89] formally announcing on December 1, 2011. He won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012 after a bitter four-way primary battle against a field which included millionaire hedge fund manager Eric Hovde, former Congressman Mark Neumann and Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.[90]
The attacks on Thompson led to his defense and endorsement by former Arkansas governor, presidential candidate, and conservative media figure Mike Huckabee.[91]
ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson's bid for US Senate in the autumn of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, taking 45.9 percent to Baldwin's 51.5 percent. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state's two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.[citation needed]
Political positions[edit]
During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, "who better than me, that’s already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?"[92] When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare, but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.[92]
Thompson favors making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15 percent flat tax.[93]

Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is a United States Republican politician who was a state legislator in Wisconsin, and 42nd Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001, and is the longest serving governor in the state's history. During his term as governor he was the chairman of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001–05, appointed by George W. Bush. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson was a partner with the law-firm Akin Gump and Chairman of Deloitte's global healthcare practice and has served on the board of 22 other organizations.[1]
Thompson was a candidate for the U.S. Presidential election in 2008, though he withdrew from the race before the primaries.[2] In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in Wisconsin, hoping to replace retiring Democrat Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Tammy Baldwin, making it his first statewide loss.[3]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Childhood and family[edit]
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin.[4][5]
His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store.[6][7][8] His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in 2002.[9]
Education[edit]
Thompson earned his bachelor and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively.[4][5] While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.[10][11][12]
Vietnam and military service[edit]
Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966.[13] The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.[13]
After completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years.[14][15] His final rank was captain.[15]
Early political career (1966–1987)[edit]
Wisconsin Assembly[edit]
Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly.[13] In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.[13]
In 1973, Thompson became the Assembly's assistant minority leader and, in 1981, its minority leader.[16] Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname "Dr. No" by the frustrated majority.[17][18]
American Legislative Exchange Council[edit]
As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization.[19][20][21][22] Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: "I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I'd take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, 'That's mine.'"[19][20][21] ALEC awarded Thompson its "Thomas Jefferson Award" in 1991.[23]
1979 congressional election[edit]
While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin's 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack.[24] Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979.[25] Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.
Governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)[edit]
Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,141 days.[26]
Elections[edit]

1986

See also: United States gubernatorial elections, 1986; United States gubernatorial elections, 1990; United States gubernatorial elections, 1994; and United States gubernatorial elections, 1998
Thompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field.[27] He defeated Earl 53%–46%.[28]

1990

Thompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.[29]

1994

Thompson won election to a third term defeating Democrat State Senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.[30]

1998

Thompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.[31]
Tenure[edit]




Then-Governor Thompson meets President Bill Clinton, 1993


Thompson is best known nationally for pushing his state to overhaul its welfare system.[18] These reforms were implemented and pioneered before Congress and President Clinton undertook national reform of the program.[18] Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.[18] Thompson was called a "pioneer" for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers.[32][33] In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country's first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don't provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.[citation needed]
Thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.[34]
Thompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[18] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggested that "Many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare." Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[18]
The growth of the state budget during Thompson's 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.[35]
Transportation focus[edit]
While governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001[36][37][38] through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.[39]
Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans.[18] Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be Secretary of Transportation.[18]
Taxes[edit]
In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin.[13] Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987,[40] cutting income tax rates three times[41] and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.[42][43]
When Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he "never raised taxes", he earned a rating of "False" from PolitiFact-Wisconsin.[43] PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson's terms. Politifact said in its rating, "Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way." Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson's claim that Wisconsin's overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.[43]
Two of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor's partial-veto power, were taxes on the state's wealthiest residents.[13] In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy,[13] at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits.[13]
Executive power consolidation[edit]
As governor, Thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees.[13] Among the changes:

Consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the Wisconsin Department of Justice and transferred to Thompson's appointee at the Department of Agriculture
The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor had its budget greatly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.
Education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the move unconstitutional.[13]

Thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional.[13] His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional.[13] Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, "despite a clear ruling" from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.[13]
Tobacco[edit]
As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests.[18] His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris.[18] He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and "delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.[18]
Abortion[edit]
Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.[18]
Treatment of Ojibwa spearfishers[edit]
In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its "Voigt Decision", which found that Wisconsin's Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land.[44] The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.[44][45]
During his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa's rights.[44] Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million.[44] Thompson's administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the "Voigt Decision".[44] The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans' lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.[44]
In 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration's legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger.[45] Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992.[46] On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.[44]
Other leadership roles[edit]
During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States,[13] in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.
Vice presidential discussion[edit]
Thompson's name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.[13]
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position.[13] However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to "bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements", and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson's lack of finesse in their interactions.[13]
After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been "scared to death" of the process and the spotlight of the position.[47]
Health and Human Services Secretary[edit]




Thompson at the 2004 HealthierUS summit


Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001 Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004,[48] and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.
While Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,[48] reorganize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests and thereby provide health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans.[49] In the aftermath of 9–11 he also worked on strengthening the nation's preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.[50]
Key initiatives[edit]
Thompson's major initiatives were "efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes."[51]
Medicare prescription drug-benefit[edit]
Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush's Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush's first term, Thompson frequently served as the president's point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson's tenure as HHS secretary.[52]
As part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken.[53] In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.[54]
2001 anthrax scare[edit]
Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming "utterly overtaken by events" and issuing "early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts."[55]
At a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that "would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication."[56] Thompson offered the media a "far-fetched" suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.[57] Thompson's words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, potentially undermining public confidence, and as the "kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts."[58][59] Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.[56]
Politicizing of science[edit]
In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson's office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit's director.[60] In return, Thompson's office sent back to the unit's director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as "lightweights" with "no scientific credibility." Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having "signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush."[61] This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a "politicization of science" under President George W. Bush's administration.[62][63]
Resignation press conference[edit]
Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists.[51] Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President's reelection at the administration's request.[64][65][66] Some noted, in particular, his words: "I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that."[51]
Post-government career[edit]
After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.[1][67]
Thompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.[68]
In 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson's consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson's work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.[68]
A number of those companies and organizations "he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors." An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that "either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight."[68]
Health care consulting and Law Firm[edit]
Thompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying.[1] There, Thompson provided "strategic advice" to the lobbyists in the firm's health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm's clients.[1]
He also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Care Management and Transformation.[67][69] Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.[67]
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Thompson endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[70]
ADS board membership[edit]
Shortly after leaving his Bush Cabinet post, Thompson joined and served for two years on the board of directors of Applied Digital Solutions, makers of the controversial VeriChip: a glass-encapsulated RFID chip that can be injected into human flesh for various database-driven identification purposes.[71] The FDA issued approval to the device while its parent agency, DHHS, was headed by Thompson, who became a board member of ADS within five months. He received shares of stock in ADS, and compensation, leading the non-profit advocacy group Project on Government Oversight to characterize Thompson's actions "unacceptable" and embarrassing, although unfortunately entirely legal.[71]
Medicare[edit]
After leaving office, Thompson began offering policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary.[72] However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions).[72] These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.[72]
Public interest activities[edit]
Thompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Kennedy School of Government conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy.[73] Thompson also authored a Boston Globe op-ed on the topic.[74]
One of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, Plain Talk about Health.[75]
2008 Presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Tommy Thompson presidential campaign, 2008
After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.[76]
Statement about sexual orientation and workplace protections[edit]
During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker.[77] He said, "I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be." He called CNN the following morning to say he did not hear the question correctly. He apologized, saying, "It's not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace."
Political contributions[edit]
Thompson made campaign contributions to two Democrats in 2008[78] – $250 to Michigan Senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for Governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year's elections. All told, Thompson contributed $11,350 to Republican candidates for federal office in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles, while contributing another $4,900 to Wisconsin Republicans during those same cycles.
Gaffe about Jews, Israel[edit]


“
I'm in the private sector and for the first time in my life I'm earning money. You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that. [...]
I just want to clarify something because I didn't in any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.
”


— Tommy Thompson, address to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism – Consultation on Conscience, Washington, DC, April 16, 2007




“
Thompson was courting public support, not trying to alienate people—which means he somehow believed that repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners! There could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes have become.
”


— Abraham Foxman, National Director, Anti-Defamation League, Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype (Macmillan, 2010, p. 139)


In April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.[79]
On April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector[80][81] and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance.[82] Thompson stated: "You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that."[81] Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments,[83] adding: "I just want to clarify something because I didn't (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that."[81] Thompson's comments caused "unease in the room" as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson's use of this stereotype.[80][82]
Thompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as "Jewish bonds".[80][84][85] He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group[80][84]
Conference organizers noted the unease with Thompson's words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.[86]
The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that "there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become" than Thompson's belief that "repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!"[82]
After the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold.[79] Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.[80][84]
Iowa Straw Poll[edit]
Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race.[citation needed]
Endorses Giuliani[edit]
In October 2007, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that "Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership." He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani's withdrawal from the presidential race.[87] In a New York Times article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain's campaign as saying, "No. I don't know who is."[88]
2012 U.S. Senate election[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2012
On September 19, 2011; Thompson announced he would run for the seat vacated by Sen. Herb Kohl,[89] formally announcing on December 1, 2011. He won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012 after a bitter four-way primary battle against a field which included millionaire hedge fund manager Eric Hovde, former Congressman Mark Neumann and Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.[90]
The attacks on Thompson led to his defense and endorsement by former Arkansas governor, presidential candidate, and conservative media figure Mike Huckabee.[91]
ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson's bid for US Senate in the autumn of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, taking 45.9 percent to Baldwin's 51.5 percent. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state's two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.[citation needed]
Political positions[edit]
During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, "who better than me, that’s already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?"[92] When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare, but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.[92]
Thompson favors making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15 percent flat tax.[93]

Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is a United States Republican politician who was a state legislator in Wisconsin, and 42nd Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001, and is the longest serving governor in the state's history. During his term as governor he was the chairman of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001–05, appointed by George W. Bush. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson was a partner with the law-firm Akin Gump and Chairman of Deloitte's global healthcare practice and has served on the board of 22 other organizations.[1]
Thompson was a candidate for the U.S. Presidential election in 2008, though he withdrew from the race before the primaries.[2] In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in Wisconsin, hoping to replace retiring Democrat Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Tammy Baldwin, making it his first statewide loss.[3]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Childhood and family[edit]
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin.[4][5]
His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store.[6][7][8] His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in 2002.[9]
Education[edit]
Thompson earned his bachelor and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively.[4][5] While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.[10][11][12]
Vietnam and military service[edit]
Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966.[13] The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.[13]
After completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years.[14][15] His final rank was captain.[15]
Early political career (1966–1987)[edit]
Wisconsin Assembly[edit]
Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly.[13] In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.[13]
In 1973, Thompson became the Assembly's assistant minority leader and, in 1981, its minority leader.[16] Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname "Dr. No" by the frustrated majority.[17][18]
American Legislative Exchange Council[edit]
As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization.[19][20][21][22] Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: "I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I'd take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, 'That's mine.'"[19][20][21] ALEC awarded Thompson its "Thomas Jefferson Award" in 1991.[23]
1979 congressional election[edit]
While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin's 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack.[24] Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979.[25] Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.
Governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)[edit]
Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,141 days.[26]
Elections[edit]

1986

See also: United States gubernatorial elections, 1986; United States gubernatorial elections, 1990; United States gubernatorial elections, 1994; and United States gubernatorial elections, 1998
Thompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field.[27] He defeated Earl 53%–46%.[28]

1990

Thompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.[29]

1994

Thompson won election to a third term defeating Democrat State Senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.[30]

1998

Thompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.[31]
Tenure[edit]




Then-Governor Thompson meets President Bill Clinton, 1993


Thompson is best known nationally for pushing his state to overhaul its welfare system.[18] These reforms were implemented and pioneered before Congress and President Clinton undertook national reform of the program.[18] Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.[18] Thompson was called a "pioneer" for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers.[32][33] In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country's first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don't provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.[citation needed]
Thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.[34]
Thompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[18] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggested that "Many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare." Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[18]
The growth of the state budget during Thompson's 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.[35]
Transportation focus[edit]
While governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001[36][37][38] through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.[39]
Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans.[18] Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be Secretary of Transportation.[18]
Taxes[edit]
In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin.[13] Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987,[40] cutting income tax rates three times[41] and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.[42][43]
When Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he "never raised taxes", he earned a rating of "False" from PolitiFact-Wisconsin.[43] PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson's terms. Politifact said in its rating, "Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way." Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson's claim that Wisconsin's overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.[43]
Two of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor's partial-veto power, were taxes on the state's wealthiest residents.[13] In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy,[13] at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits.[13]
Executive power consolidation[edit]
As governor, Thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees.[13] Among the changes:

Consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the Wisconsin Department of Justice and transferred to Thompson's appointee at the Department of Agriculture
The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor had its budget greatly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.
Education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the move unconstitutional.[13]

Thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional.[13] His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional.[13] Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, "despite a clear ruling" from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.[13]
Tobacco[edit]
As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests.[18] His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris.[18] He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and "delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.[18]
Abortion[edit]
Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.[18]
Treatment of Ojibwa spearfishers[edit]
In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its "Voigt Decision", which found that Wisconsin's Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land.[44] The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.[44][45]
During his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa's rights.[44] Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million.[44] Thompson's administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the "Voigt Decision".[44] The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans' lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.[44]
In 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration's legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger.[45] Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992.[46] On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.[44]
Other leadership roles[edit]
During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States,[13] in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.
Vice presidential discussion[edit]
Thompson's name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.[13]
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position.[13] However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to "bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements", and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson's lack of finesse in their interactions.[13]
After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been "scared to death" of the process and the spotlight of the position.[47]
Health and Human Services Secretary[edit]




Thompson at the 2004 HealthierUS summit


Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001 Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004,[48] and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.
While Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,[48] reorganize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests and thereby provide health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans.[49] In the aftermath of 9–11 he also worked on strengthening the nation's preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.[50]
Key initiatives[edit]
Thompson's major initiatives were "efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes."[51]
Medicare prescription drug-benefit[edit]
Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush's Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush's first term, Thompson frequently served as the president's point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson's tenure as HHS secretary.[52]
As part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken.[53] In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.[54]
2001 anthrax scare[edit]
Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming "utterly overtaken by events" and issuing "early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts."[55]
At a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that "would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication."[56] Thompson offered the media a "far-fetched" suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.[57] Thompson's words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, potentially undermining public confidence, and as the "kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts."[58][59] Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.[56]
Politicizing of science[edit]
In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson's office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit's director.[60] In return, Thompson's office sent back to the unit's director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as "lightweights" with "no scientific credibility." Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having "signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush."[61] This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a "politicization of science" under President George W. Bush's administration.[62][63]
Resignation press conference[edit]
Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists.[51] Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President's reelection at the administration's request.[64][65][66] Some noted, in particular, his words: "I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that."[51]
Post-government career[edit]
After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.[1][67]
Thompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.[68]
In 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson's consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson's work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.[68]
A number of those companies and organizations "he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors." An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that "either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight."[68]
Health care consulting and Law Firm[edit]
Thompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying.[1] There, Thompson provided "strategic advice" to the lobbyists in the firm's health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm's clients.[1]
He also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Care Management and Transformation.[67][69] Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.[67]
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Thompson endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[70]
ADS board membership[edit]
Shortly after leaving his Bush Cabinet post, Thompson joined and served for two years on the board of directors of Applied Digital Solutions, makers of the controversial VeriChip: a glass-encapsulated RFID chip that can be injected into human flesh for various database-driven identification purposes.[71] The FDA issued approval to the device while its parent agency, DHHS, was headed by Thompson, who became a board member of ADS within five months. He received shares of stock in ADS, and compensation, leading the non-profit advocacy group Project on Government Oversight to characterize Thompson's actions "unacceptable" and embarrassing, although unfortunately entirely legal.[71]
Medicare[edit]
After leaving office, Thompson began offering policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary.[72] However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions).[72] These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.[72]
Public interest activities[edit]
Thompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Kennedy School of Government conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy.[73] Thompson also authored a Boston Globe op-ed on the topic.[74]
One of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, Plain Talk about Health.[75]
2008 Presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Tommy Thompson presidential campaign, 2008
After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.[76]
Statement about sexual orientation and workplace protections[edit]
During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker.[77] He said, "I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be." He called CNN the following morning to say he did not hear the question correctly. He apologized, saying, "It's not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace."
Political contributions[edit]
Thompson made campaign contributions to two Democrats in 2008[78] – $250 to Michigan Senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for Governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year's elections. All told, Thompson contributed $11,350 to Republican candidates for federal office in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles, while contributing another $4,900 to Wisconsin Republicans during those same cycles.
Gaffe about Jews, Israel[edit]


“
I'm in the private sector and for the first time in my life I'm earning money. You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that. [...]
I just want to clarify something because I didn't in any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.
”


— Tommy Thompson, address to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism – Consultation on Conscience, Washington, DC, April 16, 2007




“
Thompson was courting public support, not trying to alienate people—which means he somehow believed that repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners! There could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes have become.
”


— Abraham Foxman, National Director, Anti-Defamation League, Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype (Macmillan, 2010, p. 139)


In April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.[79]
On April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector[80][81] and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance.[82] Thompson stated: "You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that."[81] Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments,[83] adding: "I just want to clarify something because I didn't (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that."[81] Thompson's comments caused "unease in the room" as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson's use of this stereotype.[80][82]
Thompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as "Jewish bonds".[80][84][85] He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group[80][84]
Conference organizers noted the unease with Thompson's words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.[86]
The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that "there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become" than Thompson's belief that "repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!"[82]
After the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold.[79] Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.[80][84]
Iowa Straw Poll[edit]
Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race.[citation needed]
Endorses Giuliani[edit]
In October 2007, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that "Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership." He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani's withdrawal from the presidential race.[87] In a New York Times article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain's campaign as saying, "No. I don't know who is."[88]
2012 U.S. Senate election[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2012
On September 19, 2011; Thompson announced he would run for the seat vacated by Sen. Herb Kohl,[89] formally announcing on December 1, 2011. He won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012 after a bitter four-way primary battle against a field which included millionaire hedge fund manager Eric Hovde, former Congressman Mark Neumann and Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.[90]
The attacks on Thompson led to his defense and endorsement by former Arkansas governor, presidential candidate, and conservative media figure Mike Huckabee.[91]
ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson's bid for US Senate in the autumn of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, taking 45.9 percent to Baldwin's 51.5 percent. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state's two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.[citation needed]
Political positions[edit]
During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, "who better than me, that’s already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?"[92] When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare, but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.[92]
Thompson favors making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15 percent flat tax.[93]

Tommy G. Thompson advises clients in a strategic advisory capacity* on issues relating to health care and, more generally, on issues facing the business community.
Practice & Background
Tommy G. Thompson is a former U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary and four-term governor of Wisconsin. Gov. Thompson began his extensive career in public service in 1966 as a representative in Wisconsin’s state assembly, later being elected assistant assembly minority leader in 1973 and assembly minority leader in 1981. Gov. Thompson was previously a partner with Akin Gump from 2005 to early 2012.
While serving as HHS Secretary, Gov. Thompson served as the nation’s leading advocate for the health and welfare of all Americans. As Secretary, among other achievements, Gov. Thompson led the Bush administration’s efforts to pass the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003. A leading advocate of welfare reform, he also focused on expanding services to seniors, the disabled and low-income Americans.
As governor of Wisconsin, Gov. Thompson was best known for his efforts to revitalize the Wisconsin economy, his national leadership on welfare reform and his work in expanding health care access across all segments of society.
Since his term in public office, Gov. Thompson has dedicated himself to building on his efforts as HHS Secretary and governor to develop innovative solutions to the health care challenges facing both businesses and organizations of various stripes, as well as governmental agencies at the local, state and federal level. These efforts have focused on improving the use of information technology in hospitals, clinics and doctors’ offices; promoting healthier lifestyles; strengthening and modernizing Medicare and Medicaid; and expanding the use of medical diplomacy around the world.

Tommy G. Thompson is a BPC senior fellow and co-chairs its Long-Term Care Initiative. He is the chairman and chief executive officer of Thompson Holdings, and former secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and four-term governor of Wisconsin.
As governor from 1987-2001, Thompson built a national reputation for his groundbreaking work in rebuilding Wisconsin’s economy, enacting the first welfare-to-work law, offering school choice to students in Milwaukee, and providing health care to working families who could not afford health insurance.
As HHS secretary from 2001-05, Thompson led the administration’s successful passage and implementation of the Medicare prescription drug benefit for America’s seniors. He led the effort to reinvigorate the nation’s public health infrastructure by providing states and communities the resources they need to respond to terrorist attacks or other public health emergencies. Additionally, he launched a national campaign to encourage families, businesses, and communities to lead healthier lifestyles. And as chairman of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Thompson led the United States’ efforts to stem the spread of HIV/AIDS around the world.
After leaving public office, Thompson joined the private sector and expanded his efforts to develop innovative solutions to the health care challenges facing American families, businesses, communities, states, and the nation as a whole. These efforts focus on improving the use of information technology in hospitals, clinics, and doctors’ offices; promoting healthier lifestyles; strengthening and modernizing Medicare and Medicaid; and expanding the use of medical diplomacy around the world.
He currently serves on the board of directors of Centene Corporation; C.R. Bard, Inc.; United Therapeutics Corporation; Cytori Therapeutics, Inc.; and TherapeuticsMD, Inc.

  Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge HENDERSON.
   KAREN LECRAFT HENDERSON, Circuit Judge: Appellants
Mylan Laboratories, Inc. Mylan Technologies, Inc. and Mylan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Mylan) appeal the district court’s sum-
mary judgment upholding the decision of appellee Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA decision granted
appellees ALZA Corp. and Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc, both
subsidiaries of Johnson and Johnson, (collectively, ALZA) a
six-month period of pediatric marketing exclusivity, pursuant
to 21 U.S.C. § 355a, following expiration of the final patent
for ALZA’s brand name transdermal fentanyl system, the
Duragesic patch, which releases fentanyl, a narcotic analgesic,
through the skin to treat chronic pain. Mylan contends the
FDA’s final approval of Mylan’s Abbreviated New Drug
Applications (ANDA) to market a generic version of the
Duragesic patch, granted before the FDA issued the decision
                               3

challenged here, entitled Mylan to market its generic product
immediately upon expiration of the patent pursuant to 21
U.S.C. § 355(j), without regard to pediatric exclusivity. For
the reasons set out below, we affirm the district court’s
judgment upholding the FDA’s decision.


                               I.
   This appeal requires that the court consider three separate
statutory provisions: (1) 21 U.S.C. § 355(j), a provision of the
1984 Hatch–Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which authorizes a drug
manufacturer to submit an ANDA to the FDA to obtain
approval of a generic version of a previously approved drug;
(2) 21 U.S.C. § 355a, a 1997 amendment to the FDCA, which
authorizes an extra six-month ‘‘pediatric exclusivity’’ period
following expiration of a drug patent for a patent holder that
has satisfactorily conducted pediatric testing of its drug upon
the FDA’s request; and (3) 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4), a patent
statute, also enacted in the Hatch–Waxman Amendments,
which sets out the exclusive remedies available in a patent
infringement action. We begin with a summary of these
three provisions.

            A.   Applicable Statutory Provisions
  The ANDA provision, 21 U.S.C. § 355(j), creates an ap-
proval short-cut for applicants seeking to market generic
versions of approved drugs. Under this provision the generic
applicant need not conduct its own clinical trials if the ANDA
certifies that the generic version is bioequivalent to an ap-
proved drug. In addition, the ANDA must include one of
four statutory ‘‘certifications’’ regarding the approved drug’s
patent status:
    (I) that such patent information has not been filed,
    (II) that such patent has expired,
    (III) TTT the date on which such patent will expire, or
                                  4

      (IV) that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by
           the manufacture, use, or sale of the new drug for
           which the application is submitted; TTTT
21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(I)-(IV) (paragraphs I-IV). If the
ANDA contains a paragraph IV certification, the applicant
must, within 20 days of the ANDA filing, send a notice to the
patent holder stating it has submitted an ANDA with the
paragraph IV certification and setting out the factual and
legal bases for believing the patent is invalid or will not be
infringed. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(B).
   The ANDA provision also establishes the effective date for
approval of the ANDA, depending on the particular certifica-
tion made.
   If the applicant makes a certification under paragraph I or
II, ‘‘the approval may be made effective immediately.’’ 21
U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(i).
   If the certification is under paragraph III, ‘‘the approval
may be made effective on the date certified under [paragraph
III].’’ 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(ii).
   If the certification is under paragraph IV, ‘‘the approval
shall be made effective immediately’’ unless the patent holder
files an infringement action in the district court within 45
days of receiving the notice, in which event ‘‘the approval
shall be made effective upon the expiration of the thirty-
month period beginning on the date of the receipt of the
notice,’’ unless the district court rules on the infringement
claim within the 30-month period.                See 21 U.S.C.
§ 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). If the district court issues a ruling during
the 30-month stay period, the ANDA approval date is deter-
mined by the decision of the district court, or the appellate
court if appealed.1
  1 If the district court decides within the stay period that the
patent is invalid or not infringed, ‘‘the approval shall be made
effective on’’ the date of entry of judgment or of a settlement order
or consent decree. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)(I). If the district
court decides the patent is infringed and the judgment is not
appealed or is affirmed, ‘‘the approval shall be made effective on the
date specified by the district court in a court order under section
                                    5

   The pediatric exclusivity provision, 21 U.S.C. § 355a, pro-
vides an incentive for a drug patent holder to conduct pedia-
tric studies of a drug which the FDA believes may have
beneficial pediatric use. Under the statute, the FDA must
first request that the drug patent holder conduct pediatric
studies; if the requested studies are satisfactorily completed
and submitted within the FDA-prescribed time frame, the
patent holder is eligible to receive a six-month period of
market exclusivity for the drug beyond the patent expiration
date. 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c). The pediatric exclusivity provi-
sion expressly addresses the effect of a grant of pediatric
exclusivity, depending on the particular certification included
in the ANDA:
     (2)(A) if the drug is the subject of–
           (i) a listed patent for which a certification has been
        submitted under [paragraph II] and for which pedia-
        tric studies were submitted prior to the expiration of
        the patent (including any patent extensions); or
          (ii) a listed patent for which a certification has been
        submitted under [paragraph III],
     the period during which an application may not be ap-
     proved under TTT section 355(j)(5)(B) of this title shall be
     extended by a period of six months after the date the
     patent expires (including any patent extensions); or
       (B) if the drug is the subject of a listed patent for
     which a certification has been submitted under [para-
     graph IV], and in the patent infringement litigation
     resulting from the certification the court determines that
     the patent is valid and would be infringed, the period
     during which an application may not be approved under

271(e)(4)(A).’’ Id. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)(II)(bb). In turn, if the infringe-
ment judgment is appealed, ‘‘the approval shall be made effective
on’’ either ‘‘the date on which the court of appeals decides that the
patent is invalid or not infringed’’ or ‘‘the date of a settlement order
or consent decree signed and entered by the court of appeals
stating that the patent that is the subject of the certification is
invalid or not infringed.’’ Id. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii)(II)(aa).
                                  6

      TTT section 355(j)(5)(B) of this title shall be extended by a
      period of six months after the date the patent expires
      (including any patent extensions).

21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A)-(B).2
   Finally, 35 U.S.C. § 271, a patent statute provision, author-
izes the following remedies in a patent infringement action:

      (4) For an act of infringement described in paragraph
      (2)—
          (A) the court shall order the effective date of any
        approval of the drug or veterinary biological product
        involved in the infringement to be a date which is not
        earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent
        which has been infringed,
           (B) injunctive relief may be granted against an in-
        fringer to prevent the commercial manufacture, use,
        offer to sell, or sale within the United States or
        importation into the United States of an approved drug
        or veterinary biological product, and
          (C) damages or other monetary relief may be
        awarded against an infringer only if there has been
        commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or sale
        within the United States or importation into the Unit-
        ed States of an approved drug or veterinary biological
        product.
      The remedies prescribed by subparagraphs (A), (B), and
      (C) are the only remedies which may be granted by a
      court for an act of infringement described in paragraph
  2 If the district court in the patent infringement litigation deter-
mines the patent is invalid or will not be infringed, ANDA approval
is effective upon the date of the court order so stating under 21
U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) and the patent holder is entitled to no
exclusivity thereafter. See, e.g., Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 140
F.3d 1060, 1066 (D.C. Cir. 1998).
                               7

    (2), except that a court may award attorney fees under
    section 285.
35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4).

                    B.   This Proceeding
  Appellee ALZA owned U.S. Patent No. 4,588,580 (’580
patent) for Duragesic. By its terms the ’580 patent expired
on July 23, 2004.
   In July 1999 the FDA wrote ALZA requesting that it
perform pediatric studies of Duragesic pursuant to 21 U.S.C.
§ 355a(c). ALZA submitted the requested studies in Novem-
ber 2002. On January 29, 2003 the FDA granted ALZA a
six-month pediatric exclusivity period.
   Meanwhile, in October 2001 Mylan filed with the FDA an
ANDA to market its generic fentanyl transdermal system
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 355(j) with a paragraph IV certifica-
tion that ALZA’s ’580 patent was invalid or would not be
infringed by Mylan’s martketing of its generic product. As
required under 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(B), on December 6, 2001
Mylan sent ALZA notice of its ANDA application and certifi-
cation which ALZA received on December 10, 2001. On
January 25, 2002, the forty-sixth day after notice was re-
ceived, ALZA filed a patent infringement action against My-
lan in the United States District Court for the District of
Vermont. Because the action was not brought within the
statutory 45-day window following notice receipt, there was
no automatic 30-month stay and, under 21 U.S.C.
§ 355(j)(5)(B)(iii), Mylan’s ANDA was to ‘‘be made effective
immediately.’’ Accordingly, on November 21, 2003, the FDA
granted final approval of Mylan’s ANDA.
   On March 24, 2004 the Vermont District Court issued a
decision holding that ‘‘[t]he ’580 patent is not invalid’’ and
‘‘Mylan’s ANDA filing for a generic version of Duragesic b
infringe[s] TTT the ’580 patent.’’ ALZA v. Mylan, 310 F.
Supp. 2d 610, 637 (D. Vt. 2004). The court therefore enjoined
Mylan from ‘‘making, using, offering to sell, selling within the
United States or importing into the United States’’ its generic
                                  8

fentanyl transdermal system. 310 F. Supp. 2d at 637. Re-
garding Mylan’s ANDA approval, the court stated simply that
‘‘the effective date of any approval of Mylan’s ANDA product
shall be no earlier than the date of expiration of the ’580
patent family.’’ Id. Mylan appealed the decision to the
Federal Circuit where it remains pending.
   In the meantime, both Mylan and ALZA sought a determi-
nation from the FDA on whether Mylan could lawfully mar-
ket its generic fentanyl transdermal system when the ’580
patent expired or whether Mylan was required to wait until
the six-month pediatric exclusivity period expired. In two
letters dated June 22, 2004, the FDA issued its administrative
decision.
   In the first letter (Letter 1), addressed to counsel for both
parties, the FDA concluded that ‘‘ALZA’s pediatric exclusivi-
ty for fentanyl will attach, and thus delay effective approval of
Mylan’s ANDA,’’ so that ‘‘[u]nless Mylan were to win its
patent case on appeal, Mylan’s ANDA would be eligible for
final effective approval no earlier than six months after
the ’580 patent expires on July 23, 2004.’’ Letter 1 at 11.
The FDA rested its decision on two key determinations.
   First, the FDA concluded that the Vermont district court’s
order that ‘‘the effective date of any approval of Mylan’s
ANDA product shall be no earlier than the date of expiration
of the ’580 patent family,’’ 310 F. Supp. 2d at 637, trans-
formed Mylan’s ANDA approval into ‘‘an approval with a
delayed effective date,’’ which ‘‘is a tentative approval that
cannot be made effective until FDA issues a letter granting
final effective approval.’’ Letter 1 at 11 (citing 21 C.F.R.
§ 314.107(b)(3)(v);3 Barr Labs. v. Thompson, 238 F. Supp. 2d
236, 245-50 (D.D.C. 2002)).
  3   This regulation provides:
      In order for an approval to be made effective under paragraph
      (b)(3) of this section, the applicant must receive an approval
      letter from the agency indicating that the application has
      received final approval. Tentative approval of an application
                                  9

   Second, the FDA concluded that, when ALZA’s patent
expired, Mylan’s paragraph IV certification would no longer
be accurate and Mylan would be required to amend it or, ‘‘[i]f
Mylan refuses to amend its application to change its certifica-
tion after the patent expires, FDA can treat that certification
as automatically amended to contain a paragraph II certifica-
tion (because there is no other proper certification upon
expiry).’’ Letter 1 at 12 (citing Ranbaxy Labs. v. FDA, 307
F. Supp. 2d 15, 19, 21 (D.D.C. 2004), aff’d, 96 Fed. App. 1
(D.C. Cir 2004)). Then, once Mylan’s certification converted
to paragraph II, ‘‘pediatric exclusivity attaches under
355a(c)(2)(A)(i),’’ Letter 1 at 12 (citing Ranbaxy, 307 F. Supp.
2d at 20, 21), so that ‘‘ ‘the period during which an [ANDA]
may not be approved TTT shall be extended by a period of six
months after the date the patent expires,’ ’’id. (quoting 21
U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A)(i)).
   In the second letter (Letter 2), addressed to Mylan only,
the FDA informed Mylan that, ‘‘in light of [the Vermont
district court’s] decision, the Agency hereby rescinds the final
approval of ANDA 76–258 issued on November 21, 2003, and
regards ANDA 76–258 as tentatively approved.’’ Letter 2 at
1. The letter again noted that, after the Vermont district
court’s order, Mylan’s ANDA approval had ‘‘a delayed effec-
tive date,’’ which, by FDA regulation, constitutes ‘‘tentative,’’
rather than ‘‘final,’’ approval.       Id. (citing 21 C.F.R.
               4
§ 314.105(a)). Accordingly, the FDA informed Mylan: ‘‘Fi-
nal Approval cannot be granted earlier than the date of a
court decision finding the patents invalid, not infringed or
unenforceable, or the expiration date of the patent and any
period of pediatric exclusivity granted to the NDA holder.’’

      does not constitute ‘‘approval’’ of an application and cannot,
      absent a final approval letter from the agency, result in an
      effective approval under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
  4This regulation provides: ‘‘An approval becomes effective on the
date of the issuance of the approval letter, except with regard to an
approval under section 505(b)(2) of the act with a delayed effective
date. An approval with a delayed effective date is tentative and
does not become final until the effective date.’’
                               10

Id. at 1-2 & n.2 (noting that Mylan’s ANDA was ‘‘subject to
ALZA’s pediatric exclusivity for fentanyl transdermal sys-
tem’’).
   On June 24, 2000 Mylan filed this action in the district
court seeking a determination that the FDA’s ‘‘revocation’’ of
Mylan’s final ANDA approval was unlawful and an injunction
prohibiting the FDA ‘‘from revoking the final approval of
Mylan’s ANDA and from applying [ALZA’s] pediatric exclu-
sivity to Mylan’s ANDA.’’ Mylan v. Thompson, 332 F. Supp.
2d 106, 114 (D.C.C. 2004). In a decision filed August 17, 2004
the district court granted summary judgment in the FDA’s
favor, concluding that the agency ‘‘did not improperly revoke
or reclassify its final approval of Mylan’s ANDA for a generic
version of a fentanyl transdermal system to a tentative ap-
proval and did not improperly apply ALZA pediatric exclusiv-
ity to Mylan’s ANDA.’’ 332 F. Supp. 2d at 124. Mylan
appealed the district court’s summary judgment.

                                II.
   ‘‘The court reviews the district court’s summary judgment
decision de novo and ‘we may affirm only if ‘‘there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact [and] the moving party
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’’ ’ ’’ Trans Union
LLC v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 295 F.3d 42, 48 (D.C. Cir. 2002)
(quoting Gilvin v. Fire, 259 F.3d 749, 756 (D.C. Cir 2001)
(quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250
(1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(C)))). We review the
FDA’s decision under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5
U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Serono Labs. v. Shalala, 158 F.3d 1313,
1327 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (citing Troy Corp. v. Browner, 120 F.3d
277, 283 (D.C. Cir. 1997); Schering Corp v. FDA, 51 F.3d 390,
399 (3d Cir. 1995)). Accordingly, we must uphold the FDA’s
decision unless it is ‘‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discre-
tion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.’’ 5 U.S.C.
§ 706(2). We conclude that the FDA’s decision was none of
these.
  At issue is the FDA’s application of the statutory provisions
summarized above. ‘‘Ordinarily we review an agency’s inter-
                                11

pretation of a statute it is charged with implementing under
the familiar and deferential two-part framework of Chevron
U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984).’’ Pharm.
Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Thompson, 362 F.3d 817, 821
(D.C. Cir. 2004). Mylan contends, however, that only minimal
deference is owed to the FDA’s interpretation of the FDCA
because it was expressed in letters to the parties and ‘‘is not
embodied in any regulation, much less a regulation that was
subject to notice and comment rulemaking.’’ Appellants’ Br.
at 19-20. The FDA’s letter decisions, Mylan maintains, are
‘‘analogous to ‘opinion letters,’ ’’ id. at 20 (quoting Skidmore
v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)), and therefore ‘‘do
not warrant Chevron-style deference’’ but are entitled only
‘‘ ‘ ‘‘to respect’’ ’ ’’ and even then ‘‘ ‘only to the extent that
those interpretations have the power ‘‘to persuade,’’ ’ ’’ Chris-
tensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) (quoting
Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 140; other citations omitted)). We are
not persuaded by Mylan’s argument and conclude, as did the
district court, that the FDA’s decision is entitled to Chevron
deference.5
  ‘‘ ‘[T]he want of’ notice and comment ‘does not decide the
case’ ’’ against Chevron deference. Barnhart v. Walton, 535
U.S. 212, 222 (2002) (quoting United States v. Mead Corp.,
533 U.S. 218, 230-31 (2001)). ‘‘Indeed, Mead pointed to
instances in which the Court has applied Chevron deference
to agency interpretations that did not emerge out of notice-
and-comment rulemaking,’’ Id. (citing United States v. Mead
Corp., 533 U.S. at 230-31 (citing NationsBank of N. C., N.A.
v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 256-57
  5    Mylan also asserts, correctly, that the court owes no defer-
ence to the FDA’s interpretation of 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4)(A), a
patent statute provision which the FDA is not charged with admin-
istering, see Scheduled Airlines Traffic Offices, Inc. v. Dep’t of
Defense, 87 F.3d 1356, 1361 (D.C. Cir. 1996); or of the decision of
the Vermont district court, see American Bioscience v. Thompson,
269 F.3d 1077, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Neither the statute nor the
court decision, however, presented any ambiguity for the FDA to
interpret.
                               12

(1995))). ‘‘[W]hether a court should give such deference
depends in significant part upon the interpretive method used
and the nature of the question at issue.’’ Id. (citing Mead,
533 U.S. at 229-31). In Barnhardt the Court concluded that
‘‘the interstitial nature of the legal question, the related
expertise of the Agency, the importance of the question to
administration of the statute, the complexity of that adminis-
tration, and the careful consideration the Agency has given
the question over a long period of time all indicate that
Chevron provides the appropriate legal lens through which to
view the legality of the Agency interpretation here at issue.’’
Id. We reach the same conclusion here.
  There is no denying the complexity of the statutory regime
under which the FDA operates, the FDA’s expertise or the
careful craft of the scheme it devised to reconcile the various
statutory provisions. Further, the FDA’s decision made no
great legal leap but relied in large part on its previous
determination of the same or similar issues and on its own
regulations. See Letter 1 at 11-12 (citing 21 C.F.R.
§ 314.107(b)(3)(v), Barr and Ranbaxy); Letter 2 at 1 (citing
21 C.F.R. § 314.105(a)). We therefore accord Chevron defer-
ence to the FDA’s letter decision here, as we have previously
done on at least one other occasion. See Abbott Labs. v.
Young, 920 F.2d 984, 986-89 (D.C. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 502
U.S. 819 (1991) (reviewing under Chevron letter decision
construing term ‘‘active ingredient’’ in ANDA provision, 21
U.S.C. § 355(j)(4)(D)(i), (v)); id. at 992–96 (Edwards, J.,
dissenting) (applying Chevron); see also Barr Labs. v.
Thompson, 238 F. Supp. 2d 236, 245-50 (D.D.C. 2002) (apply-
ing Chevron to FDA letter ruling).6
   ‘‘Under the Chevron framework, ‘[i]f TTT ‘‘Congress has
directly spoken to the precise question at issue,’’ we must give
effect to Congress’s ‘‘unambiguously expressed intent’’ ’ but
  6 Even were the FDA’s decision subject only to Skidmore defer-
ence, the result would likely be the same. See Ranbaxy Labs. v.
FDA, 96 Fed. App. 1, 1 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (‘‘Regardless whether the
[FDA’s] decision is reviewed under [Skidmore or Chevron], the
district court properly affirmed the FDA’s determinationTTTT’’).
                               13

‘[i]f ‘‘the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the
specific issue,’’ we ask whether the agency’s position rests on
a ‘‘permissible construction of the statute.’’ ’ ’’ Pharm. Re-
search & Mfrs., 362 F.3d at 823–24 (quoting Beverly Health &
Rehab. Servs. v. NLRB, 317 F.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2003)
(quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842–43). In applying the
FDCA provisions to the particular facts here, the FDA found
two ambiguities.
   First, application of the various statutory provisions results
in conflicting effective dates for Mylan’s ANDA. The patent
infringement remedy statute, 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4)(A), directs
that the court deciding the infringement action ‘‘shall order
the effective date of any approval of the drug or veterinary
biological product involved in the infringement to be a date
which is not earlier than the date of the expiration of the
patent which has been infringed,’’ which is precisely what the
Vermont district court did here, directing that ‘‘the effective
date of any approval of Mylan’s ANDA product shall be no
earlier than the date of expiration of the ’580 patent family,’’
310 F. Supp. 2d at 637; yet under 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii),
approval of the paragraph IV ANDA was to ‘‘be made
effective immediately’’ after the 45-day window closed without
an infringement action filed by the patent holder, so that the
FDA was required to (and did) grant final approval of My-
lan’s ANDA, immediately effective, notwithstanding the pend-
ing infringement action. As a result, at the time of the FDA
letter decision, Mylan’s ANDA was subject to two conflicting
approval effective dates: the date of the FDA’s approval
decision (November 21, 2003) and, pursuant to the Vermont
district court’s order, a date ‘‘no earlier than the date of
expiration of the ’580 patent family’’ (i.e., July 23, 2004).
   Second, after the Vermont district court’s finding of patent
validity, Mylan’s paragraph IV ANDA certification was at
variance with the legal reality. Because the ’580 patent was
then valid and infringed as a matter of law, ANDA’s certifica-
tion that the ’580 patent ‘‘is invalid or will not be infringed by
the manufacture, use, or sale of the new drug for which the
application is submitted’’ was no longer accurate. Further,
                                14

section 355a(c)(2), which governs the consequences for pedia-
tric exclusivity under each of the alternative patent certifica-
tions, provided no mechanism to resolve this discrepancy
because, at least as construed in the administrative proceed-
ing, this section applies to a paragraph IV certification only if
an infringement action has been filed within the 45-day
window so as to trigger the 30–month stay period.7 Because
the infringement action here was filed outside the 45-day
window, the FDA was left with a statutory gap to fill.
  In deciding the exclusivity issue submitted by Mylan and
ALZA, the FDA was called upon to construe the statutes so
as to resolve these two conflicts. We conclude the FDA did
so in a way that reflects a permissible construction of the
applicable FDCA provisions and therefore satisfies Chevron.
See Western Coal Traffic League v. Surface Transp. Bd., 216
F.3d 1168, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (reviewing under Chevron
agency resolution of ‘‘unanticipated conflict’’ arising from
application of statute).

A.    Conversion of Approval from ‘‘Final’’ to ‘‘Tentative’’
    First, the FDA concluded that, as a consequence of the
Vermont district court’s determination under 35 U.S.C.
§ 271(e)(4)(A) that ‘‘the effective date of any approval of
Mylan’s ANDA product shall be no earlier than the date of
expiration of the ’580 patent family,’’ the FDA’s approval of
Mylan’s ANDA was no longer ‘‘immediately effective’’—its
effective date had changed, as the Congress had contemplat-
ed it would under such circumstances when it enacted 35
U.S.C. § 271. See H.R. Rep. No. 98-857, pt. 1, at 46 (1984)
(‘‘In the case where an ANDA had been approved, the order
would mandate a change in the effective date.’’). The FDA
  7 On appeal the appellees argue alternatively that section
355a(c)(2)(B) can be read to cover the situation when the action is
filed after the 45-day window as well as before (obviating the need
for certification conversion). This may well be a permissible con-
struction of the provision but it is not the reading the FDA applied
during the administrative proceeding nor the one before us on
review of the FDA’s decision.

next determined, logically enough, that the effective date was
then ‘‘delayed’’ and therefore ‘‘tentative,’’ rather than ‘‘imme-
diate’’ and ‘‘final,’’ under the FDA’s own regulation which
provides that ‘‘[a]n approval with a delayed effective date is
tentative and does not become final until the effective date.’’
21 C.F.R. § 314.105(a); see Barr Labs. v. Thompson, 238 F.
Supp. 2d 236, 245-50 (D.D.C. 2002) (upholding FDA determi-
nation under 21 C.F.R. § 314.105(a) that ANDA approval
before patent expiration was tentative, not final).
   Mylan contends the FDA lacked authority to revoke My-
lan’s final ANDA approval granted on November 21, 2003
because its authority to revoke a final approval is limited to
those specific circumstances set out in 21 U.S.C. § 355(e),
none of which exists here. Mylan’s characterization of sec-
tion 355(e) is off the mark. As the FDA indicates in its
decision, Letter 1 at 12 n.10, section 355(e) simply sets out
specific, not necessarily exclusive, circumstances under which
the FDA must withdraw any ANDA approval (whether final
or otherwise) after notice and hearing. But the provision
does not prohibit the FDA from withdrawing approval under
other circumstances—or, more precisely, does not prohibit
the FDA from changing a final into a tentative approval
under circumstances different from those named in section
355(e).8 Moreover, the patent remedy statute directs that
upon a finding of infringement the district court establish a
new effective date for approval which is ‘‘not earlier than the
date of the expiration of the patent which has been infringed.’’
35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(4)(A), and the FDA was bound under the
district court’s order to treat the status of Mylan’s ANDA
under the FDCA ‘‘the same as that of other ANDAs blocked
from final approval by patent or exclusivity rights.’’ Letter 1
at 12 n.10.
  8 We are skeptical whether the parties properly characterize the
FDA’s action as ‘‘withdrawal’’ or ‘‘revocation’’ of approval. It seems
to us that Mylan’s ANDA approval was never in fact ‘‘withdrawn’’
or ‘‘revoked’’ but remained continuously in effect based on the
FDA’s review of the ANDA described in the November 21, 2003
final approval letter. The approval merely underwent a change of
                                16

   Mylan also claims the approval conversion is ‘‘contrary to
past Agency practice.’’ Appellants’ Br. 43 (citing Mead John-
son Pharm. Group v. Bowen, 838 F.2d 1332, 1334 (D.C. Cir.
1988), and Unimed, Inc. v. Quigg, 888 F.2d 826, 827 (Fed.
Cir. 1989)). Each cited case, however, involved not an ANDA
but a New Drug Application, a different animal entirely
because the latter is generally not subject to a delayed
effective date, and each application was subject to an approval
letter authorizing immediate marketing without any delayed
effective date. See Mead Johnson, 838 F.2d at 1336 (noting
applicant could have marketed its product on day of approval
by filing required supplemental labeling); Unimed, 888 F.2d
at 828 (FDA letter noting product could not be marketed
until it was ‘‘rescheduled’’ by DEA simply ‘‘reminded Unimed
that DEA rescheduling was necessary before the drug could
be marketed’’ and ‘‘was not a condition on FDA approval’’)
(emphasis original).9

             B.   Conversion of Paragraph IV to
                  Paragraph II Certification
  The FDA next addressed the problem of Mylan’s inaccu-
rate ANDA certification and resolved it relying on Ranbaxy
Labs. v. FDA, 307 F. Supp. 2d 15 (D.D.C. 2004), aff’d, 96 Fed.
App. 1 (D.C. Cir 2004). The FDA concluded that under
Ranbaxy when the ’580 patent expired, Mylan’s paragraph IV
certification would convert to a paragraph II certification and
ALZA would be entitled to pediatric exclusivity for six
months following the expiration. The FDA reasoned that

status or classification from final to tentative after the Vermont
district court delayed its effective date.
  9 Nor do we see any force in Mylan’s citation to the FDA’s 1994
rulemaking, in which the FDA declined to extend by rule the
statutory 45-day window. Appellants’ Br. at 42 (quoting 59 Fed.
Reg. at 50,353). The FDA simply explained there that if the
window were to be extended (which it was not), the FDA would
retain authority during the extension to grant final effective ANDA
approval, notwithstanding the patent holder might subsequently file
a successful infringement action.
                               17

once the certification became inaccurate, Mylan was under a
duty to amend its ANDA to change the certification to
paragraph II, see 21 C.F.R. § 314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)(i) (provid-
ing ‘‘an applicant shall amend a submitted certification if, at
any time before the effective date of the approval of the
application, the applicant learns that the submitted certifica-
tion is no longer accurate’’); and if Mylan failed to do so, the
FDA could ‘‘treat that certification as automatically amended
to contain a paragraph II certification.’’ Letter 1 at 12.
Once the certification changed to paragraph II—whether de
facto or de jure—pediatric exclusivity attached under 21
U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A)(i) (‘‘[I]f the drug is the subject of– TTT
a listed patent for which a certification has been submitted
under [paragraph II] and for which pediatric studies were
submitted prior to the expiration of the patent; TTT the
period during which an application may not be approved
under TTT section 355(j)(5)(B) of this title shall be extended
by a period of six months after the date the patent expires.’’).
We find the FDA’s application of the statutory provisions
both reasonable and supported by Ranbaxy.
   In Ranbaxy the FDA also converted an ANDA classifica-
tion from a paragraph IV to a paragraph II certification
under similar circumstances. The patent holder in Ranbaxy
filed an infringement action within forty-five days after re-
ceiving the required paragraph IV certification notice. Upon
learning the district court would be unable to decide the case
before the patent expiration date, the parties signed a stipula-
tion to dismiss the action as of the expiration date. The day
before expiration, the FDA informed the ANDA applicant
that its ANDA would be subject to a six-month pediatric
exclusivity period for the patented drug. There, as here, 21
U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(B) did not apply (there, because there was
no finding of a valid patent or infringement) and the FDA
concluded that upon the patent expiry the paragraph IV
certification converted to a paragraph II certification and
pediatric     exclusivity   attached    under      21    U.S.C.
§ 355a(c)(2)(A)(i). The district court agreed with the FDA’s
statutory construction and on appeal we concluded:
                                18

    [T]he district court properly affirmed the FDA’s determi-
    nation that, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
    Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301, et seq., final approval of Ranbaxy’s
    Abbreviated New Drug Applications (‘‘ANDAs’’) did not
    automatically occur upon the dismissal of the underlying
    patent litigation, the expiration of the patent, and the
    termination of the thirty-month statutory stay. The
    district court also properly affirmed the FDA’s conclu-
    sion that, upon the expiration of Pfizer’s patent on Janu-
    ary 29, 2004, Ranbaxy’s ‘‘Paragraph IV’’ certifications
    became invalid, and the applicable pediatric exclusivity
    provision became 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A), the provision
    pertaining to ‘‘Paragraph II’’ certifications. Id. Under
    that provision, approval of Ranbaxy’s ANDAs is delayed
    six monthsTTTT See 21 U.S.C. § 355a(c)(2)(A).
96 Fed. App. at 1. For the same reasons, the district court
here acted properly in upholding the FDA’s certification
conversion.
    Mylan contends that one of the FDA’s own regulations
weighs against this rationale, namely, 21 C.F.R.
§ 314.94(a)(12)(viii)(A), which requires that an ANDA appli-
cant amend its application to recertify under paragraph III
(‘‘that the patent will expire on a particular date’’) if a finding
of validity/infringement is made in a lawsuit that has been
filed within the statutory 45-day window. Mylan asserts the
‘‘necessary implication’’ of this language is that ‘‘if the appli-
cant is not sued within the forty-five-day-period, 21 U.S.C.
§ 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) requires that approval of an ANDA shall be
‘effective immediately’ and certifications are no longer rele-
vant.’’ Appellants’ Br. at 42. Mylan reads too much into the
regulation. That the FDA has expressly required recertifica-
tion when an action is filed within the 45-day window does not
‘‘necessarily’’ mean an applicant need not amend its applica-
tion to change the patent certification to reflect changed
circumstances if the action is not filed within the window. To
the extent that the cited regulation is relevant here, it sup-
ports the FDA’s rationale in requiring a generic drug appli-
                                  19

cant to amend its ANDA to include an accurate certification.10
   Mylan also contends the FDA’s construction ‘‘would read
[section 355a(c)(2)(B)] entirely out of the statute’’ because, if
it ‘‘does not govern the availability of pediatric exclusivity in
cases like this one involving Paragraph IV certifications in
which infringement is found, the statute serves no purpose at
all.’’ Appellants’ Br. at 22-23. Not so. Under the FDA’s
interpretation, section 355a(c)(2)(B) applies when—and only
when—all three of its express conditions are met: ‘‘a certifi-
cation has been submitted under [paragraph IV],’’ there is
‘‘patent infringement litigation resulting from the certifica-
tion’’ and in the litigation ‘‘the court determines that the
patent is valid and would be infringed.’’ It is only because
one of these requirements was missing in Ranbaxy (a valid
patent finding) and in this case (an infringement action filed
within the 45-day window) that the FDA, prevented from
applying its reading of section 355a(c)(2)(B), was required to
fill the statutory gap by deeming the patent certification
changed.

                             * * *
   We affirm the district court’s judgment because the FDA’s
decision reasonably resolves the ambiguity in applying the
relevant statutes to a factual situation not fully foreseen or
provided for by the Congress when it enacted the statutes or
the FDA when it promulgated regulations. The Vermont
district court’s finding of patent validity and consequent
injunction changed the factual and legal landscape and the
agency’s response to the court’s decision is both reasonable
and consistent with the statutory language. The FDA’s
  10 The FDA might well have concluded that in this situation too,
as ALZA suggested in the administrative proceeding, see Letter 1
at 11, the paragraph IV certification should have changed to a
paragraph III certification immediately upon the district court’s
finding of validity/infringement, consistent with the directive of 21
C.F.R. § 314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)(1)(i) that ‘‘an applicant shall amend a
submitted certification if, at any time before the effective date of
the approval of the application, the applicant learns that the submit-
ted certification is no longer accurate.’’
                                 20

solution effects the policies of both the generic ANDA provi-
sion, by eliminating the need for Mylan to conduct clinical
trials of its generic product, and the pediatric exclusivity
provision, by granting ALZA a six-month exclusivity period in
return for the pediatric studies it performed, the adequacy of
which Mylan does not dispute. At the same time, it main-
tains the incentive under 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) for a
patent holder to promptly file an infringement action when its
patent is challenged because, if the patent holder fails to do
so within forty-five days, it will lose the benefit of the 30-
month stay period and possibly, for a time, market exclusivity
it should rightfully enjoy.11
                                                        So ordered.
  11 In a case such as this, for example, if the district court found

the patent invalid, without the 30–month stay the ANDA applicant
would obtain immediate approval under the court’s decision to
market its generic product notwithstanding the patent holder might
subsequently successfully appeal the district court’s decision.

Thompson. On the lam for more than two years, Thompson did virtually everything he could to become “invisible,” leading law enforcement officers on a storybook chase for a man with few financial limitations, an abundance of smarts and a dogged determination to leave no paper trails. “Thompson was smart — perhaps one of the smartest fugitives ever sought by the U.S. Marshals,” Peter Tobin, U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Ohio, said in a statement announcing his capture. Thompson, Tobin said, had “almost limitless resources and approximately a ten year head start.” And yet, Tobin noted, law enforcement agencies, using “all of our resources and ingenuity,” still accomplished “what some thought would be near impossible.”    A photo of Thompson released this week. (U.S. Marshals Service via European Pressphoto Agency)  Thompson had been wanted since failing to appear before a judge in 2012, in legal proceedings that stemmed from his headline-making discovery of a sunken ship laden with gold. Thompson had found the treasure in 1988, but investors who helped raise the $12.7 million used to locate and excavate the ship said they were excluded from the profits. When a warrant was issued for Thompson’s arrest in August 2012, he and his longtime administrative assistant and girlfriend Alison Antekeier disappeared. To pull off their life in hiding, the couple did everything by the book. From what law enforcement officials could tell, Thompson and Antekeier were practiced students of “tradecraft.” Before they became fugitives, they had lived under the radar for six years — that is, if living in a Florida mansion could be considered a surreptitious lifestyle. They paid rent for the multi-million dollar Vero Beach property in cold, sweaty cash that had become damp and moldy after being buried underground, according to court documents from 2013 that were unsealed this week. Thompson kept at least 12 disposable cellphones — each assigned to a different person or purpose. Also found in the house were money straps stamped with “$10,000,” a bank statement bearing one of Thompson’s pseudonyms with a balance of $1 million, and a book called “How to be Invisible,” which details how to evade law enforcement. At one point, the rental agent arrived at the property and found an unforgettable scene. “Tommy was in the cabana,” the agent, Vance Brinkerhoff, told the Columbus Dispatch. “When he came out, the only thing he was wearing was a pair of leather shoes, black socks and a pair of filthy underwear.” By the time a handyman for the property realized who they were — after seeing media coverage of the contentious legal proceedings between Thompson and his investors — the couple had already packed up the few belongings they would take with them and high-tailed it out of town. “They lived like squatters in there,” said James Kennedy, who tipped off agents about what Thompson and Antekeier had left behind, according to the Dispatch. “There’s nothing living there now but rats and cockroaches, and there’s junk everywhere.” Armed with an enormous amount of money, a frightening intellect and a meticulousness that baffled the investigators hunting for him, Thompson had disappeared. He wasn’t seen again until Tuesday, when he and Antekeier were arrested at a Hilton Hotel in Boca Raton. Investigators, following the developing trail of dozens of leads, began closing in on the couple in the West Palm Beach area in December. They rarely left the hotel — and when they did, they primarily moved around town by foot, bus and taxi. Usually, though, it was Antekeier stepping out alone, leaving Thompson behind. During one such outing on Tuesday, investigators tracked Antekeier for hours until she led them back to the hotel where she and Thompson had been living for nearly two years, in a more than $200-a-night suite booked under Antekeier’s fake name. The two fugitives were arrested without incident. Thompson, agents said, did not try to hide his true identity. He appeared in a Florida court on Tuesday and told the magistrate that he intended to fight extradition to Ohio — where he faces long-delayed civil and, now, criminal legal proceedings — because, he said, an illness he contracted some years ago from a mosquito in South America would be exacerbated by being forced to go to colder climates, according to the Associated Press. He is scheduled to appear in court again on Wednesday. Antekeier will appear before the magistrate that same day. Both Thompson and Antekeier are being held without bond. It is a stunning fall for a man who, for most of his life, left many who knew him in awe of his intellect, ingenuity and determination — all of which helped lead him to the sunken treasure aboard the S.S. Central America.    This undated drawing shows the U.S. Mail ship S.S. Central America, which sank in September 1857. (Library of Congress via AP)  The 19th century vessel was the stuff of legends. Known as the Ship of Gold, it was carrying about 21 tons of gold in its underbelly when it wrecked off the coast of South Carolina in 1857 during a hurricane, killing more than 400 and sending a California Gold Rush fortune to the seafloor. Then came Thompson more than 130 years later, to do what no one else had been able to accomplish. “He set out to find the Central America in the middle of a whole vast expanse of nothing and found it, and did it with relative ease,” U.S. Marshals agent Mark Stroh told the Associated Press. It was, Stroh said, “like he was trying to find a set of car keys he misplaced in his house, but the house is hundreds of miles of ocean.” Thompson had raised millions of dollars from investors, known as the Columbus-America Discovery Group, and with the help of a device he created, called Nemo, he finally found the gold, the Columbus Monthly wrote in 1989: In just a couple of months, Nemo found and recovered the Central America’s 300-pound ships’ bell, proving once and for all that Tommy Thompson’s group had found the right site. Then Nemo recovered the first few pieces of gold. It was that gold, two coins and one bar, that Thompson showed to nearly 100 investors at the Athletic Club in the fall of 1988. The project is a success, he told them. But please, keep it quiet. And, amazingly, they did. Through the winter of 1988-’89, it was as if the Columbus-America Discovery Group had vanished. But when an even better Nemo, equipped with zoom video cameras and still more sophisticated equipment, began hauling up large quantities of gold last summer, Thompson decided the time had finally come to tell the world about his triumph. But the sudden wealth proved to be too much, and his friends and family told the AP that it contributed to his 1991 divorce. Thompson was beset by legal troubles. A slew of insurance companies claiming ownership of the gold sued, claiming they had insured it in the 1800s. Then, after Thompson reportedly sold many of the gold bars and coins to a marketing company for $50 million in 2000, investors who funded the expedition — most of them from Ohio — sued, claiming they never saw their profits. With his arrest this week, Thompson’s legal troubles will continue, bigger than ever. “If he had to do it all over again, he wouldn’t do it,” said his cousin, Ted Thomas, who attended Thursday’s hearing. “You don’t throw away your life for something that’s yellow and weighs a lot.”    A coin collector peers at a gold ingot recovered from the S.S. Central America shipwreck.

Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is a United States Republican politician who was a state legislator in Wisconsin, and 42nd Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001, and is the longest serving governor in the state's history. During his term as governor he was the chairman of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001–05, appointed by George W. Bush. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson was a partner with the law-firm Akin Gump and Chairman of Deloitte's global healthcare practice and has served on the board of 22 other organizations.[1]
Thompson was a candidate for the U.S. Presidential election in 2008, though he withdrew from the race before the primaries.[2] In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in Wisconsin, hoping to replace retiring Democrat Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Tammy Baldwin, making it his first statewide loss.[3]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Childhood and family[edit]
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin.[4][5]
His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store.[6][7][8] His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in 2002.[9]
Education[edit]
Thompson earned his bachelor and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively.[4][5] While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.[10][11][12]
Vietnam and military service[edit]
Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966.[13] The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.[13]
After completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years.[14][15] His final rank was captain.[15]
Early political career (1966–1987)[edit]
Wisconsin Assembly[edit]
Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly.[13] In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.[13]
In 1973, Thompson became the Assembly's assistant minority leader and, in 1981, its minority leader.[16] Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname "Dr. No" by the frustrated majority.[17][18]
American Legislative Exchange Council[edit]
As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization.[19][20][21][22] Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: "I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I'd take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, 'That's mine.'"[19][20][21] ALEC awarded Thompson its "Thomas Jefferson Award" in 1991.[23]
1979 congressional election[edit]
While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin's 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack.[24] Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979.[25] Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.
Governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)[edit]
Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,141 days.[26]
Elections[edit]

1986

See also: United States gubernatorial elections, 1986; United States gubernatorial elections, 1990; United States gubernatorial elections, 1994; and United States gubernatorial elections, 1998
Thompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field.[27] He defeated Earl 53%–46%.[28]

1990

Thompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.[29]

1994

Thompson won election to a third term defeating Democrat State Senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.[30]

1998

Thompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.[31]
Tenure[edit]




Then-Governor Thompson meets President Bill Clinton, 1993


Thompson is best known nationally for pushing his state to overhaul its welfare system.[18] These reforms were implemented and pioneered before Congress and President Clinton undertook national reform of the program.[18] Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.[18] Thompson was called a "pioneer" for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers.[32][33] In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country's first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don't provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.[citation needed]
Thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.[34]
Thompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[18] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggested that "Many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare." Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[18]
The growth of the state budget during Thompson's 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.[35]
Transportation focus[edit]
While governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001[36][37][38] through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.[39]
Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans.[18] Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be Secretary of Transportation.[18]
Taxes[edit]
In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin.[13] Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987,[40] cutting income tax rates three times[41] and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.[42][43]
When Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he "never raised taxes", he earned a rating of "False" from PolitiFact-Wisconsin.[43] PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson's terms. Politifact said in its rating, "Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way." Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson's claim that Wisconsin's overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.[43]
Two of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor's partial-veto power, were taxes on the state's wealthiest residents.[13] In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy,[13] at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits.[13]
Executive power consolidation[edit]
As governor, Thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees.[13] Among the changes:

Consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the Wisconsin Department of Justice and transferred to Thompson's appointee at the Department of Agriculture
The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor had its budget greatly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.
Education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the move unconstitutional.[13]

Thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional.[13] His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional.[13] Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, "despite a clear ruling" from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.[13]
Tobacco[edit]
As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests.[18] His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris.[18] He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and "delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.[18]
Abortion[edit]
Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.[18]
Treatment of Ojibwa spearfishers[edit]
In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its "Voigt Decision", which found that Wisconsin's Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land.[44] The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.[44][45]
During his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa's rights.[44] Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million.[44] Thompson's administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the "Voigt Decision".[44] The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans' lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.[44]
In 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration's legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger.[45] Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992.[46] On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.[44]
Other leadership roles[edit]
During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States,[13] in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.
Vice presidential discussion[edit]
Thompson's name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.[13]
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position.[13] However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to "bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements", and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson's lack of finesse in their interactions.[13]
After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been "scared to death" of the process and the spotlight of the position.[47]
Health and Human Services Secretary[edit]




Thompson at the 2004 HealthierUS summit


Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001 Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004,[48] and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.
While Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,[48] reorganize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests and thereby provide health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans.[49] In the aftermath of 9–11 he also worked on strengthening the nation's preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.[50]
Key initiatives[edit]
Thompson's major initiatives were "efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes."[51]
Medicare prescription drug-benefit[edit]
Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush's Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush's first term, Thompson frequently served as the president's point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson's tenure as HHS secretary.[52]
As part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken.[53] In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.[54]
2001 anthrax scare[edit]
Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming "utterly overtaken by events" and issuing "early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts."[55]
At a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that "would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication."[56] Thompson offered the media a "far-fetched" suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.[57] Thompson's words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, potentially undermining public confidence, and as the "kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts."[58][59] Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.[56]
Politicizing of science[edit]
In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson's office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit's director.[60] In return, Thompson's office sent back to the unit's director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as "lightweights" with "no scientific credibility." Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having "signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush."[61] This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a "politicization of science" under President George W. Bush's administration.[62][63]
Resignation press conference[edit]
Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists.[51] Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President's reelection at the administration's request.[64][65][66] Some noted, in particular, his words: "I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that."[51]
Post-government career[edit]
After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.[1][67]
Thompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.[68]
In 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson's consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson's work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.[68]
A number of those companies and organizations "he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors." An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that "either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight."[68]
Health care consulting and Law Firm[edit]
Thompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying.[1] There, Thompson provided "strategic advice" to the lobbyists in the firm's health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm's clients.[1]
He also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Care Management and Transformation.[67][69] Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.[67]
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Thompson endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[70]
ADS board membership[edit]
Shortly after leaving his Bush Cabinet post, Thompson joined and served for two years on the board of directors of Applied Digital Solutions, makers of the controversial VeriChip: a glass-encapsulated RFID chip that can be injected into human flesh for various database-driven identification purposes.[71] The FDA issued approval to the device while its parent agency, DHHS, was headed by Thompson, who became a board member of ADS within five months. He received shares of stock in ADS, and compensation, leading the non-profit advocacy group Project on Government Oversight to characterize Thompson's actions "unacceptable" and embarrassing, although unfortunately entirely legal.[71]
Medicare[edit]
After leaving office, Thompson began offering policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary.[72] However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions).[72] These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.[72]
Public interest activities[edit]
Thompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Kennedy School of Government conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy.[73] Thompson also authored a Boston Globe op-ed on the topic.[74]
One of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, Plain Talk about Health.[75]
2008 Presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Tommy Thompson presidential campaign, 2008
After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.[76]
Statement about sexual orientation and workplace protections[edit]
During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker.[77] He said, "I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be." He called CNN the following morning to say he did not hear the question correctly. He apologized, saying, "It's not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace."
Political contributions[edit]
Thompson made campaign contributions to two Democrats in 2008[78] – $250 to Michigan Senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for Governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year's elections. All told, Thompson contributed $11,350 to Republican candidates for federal office in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles, while contributing another $4,900 to Wisconsin Republicans during those same cycles.
Gaffe about Jews, Israel[edit]


“
I'm in the private sector and for the first time in my life I'm earning money. You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that. [...]
I just want to clarify something because I didn't in any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.
”


— Tommy Thompson, address to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism – Consultation on Conscience, Washington, DC, April 16, 2007




“
Thompson was courting public support, not trying to alienate people—which means he somehow believed that repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners! There could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes have become.
”


— Abraham Foxman, National Director, Anti-Defamation League, Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype (Macmillan, 2010, p. 139)


In April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.[79]
On April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector[80][81] and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance.[82] Thompson stated: "You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that."[81] Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments,[83] adding: "I just want to clarify something because I didn't (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that."[81] Thompson's comments caused "unease in the room" as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson's use of this stereotype.[80][82]
Thompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as "Jewish bonds".[80][84][85] He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group[80][84]
Conference organizers noted the unease with Thompson's words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.[86]
The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that "there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become" than Thompson's belief that "repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!"[82]
After the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold.[79] Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.[80][84]
Iowa Straw Poll[edit]
Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race.[citation needed]
Endorses Giuliani[edit]
In October 2007, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that "Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership." He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani's withdrawal from the presidential race.[87] In a New York Times article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain's campaign as saying, "No. I don't know who is."[88]
2012 U.S. Senate election[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2012
On September 19, 2011; Thompson announced he would run for the seat vacated by Sen. Herb Kohl,[89] formally announcing on December 1, 2011. He won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012 after a bitter four-way primary battle against a field which included millionaire hedge fund manager Eric Hovde, former Congressman Mark Neumann and Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.[90]
The attacks on Thompson led to his defense and endorsement by former Arkansas governor, presidential candidate, and conservative media figure Mike Huckabee.[91]
ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson's bid for US Senate in the autumn of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, taking 45.9 percent to Baldwin's 51.5 percent. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state's two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.[citation needed]
Political positions[edit]
During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, "who better than me, that’s already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?"[92] When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare, but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.[92]
Thompson favors making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15 percent flat tax.[93]

The latter was a second-year law student named Tom Thompson from Elroy, Wisconsin, who testified despite having qualms about 'the wisdom, advisability, and intent' of the gathering. 'If this hearing is to take up that question of abandonment – if it is only to hear the cries of appeasement from people who cannot find enough distaste for communism to fight it – then this hearing does not serve a purpose, that is, no other purpose than to weaken dangerously the determination of our country and its people at a time when great determination and strong moral courage are demanded as fitting examples of democracy.'

[...] Earlier this fall the [American Chemistry Council] poured nearly 650,000 dollars into supporting Wisconsin republican Tommy Thompson’s bid for the U.S. Senate this November. By now it won’t surprise you to learn that Wisconsin's former governor has been a friend of ALEC going all the way back to his days as a state legislator, when he himself was an ALEC member. Take a listen to a speech Thompson made at an ALEC conference in 2002: Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson: I always loved going to those meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I’d take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare that's mine.

Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is a United States Republican politician who was a state legislator in Wisconsin, and 42nd Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001, and is the longest serving governor in the state's history. During his term as governor he was the chairman of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001–05, appointed by George W. Bush. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson was a partner with the law-firm Akin Gump and Chairman of Deloitte's global healthcare practice and has served on the board of 22 other organizations.[1]
Thompson was a candidate for the U.S. Presidential election in 2008, though he withdrew from the race before the primaries.[2] In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in Wisconsin, hoping to replace retiring Democrat Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Tammy Baldwin, making it his first statewide loss.[3]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Childhood and family[edit]
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin.[4][5]
His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store.[6][7][8] His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in 2002.[9]
Education[edit]
Thompson earned his bachelor and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively.[4][5] While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.[10][11][12]
Vietnam and military service[edit]
Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966.[13] The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.[13]
After completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years.[14][15] His final rank was captain.[15]
Early political career (1966–1987)[edit]
Wisconsin Assembly[edit]
Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly.[13] In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.[13]
In 1973, Thompson became the Assembly's assistant minority leader and, in 1981, its minority leader.[16] Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname "Dr. No" by the frustrated majority.[17][18]
American Legislative Exchange Council[edit]
As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization.[19][20][21][22] Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: "I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I'd take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, 'That's mine.'"[19][20][21] ALEC awarded Thompson its "Thomas Jefferson Award" in 1991.[23]
1979 congressional election[edit]
While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin's 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack.[24] Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979.[25] Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.
Governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)[edit]
Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,141 days.[26]
Elections[edit]

1986

See also: United States gubernatorial elections, 1986; United States gubernatorial elections, 1990; United States gubernatorial elections, 1994; and United States gubernatorial elections, 1998
Thompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field.[27] He defeated Earl 53%–46%.[28]

1990

Thompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.[29]

1994

Thompson won election to a third term defeating Democrat State Senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.[30]

1998

Thompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.[31]
Tenure[edit]




Then-Governor Thompson meets President Bill Clinton, 1993


Thompson is best known nationally for pushing his state to overhaul its welfare system.[18] These reforms were implemented and pioneered before Congress and President Clinton undertook national reform of the program.[18] Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.[18] Thompson was called a "pioneer" for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers.[32][33] In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country's first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don't provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.[citation needed]
Thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.[34]
Thompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[18] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggested that "Many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare." Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[18]
The growth of the state budget during Thompson's 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.[35]
Transportation focus[edit]
While governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001[36][37][38] through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.[39]
Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans.[18] Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be Secretary of Transportation.[18]
Taxes[edit]
In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin.[13] Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987,[40] cutting income tax rates three times[41] and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.[42][43]
When Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he "never raised taxes", he earned a rating of "False" from PolitiFact-Wisconsin.[43] PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson's terms. Politifact said in its rating, "Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way." Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson's claim that Wisconsin's overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.[43]
Two of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor's partial-veto power, were taxes on the state's wealthiest residents.[13] In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy,[13] at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits.[13]
Executive power consolidation[edit]
As governor, Thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees.[13] Among the changes:

Consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the Wisconsin Department of Justice and transferred to Thompson's appointee at the Department of Agriculture
The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor had its budget greatly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.
Education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the move unconstitutional.[13]

Thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional.[13] His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional.[13] Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, "despite a clear ruling" from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.[13]
Tobacco[edit]
As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests.[18] His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris.[18] He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and "delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.[18]
Abortion[edit]
Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.[18]
Treatment of Ojibwa spearfishers[edit]
In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its "Voigt Decision", which found that Wisconsin's Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land.[44] The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.[44][45]
During his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa's rights.[44] Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million.[44] Thompson's administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the "Voigt Decision".[44] The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans' lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.[44]
In 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration's legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger.[45] Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992.[46] On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.[44]
Other leadership roles[edit]
During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States,[13] in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.
Vice presidential discussion[edit]
Thompson's name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.[13]
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position.[13] However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to "bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements", and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson's lack of finesse in their interactions.[13]
After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been "scared to death" of the process and the spotlight of the position.[47]
Health and Human Services Secretary[edit]




Thompson at the 2004 HealthierUS summit


Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001 Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004,[48] and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.
While Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,[48] reorganize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests and thereby provide health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans.[49] In the aftermath of 9–11 he also worked on strengthening the nation's preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.[50]
Key initiatives[edit]
Thompson's major initiatives were "efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes."[51]
Medicare prescription drug-benefit[edit]
Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush's Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush's first term, Thompson frequently served as the president's point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson's tenure as HHS secretary.[52]
As part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken.[53] In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.[54]
2001 anthrax scare[edit]
Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming "utterly overtaken by events" and issuing "early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts."[55]
At a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that "would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication."[56] Thompson offered the media a "far-fetched" suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.[57] Thompson's words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, potentially undermining public confidence, and as the "kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts."[58][59] Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.[56]
Politicizing of science[edit]
In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson's office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit's director.[60] In return, Thompson's office sent back to the unit's director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as "lightweights" with "no scientific credibility." Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having "signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush."[61] This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a "politicization of science" under President George W. Bush's administration.[62][63]
Resignation press conference[edit]
Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists.[51] Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President's reelection at the administration's request.[64][65][66] Some noted, in particular, his words: "I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that."[51]
Post-government career[edit]
After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.[1][67]
Thompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.[68]
In 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson's consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson's work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.[68]
A number of those companies and organizations "he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors." An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that "either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight."[68]
Health care consulting and Law Firm[edit]
Thompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying.[1] There, Thompson provided "strategic advice" to the lobbyists in the firm's health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm's clients.[1]
He also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Care Management and Transformation.[67][69] Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.[67]
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Thompson endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[70]
ADS board membership[edit]
Shortly after leaving his Bush Cabinet post, Thompson joined and served for two years on the board of directors of Applied Digital Solutions, makers of the controversial VeriChip: a glass-encapsulated RFID chip that can be injected into human flesh for various database-driven identification purposes.[71] The FDA issued approval to the device while its parent agency, DHHS, was headed by Thompson, who became a board member of ADS within five months. He received shares of stock in ADS, and compensation, leading the non-profit advocacy group Project on Government Oversight to characterize Thompson's actions "unacceptable" and embarrassing, although unfortunately entirely legal.[71]
Medicare[edit]
After leaving office, Thompson began offering policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary.[72] However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions).[72] These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.[72]
Public interest activities[edit]
Thompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Kennedy School of Government conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy.[73] Thompson also authored a Boston Globe op-ed on the topic.[74]
One of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, Plain Talk about Health.[75]
2008 Presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Tommy Thompson presidential campaign, 2008
After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.[76]
Statement about sexual orientation and workplace protections[edit]
During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker.[77] He said, "I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be." He called CNN the following morning to say he did not hear the question correctly. He apologized, saying, "It's not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace."
Political contributions[edit]
Thompson made campaign contributions to two Democrats in 2008[78] – $250 to Michigan Senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for Governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year's elections. All told, Thompson contributed $11,350 to Republican candidates for federal office in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles, while contributing another $4,900 to Wisconsin Republicans during those same cycles.
Gaffe about Jews, Israel[edit]


“
I'm in the private sector and for the first time in my life I'm earning money. You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that. [...]
I just want to clarify something because I didn't in any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.
”


— Tommy Thompson, address to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism – Consultation on Conscience, Washington, DC, April 16, 2007




“
Thompson was courting public support, not trying to alienate people—which means he somehow believed that repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners! There could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes have become.
”


— Abraham Foxman, National Director, Anti-Defamation League, Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype (Macmillan, 2010, p. 139)


In April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.[79]
On April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector[80][81] and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance.[82] Thompson stated: "You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that."[81] Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments,[83] adding: "I just want to clarify something because I didn't (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that."[81] Thompson's comments caused "unease in the room" as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson's use of this stereotype.[80][82]
Thompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as "Jewish bonds".[80][84][85] He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group[80][84]
Conference organizers noted the unease with Thompson's words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.[86]
The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that "there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become" than Thompson's belief that "repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!"[82]
After the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold.[79] Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.[80][84]
Iowa Straw Poll[edit]
Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race.[citation needed]
Endorses Giuliani[edit]
In October 2007, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that "Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership." He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani's withdrawal from the presidential race.[87] In a New York Times article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain's campaign as saying, "No. I don't know who is."[88]
2012 U.S. Senate election[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2012
On September 19, 2011; Thompson announced he would run for the seat vacated by Sen. Herb Kohl,[89] formally announcing on December 1, 2011. He won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012 after a bitter four-way primary battle against a field which included millionaire hedge fund manager Eric Hovde, former Congressman Mark Neumann and Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.[90]
The attacks on Thompson led to his defense and endorsement by former Arkansas governor, presidential candidate, and conservative media figure Mike Huckabee.[91]
ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson's bid for US Senate in the autumn of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, taking 45.9 percent to Baldwin's 51.5 percent. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state's two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.[citation needed]
Political positions[edit]
During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, "who better than me, that’s already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?"[92] When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare, but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.[92]
Thompson favors making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15 percent flat tax.[93]

'If this hearing is to take up that question of abandonment – if it is only to hear the cries of appeasement from people who cannot find enough distaste for communism to fight it – then this hearing does not serve a purpose, that is, no other purpose than to weaken dangerously the determination of our country and its people at a time when great determination and strong moral courage are demanded as fitting examples of democracy.'

By now it won’t surprise you to learn that Wisconsin's former governor has been a friend of ALEC going all the way back to his days as a state legislator, when he himself was an ALEC member. Take a listen to a speech Thompson made at an ALEC conference in 2002: Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson: I always loved going to those meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I’d take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare that's mine.

Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is a United States Republican politician who was a state legislator in Wisconsin, and 42nd Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001, and is the longest serving governor in the state's history. During his term as governor he was the chairman of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001–05, appointed by George W. Bush. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson was a partner with the law-firm Akin Gump and Chairman of Deloitte's global healthcare practice and has served on the board of 22 other organizations.[1]
Thompson was a candidate for the U.S. Presidential election in 2008, though he withdrew from the race before the primaries.[2] In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in Wisconsin, hoping to replace retiring Democrat Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Tammy Baldwin, making it his first statewide loss.[3]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Childhood and family[edit]
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin.[4][5]
His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store.[6][7][8] His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in 2002.[9]
Education[edit]
Thompson earned his bachelor and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively.[4][5] While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.[10][11][12]
Vietnam and military service[edit]
Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966.[13] The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.[13]
After completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years.[14][15] His final rank was captain.[15]
Early political career (1966–1987)[edit]
Wisconsin Assembly[edit]
Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly.[13] In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.[13]
In 1973, Thompson became the Assembly's assistant minority leader and, in 1981, its minority leader.[16] Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname "Dr. No" by the frustrated majority.[17][18]
American Legislative Exchange Council[edit]
As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization.[19][20][21][22] Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: "I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I'd take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, 'That's mine.'"[19][20][21] ALEC awarded Thompson its "Thomas Jefferson Award" in 1991.[23]
1979 congressional election[edit]
While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin's 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack.[24] Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979.[25] Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.
Governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)[edit]
Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,141 days.[26]
Elections[edit]

1986

See also: United States gubernatorial elections, 1986; United States gubernatorial elections, 1990; United States gubernatorial elections, 1994; and United States gubernatorial elections, 1998
Thompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field.[27] He defeated Earl 53%–46%.[28]

1990

Thompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.[29]

1994

Thompson won election to a third term defeating Democrat State Senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.[30]

1998

Thompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.[31]
Tenure[edit]




Then-Governor Thompson meets President Bill Clinton, 1993


Thompson is best known nationally for pushing his state to overhaul its welfare system.[18] These reforms were implemented and pioneered before Congress and President Clinton undertook national reform of the program.[18] Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.[18] Thompson was called a "pioneer" for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers.[32][33] In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country's first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don't provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.[citation needed]
Thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.[34]
Thompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[18] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggested that "Many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare." Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[18]
The growth of the state budget during Thompson's 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.[35]
Transportation focus[edit]
While governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001[36][37][38] through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.[39]
Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans.[18] Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be Secretary of Transportation.[18]
Taxes[edit]
In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin.[13] Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987,[40] cutting income tax rates three times[41] and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.[42][43]
When Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he "never raised taxes", he earned a rating of "False" from PolitiFact-Wisconsin.[43] PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson's terms. Politifact said in its rating, "Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way." Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson's claim that Wisconsin's overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.[43]
Two of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor's partial-veto power, were taxes on the state's wealthiest residents.[13] In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy,[13] at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits.[13]
Executive power consolidation[edit]
As governor, Thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees.[13] Among the changes:

Consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the Wisconsin Department of Justice and transferred to Thompson's appointee at the Department of Agriculture
The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor had its budget greatly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.
Education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the move unconstitutional.[13]

Thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional.[13] His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional.[13] Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, "despite a clear ruling" from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.[13]
Tobacco[edit]
As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests.[18] His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris.[18] He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and "delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.[18]
Abortion[edit]
Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.[18]
Treatment of Ojibwa spearfishers[edit]
In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its "Voigt Decision", which found that Wisconsin's Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land.[44] The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.[44][45]
During his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa's rights.[44] Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million.[44] Thompson's administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the "Voigt Decision".[44] The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans' lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.[44]
In 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration's legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger.[45] Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992.[46] On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.[44]
Other leadership roles[edit]
During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States,[13] in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.
Vice presidential discussion[edit]
Thompson's name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.[13]
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position.[13] However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to "bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements", and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson's lack of finesse in their interactions.[13]
After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been "scared to death" of the process and the spotlight of the position.[47]
Health and Human Services Secretary[edit]




Thompson at the 2004 HealthierUS summit


Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001 Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004,[48] and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.
While Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,[48] reorganize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests and thereby provide health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans.[49] In the aftermath of 9–11 he also worked on strengthening the nation's preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.[50]
Key initiatives[edit]
Thompson's major initiatives were "efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes."[51]
Medicare prescription drug-benefit[edit]
Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush's Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush's first term, Thompson frequently served as the president's point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson's tenure as HHS secretary.[52]
As part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken.[53] In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.[54]
2001 anthrax scare[edit]
Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming "utterly overtaken by events" and issuing "early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts."[55]
At a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that "would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication."[56] Thompson offered the media a "far-fetched" suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.[57] Thompson's words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, potentially undermining public confidence, and as the "kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts."[58][59] Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.[56]
Politicizing of science[edit]
In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson's office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit's director.[60] In return, Thompson's office sent back to the unit's director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as "lightweights" with "no scientific credibility." Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having "signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush."[61] This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a "politicization of science" under President George W. Bush's administration.[62][63]
Resignation press conference[edit]
Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists.[51] Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President's reelection at the administration's request.[64][65][66] Some noted, in particular, his words: "I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that."[51]
Post-government career[edit]
After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.[1][67]
Thompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.[68]
In 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson's consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson's work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.[68]
A number of those companies and organizations "he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors." An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that "either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight."[68]
Health care consulting and Law Firm[edit]
Thompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying.[1] There, Thompson provided "strategic advice" to the lobbyists in the firm's health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm's clients.[1]
He also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Care Management and Transformation.[67][69] Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.[67]
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Thompson endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[70]
ADS board membership[edit]
Shortly after leaving his Bush Cabinet post, Thompson joined and served for two years on the board of directors of Applied Digital Solutions, makers of the controversial VeriChip: a glass-encapsulated RFID chip that can be injected into human flesh for various database-driven identification purposes.[71] The FDA issued approval to the device while its parent agency, DHHS, was headed by Thompson, who became a board member of ADS within five months. He received shares of stock in ADS, and compensation, leading the non-profit advocacy group Project on Government Oversight to characterize Thompson's actions "unacceptable" and embarrassing, although unfortunately entirely legal.[71]
Medicare[edit]
After leaving office, Thompson began offering policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary.[72] However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions).[72] These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.[72]
Public interest activities[edit]
Thompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Kennedy School of Government conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy.[73] Thompson also authored a Boston Globe op-ed on the topic.[74]
One of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, Plain Talk about Health.[75]
2008 Presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Tommy Thompson presidential campaign, 2008
After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.[76]
Statement about sexual orientation and workplace protections[edit]
During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker.[77] He said, "I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be." He called CNN the following morning to say he did not hear the question correctly. He apologized, saying, "It's not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace."
Political contributions[edit]
Thompson made campaign contributions to two Democrats in 2008[78] – $250 to Michigan Senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for Governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year's elections. All told, Thompson contributed $11,350 to Republican candidates for federal office in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles, while contributing another $4,900 to Wisconsin Republicans during those same cycles.
Gaffe about Jews, Israel[edit]


“
I'm in the private sector and for the first time in my life I'm earning money. You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that. [...]
I just want to clarify something because I didn't in any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.
”


— Tommy Thompson, address to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism – Consultation on Conscience, Washington, DC, April 16, 2007




“
Thompson was courting public support, not trying to alienate people—which means he somehow believed that repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners! There could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes have become.
”


— Abraham Foxman, National Director, Anti-Defamation League, Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype (Macmillan, 2010, p. 139)


In April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.[79]
On April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector[80][81] and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance.[82] Thompson stated: "You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that."[81] Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments,[83] adding: "I just want to clarify something because I didn't (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that."[81] Thompson's comments caused "unease in the room" as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson's use of this stereotype.[80][82]
Thompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as "Jewish bonds".[80][84][85] He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group[80][84]
Conference organizers noted the unease with Thompson's words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.[86]
The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that "there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become" than Thompson's belief that "repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!"[82]
After the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold.[79] Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.[80][84]
Iowa Straw Poll[edit]
Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race.[citation needed]
Endorses Giuliani[edit]
In October 2007, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that "Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership." He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani's withdrawal from the presidential race.[87] In a New York Times article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain's campaign as saying, "No. I don't know who is."[88]
2012 U.S. Senate election[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2012
On September 19, 2011; Thompson announced he would run for the seat vacated by Sen. Herb Kohl,[89] formally announcing on December 1, 2011. He won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012 after a bitter four-way primary battle against a field which included millionaire hedge fund manager Eric Hovde, former Congressman Mark Neumann and Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.[90]
The attacks on Thompson led to his defense and endorsement by former Arkansas governor, presidential candidate, and conservative media figure Mike Huckabee.[91]
ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson's bid for US Senate in the autumn of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, taking 45.9 percent to Baldwin's 51.5 percent. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state's two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.[citation needed]
Political positions[edit]
During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, "who better than me, that’s already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?"[92] When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare, but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.[92]
Thompson favors making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15 percent flat tax.[93]

 The information about this individual is current as of when his or her last campaign ended. Please contact us with any updates.
Tommy Thompson (b. November 19, 1941) was a 2012 Republican candidate who sought election to the U.S. Senate from Wisconsin. He lost in the general election.[1]
Biography
Thompson was previously the governor of Wisconsin and served as Secretary of Health and Human Services under George W. Bush.[2]

Issues
Tommy outlined his RESTORE plan on his campaign website:[3]
"Governor Thompson has announced RESTORE policy initiatives that tackle our country’s most pressing economic issues, including:

Tackling our burgeoning debt through entitlement and budget reform;
Repealing Obamacare and replacing it with market-based solutions;
Boosting our economy through tax simplification and reduction;
Reforming our budget process and cutting wasteful spending, such as excessive federal worker pay; and
Enacting a pro-growth energy policy."
Elections
Presidential preference
2016 presidential endorsement
✓ Thompson endorsed John Kasich for the Republican primary in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[4]

See also: Endorsements for John Kasich



2012
 See also: United States Senate elections in Wisconsin, 2012
Thompson ran in the 2012 election for the U.S. Senate, representing Wisconsin. He ran on the Republican ticket,[5] having defeated Mark Neumann, Jeff Fitzgerald, and Eric Hovde in the August 14 Republican primary.[6] He lost to Tammy Baldwin (D) in the general election.[1]
The University of Virginia's Center for Politics published an article called Sabato's Crystal Ball on March 22, 2012, detailing the eight races in the Senate in 2012 that would decide the political fate of which party will end up with control in 2013.[7] The seat, rated a toss-up, was one that the Sabato's Crystal Ball believed could be decided by the party's nomination. The articles believed Thompson would have a significant edge in the general election.[7] According to the article, "Given the current state of these toss ups, it’s not a stretch to think that a Thompson victory in Wisconsin could end up giving Republicans their 51st Senate seat."[7]
Two Democratic political action committees, Majority PAC and Women Vote! spent money running ads against Hovde and Thompson.  Majority PAC spent $370,000 and Women Vote! spent $420,000.  Overall, $3.4 million were spent by outside groups about Republican candidates in the senate primary race.[8]

2016 Republican National Convention
See also: Republican National Convention, 2016
Thompson was  an at-large delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention from Wisconsin. Thompson was one of 36 delegates from Wisconsin bound by state party rules to support Ted Cruz at the convention.[12] Cruz suspended his campaign on May 3, 2016. At the time, he had approximately 546 bound delegates. For more on what happened to his delegates, see this page.

Delegate rules
See also: RNC delegate guidelines from Wisconsin, 2016 and Republican delegates from Wisconsin, 2016
At-large delegates from Wisconsin to the Republican National Convention were selected by a committee formed by the candidate who received a plurality of the statewide vote in the state presidential primary election and ratified by the State Executive Committee. For district-level delegates, the district chairman of each district compiled a list of delegates from which the presidential candidate who won a plurality of the vote in that district selected three delegates. Delegates from Wisconsin were bound to a candidate on all ballots at the convention unless the candidate released them or failed to receive one-third of the vote on a ballot.

Delegate allocation
See also: 2016 presidential nominations: calendar and delegate rules

Wisconsin had 42 delegates at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Of this total, 24 were district-level delegates (three for each of the state's eight congressional districts). District delegates were allocated on a winner-take-all basis; the candidate who won a plurality of the vote in a congressional district received all of that district's delegates.[13][14]
Of the remaining 18 delegates, 15 served at large. Wisconsin's at-large delegates were allocated on a winner-take-all basis. The candidate who won a plurality of the statewide vote received all of the state's at-large delegates. In addition, three national party leaders (identified on the chart below as RNC delegates) served as bound delegates to the Republican National Convention.[13][14]



Personal
Thompson is married with three children and eight grandchildren.[15]

Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is a United States Republican politician who was a state legislator in Wisconsin, and 42nd Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001, and is the longest serving governor in the state's history. During his term as governor he was the chairman of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001–05, appointed by George W. Bush. After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson was a partner with the law-firm Akin Gump and Chairman of Deloitte's global healthcare practice and has served on the board of 22 other organizations.[1]
Thompson was a candidate for the U.S. Presidential election in 2008, though he withdrew from the race before the primaries.[2] In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in Wisconsin, hoping to replace retiring Democrat Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Tammy Baldwin, making it his first statewide loss.[3]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Childhood and family[edit]
Thompson was born in Elroy, Wisconsin.[4][5]
His mother, Julie (née Dutton), was a teacher, and his father, Allan Thompson, owned and ran a gas station and country grocery store.[6][7][8] His brother, the late Ed Thompson, was a mayor of Tomah, Wisconsin, and was the Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Wisconsin in 2002.[9]
Education[edit]
Thompson earned his bachelor and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1963 and 1966, respectively.[4][5] While in law school, Thompson was elected chairman of the Madison Young Republicans.[10][11][12]
Vietnam and military service[edit]
Thompson held a student deferment from military service during the Vietnam War until he completed law school in June 1966.[13] The following year, 1966, Thompson enlisted in the National Guard.[13]
After completing six years in the National Guard, Thompson served in the Army Reserves for another four years.[14][15] His final rank was captain.[15]
Early political career (1966–1987)[edit]
Wisconsin Assembly[edit]
Immediately after completing law school in 1966, Thompson ran for the Wisconsin State Assembly.[13] In the Republican primary, he defeated incumbent Assemblyman Louis Romell by 635 votes, after Romell had underestimated the challenge Thompson represented.[13]
In 1973, Thompson became the Assembly's assistant minority leader and, in 1981, its minority leader.[16] Thompson aggressively used parliamentary procedure to block bills favored by the Democratic majority and stop legislative progress, earning him the nickname "Dr. No" by the frustrated majority.[17][18]
American Legislative Exchange Council[edit]
As a state legislator, Thompson was involved in the early years of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative legislative organization.[19][20][21][22] Speaking at a 2002 ALEC meeting, Thompson stated: "I always loved going to [ALEC] meetings because I always found new ideas. Then I'd take them back to Wisconsin, disguise them a little bit, and declare, 'That's mine.'"[19][20][21] ALEC awarded Thompson its "Thomas Jefferson Award" in 1991.[23]
1979 congressional election[edit]
While Thompson was Assistant Minority Leader in the Assembly, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman William Steiger of Wisconsin's 6th congressional district died at the age of 40 from a heart attack.[24] Thompson was one of seven Republican candidates who ran to replace Steiger in the special election in 1979.[25] Tom Petri won the primary and general elections and represented the 6th district until his retirement in January 2015.
Governor of Wisconsin (1987–2001)[edit]
Thompson served as the 42nd Governor of Wisconsin, having been elected to an unprecedented four terms. As of April 2013, Thompson has the tenth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,141 days.[26]
Elections[edit]

1986

See also: United States gubernatorial elections, 1986; United States gubernatorial elections, 1990; United States gubernatorial elections, 1994; and United States gubernatorial elections, 1998
Thompson decided to run for Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 against incumbent Democrat Anthony Earl. He ran and won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote in a five candidate field.[27] He defeated Earl 53%–46%.[28]

1990

Thompson won election to a second term defeating Democrat Thomas Loftus, the Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, 58%–42%.[29]

1994

Thompson won election to a third term defeating Democrat State Senator Chuck Chvala 67%–31%. He won every county in the state except Menominee County.[30]

1998

Thompson won election to a fourth term defeating Democrat Ed Garvey, a Wisconsin Deputy Attorney General, 60%–39%.[31]
Tenure[edit]




Then-Governor Thompson meets President Bill Clinton, 1993


Thompson is best known nationally for pushing his state to overhaul its welfare system.[18] These reforms were implemented and pioneered before Congress and President Clinton undertook national reform of the program.[18] Under his leadership, Wisconsin reduced its welfare rolls by almost 90%, cutting welfare spending but increasing investments in child care and health care, especially for low-income working families.[18] Thompson was called a "pioneer" for two key initiatives of his governorship, the Wisconsin Works welfare reform (sometimes called W-2) and school vouchers.[32][33] In 1990 Thompson pushed for the creation of the country's first parental school-choice program, which provided Milwaukee families with a voucher to send children to the private or public school of their choice. He created the BadgerCare program, designed to provide health coverage to those families whose employers don't provide health insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Through the federal waiver program, Thompson helped replicate this program in several states when he became Secretary of Health and Human Services.[citation needed]
Thompson was well known for his extensive use of the veto, particularly his sweeping line-item veto powers. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills. In his first two terms alone, he used the line-item veto 1,500 times to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden.[34]
Thompson's welfare reform policies were criticized.[18] Wendell Primus of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggested that "Many families have actually lost ground even though they are no longer on welfare." Many of Wisconsin's poor remained well below the federal poverty line. In addition, slightly more of the state's poorest children reportedly lacked health insurance than before Thompson's welfare overhaul.[18]
The growth of the state budget during Thompson's 14-year tenure became a subject of attacks on his record as governor later by conservative opponents in the 2012 U.S. Senate primary.[35]
Transportation focus[edit]
While governor, Thompson was appointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors by President Bill Clinton, served as chairman, and had an Amtrak locomotive named for him from 2001[36][37][38] through 2006, when his name was removed from the side of the locomotive as part of a routine overhaul.[39]
Thompson is a rail enthusiast, and was a supporter of mass transit, which earned him distrust on the issue from other Republicans.[18] Prior to being selected as HHS Secretary, Thompson made clear that his first choice in the Bush Administration would be Secretary of Transportation.[18]
Taxes[edit]
In 1996, Thompson bragged that he never raised taxes in Wisconsin.[13] Thompson claimed to cut taxes 91 times—including eliminating the estate tax in 1987,[40] cutting income tax rates three times[41] and a $1.2 billion property tax cut in 1995.[42][43]
When Thompson made the same claim, in 2012, that he "never raised taxes", he earned a rating of "False" from PolitiFact-Wisconsin.[43] PolitiFact found numerous examples of taxes that had increased during Thompson's terms. Politifact said in its rating, "Thompson has a long list of taxes he cut and, on balance, he can claim to have reduced taxes. But he also raised some specific taxes along the way." Politifact rated Mostly True Thompson's claim that Wisconsin's overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001.[43]
Two of the tax increases that Thompson did fight, using the Wisconsin governor's partial-veto power, were taxes on the state's wealthiest residents.[13] In a budget bill in 1987, Thompson vetoed two tax increases on capital gains and the alternative minimum tax, that would have largely affected the wealthy,[13] at the same time that he pushed forward a cut a six percent cut in welfare benefits.[13]
Executive power consolidation[edit]
As governor, Thompson took major steps to move decision making power from career officials to his political appointees.[13] Among the changes:

Consumer protection issues were taken away from the control of the Wisconsin Department of Justice and transferred to Thompson's appointee at the Department of Agriculture
The Wisconsin Office of Public Intervenor had its budget greatly reduced, shrinking its staff and eliminating its power to sue in environmental cases; Thompson effectively shifted these powers to an appointed natural resources secretary.
Education issues were transferred to an appointed education secretary after the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and its elected superintendent saw their powers gutted. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the move unconstitutional.[13]

Thompson also had two other acts overturned by the courts as unconstitutional.[13] His plan to include church schools in his school voucher plan was found unconstitutional.[13] Thompson also insisted on keeping Good Friday as a half-holiday for state workers, "despite a clear ruling" from the Seventh Circuit, earning a rebuke from the court.[13]
Tobacco[edit]
As governor, Thompson was friendly to tobacco interests.[18] His campaign accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and trips from Philip Morris.[18] He also vetoed a tobacco excise tax and "delayed authorizing the state attorney general to join other state[s] in a lawsuit against cigarette manufacturers.[18]
Abortion[edit]
Thompson is Catholic and opposes abortion. His support for legislation in Wisconsin restricting abortions led Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-choice groups to oppose his nomination to head HHS.[18]
Treatment of Ojibwa spearfishers[edit]
In 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued its "Voigt Decision", which found that Wisconsin's Ojibwa tribe had a treaty-guaranteed right to engage in traditional spearfishing off-reservation and that the state of Wisconsin was prohibited from regulating fishing on Ojibwa land.[44] The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1983.[44][45]
During his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, Thompson suggested abrogating the Ojibwa's rights.[44] Once in office, Thompson called on two Ojibwa tribes to sell their treaty-guaranteed rights: the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $42 million, and the Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, for $10 million.[44] Thompson's administration tried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the "Voigt Decision".[44] The State of Wisconsin argued that Native Americans' lives were in danger from protesters if they continued spearfishing.[44]
In 1989, federal judge Barbara Crabb ruled against the Thompson Administration's legal efforts. The judge rebuked the state for attempting to avoid violence by punishing the Ojibwa, since it was violence by non-Native American protesters that was the threatened danger.[45] Crabb issued an injunction against violent anti-spearfishing protests in 1991, and made it permanent in 1992.[46] On May 20, 1991, the Thompson administration declared it would no longer attempt to appeal the 1983 Voight Decision.[44]
Other leadership roles[edit]
During his time as governor, Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association and the Education Commission of the States,[13] in addition to the Council of State Governments, the Republican Governors Association, the Council of Great Lakes Governors, and the Midwestern Governors Association.
Vice presidential discussion[edit]
Thompson's name had been in the press as a possible vice presidential pick during several election seasons. By 1992, Thompson himself had openly discussed his desire to be the Republican vice presidential nominee for 1996.[13]
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole considered Thompson as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1996 and Thompson openly lobbied for the position.[13] However, Thompson was forced to fight off perceptions of being someone to "bluster through a speech, turn bombastic during public statements", and have difficulty thinking on his feet. During the 1996 vetting process, Dole also reportedly remarked on Thompson's lack of finesse in their interactions.[13]
After Dole disclosed that Thompson was no longer under consideration, Thompson stated that he was relieved because he had been "scared to death" of the process and the spotlight of the position.[47]
Health and Human Services Secretary[edit]




Thompson at the 2004 HealthierUS summit


Thompson left the governorship when he was appointed by President George W. Bush as HHS Secretary. He was confirmed by the Senate on January 24, 2001 Thompson announced his resignation from HHS on December 3, 2004,[48] and served until January 26, 2005, when the Senate confirmed his successor, Michael O. Leavitt.
While Secretary, he launched initiatives to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health,[48] reorganize the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency, and clear the backlog of waivers and state plan amendments. He approved 1,400 state plans and waiver requests and thereby provide health insurance to 1.8 million lower-income Americans.[49] In the aftermath of 9–11 he also worked on strengthening the nation's preparedness for a bio-terrorism attack, by stockpiling smallpox vaccines and investing heavily in state and local public health infrastructure.[50]
Key initiatives[edit]
Thompson's major initiatives were "efforts to strengthen U.S. preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, expand health insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, and focus attention on health problems such as obesity and diabetes."[51]
Medicare prescription drug-benefit[edit]
Thompson was one of the key architects of the 2003 passage of Bush's Medicare Modernization Act, which was slated to provide public funding for prescription drugs for Medicare recipients starting in 2006. On the prescription drug-benefit issue, the major piece of health care legislation of President Bush's first term, Thompson frequently served as the president's point man. National analysts cite the passage of Medicare reform as the most important achievement of Thompson's tenure as HHS secretary.[52]
As part of the debate over the adoption of Medicare Part D, Thompson was involved in a dispute over whether the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had to share cost estimates to Congress for legislation that would create a prescription drug benefit. Critics accused Thompson and HHS of downplaying the true cost of the law by $150 billion. CMS Administrator Tom Scully threatened to fire a CMS actuary if he revealed to Congress his estimate. Investigators determined that the data was improperly hidden from Congress, but did not conclude whether laws had been broken.[53] In 2011 the trustees of Medicare found that the prescription drug benefit had come in 40% below estimates, the Congressional Budget Office (using different budgeting numbers) determined that the program had come in 28% below projections.[54]
2001 anthrax scare[edit]
Early in his term, Thompson faced an emergency situation with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Thompson was given poor marks for seeming "utterly overtaken by events" and issuing "early statements that the government was prepared to deal with any biological emergency [that] never squared with the facts."[55]
At a White House briefing following the first anthrax death of the scare, Thompson made a statement to the press that "would be cited for years afterward as a historic blunder in crisis communication."[56] Thompson offered the media a "far-fetched" suggestion that the individual who died had come into contact with anthrax from drinking water from a creek.[57] Thompson's words were criticized by a range of experts as unwarranted, potentially undermining public confidence, and as the "kind of statements that lead to mistrust of officials and experts."[58][59] Thompson was also faulted for positioning himself as the voice of the Administration to the public on this issue, having had no formal training in medicine or public health.[56]
Politicizing of science[edit]
In 2001, early in his term as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson's office rejected 19 of 26 people, including a Nobel laureate, recommended for seats on the advisory board for the NIH developing nations unit by the unit's director.[60] In return, Thompson's office sent back to the unit's director, Gerald Keusch of the Fogarty International Center, résumés for other scientists that Keusch described as "lightweights" with "no scientific credibility." Keusch relayed to one of those rejected, Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, that he was pushed aside for having "signed too many full-page letters in The New York Times critical of President Bush."[61] This incident was cited by the advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists as part of a report detailing their allegations of a "politicization of science" under President George W. Bush's administration.[62][63]
Resignation press conference[edit]
Thompson resigned on December 3, 2004, in a press conference at which he issued warnings over the dangers of avian flu and the poisoning of U.S. food supplies by terrorists.[51] Thompson stated that he had attempted to resign in 2003, but remained until after the President's reelection at the administration's request.[64][65][66] Some noted, in particular, his words: "I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do. And we are importing a lot of food from the Middle East, and it would be easy to tamper with that."[51]
Post-government career[edit]
After leaving the public sector at the end of the Bush Administration, Thompson joined the law firm Akin Gump, and the consulting firm Deloitte and joined the boards of directors of other companies.[1][67]
Thompson also joined the board of about two dozen private companies and nonprofit groups.[68]
In 2011, Thompson was paid more than $1.1 million in cash and stock incentives from five public companies, Thompson's consulting firm was paid $471,000 by six companies, and Thompson himself received $3 million from the sale of a healthcare firm he chaired. Thompson's work with these companies and other investments led him to accumulate a disclosed net worth of $13 million.[68]
A number of those companies and organizations "he helps oversee have faced an array of troubles, including claims of making faulty and dangerous medical implants, failing grades from a corporate watchdog and allegations of misleading investors." An expert with one agency that gave failing marks three of the six public companies who boards Thompson sits on commented that "either [Thompson] has really bad luck choosing companies...or he is one of the directors on company boards who is not exercising sufficient oversight."[68]
Health care consulting and Law Firm[edit]
Thompson became a partner at law firm Akin Gump, a Washington, D.C., law firm that engages in federal lobbying.[1] There, Thompson provided "strategic advice" to the lobbyists in the firm's health care practice, advising them on how to most successfully lobby government officials on behalf of the firm's clients.[1]
He also became a senior advisor at the professional services firm Deloitte and became Chairman of its Deloitte Center for Health Care Management and Transformation.[67][69] Thompson was no longer associated with Deloitte by October 2011.[67]
For the United States presidential election in 2016 Thompson endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[70]
ADS board membership[edit]
Shortly after leaving his Bush Cabinet post, Thompson joined and served for two years on the board of directors of Applied Digital Solutions, makers of the controversial VeriChip: a glass-encapsulated RFID chip that can be injected into human flesh for various database-driven identification purposes.[71] The FDA issued approval to the device while its parent agency, DHHS, was headed by Thompson, who became a board member of ADS within five months. He received shares of stock in ADS, and compensation, leading the non-profit advocacy group Project on Government Oversight to characterize Thompson's actions "unacceptable" and embarrassing, although unfortunately entirely legal.[71]
Medicare[edit]
After leaving office, Thompson began offering policy solutions for a variety of programs that he had overseen as HHS Secretary.[72] However, critics claimed many changes would benefit companies Thompson owned or had a financial stake in (including Centene and the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions).[72] These included transferring some Medicaid beneficiaries from federal to state responsibility and requiring digitization of medical records, which would directly benefit those companies.[72]
Public interest activities[edit]
Thompson spoke as a panelist at a 2005 Kennedy School of Government conference on global poverty, where he discussed medical diplomacy.[73] Thompson also authored a Boston Globe op-ed on the topic.[74]
One of the nonprofit organizations that Thompson joined the board of, Medical Missions for Children, recruited Thompson to co-host a number of episodes of one of its health instructional series, Plain Talk about Health.[75]
2008 Presidential campaign[edit]
Main article: Tommy Thompson presidential campaign, 2008
After first announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late 2006, Thompson announced his candidacy for the 2008 presidential election on April 1, 2007.[76]
Statement about sexual orientation and workplace protections[edit]
During a May 3, 2007, presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Thompson was asked by moderator Chris Matthews whether a private employer opposed to homosexuality should have the right to fire a gay worker.[77] He said, "I think that is left up to the individual business. I really sincerely believe that that is an issue that business people have got to make their own determination as to whether or not they should be." He called CNN the following morning to say he did not hear the question correctly. He apologized, saying, "It's not my position. There should be no discrimination in the workplace."
Political contributions[edit]
Thompson made campaign contributions to two Democrats in 2008[78] – $250 to Michigan Senator Carl Levin and $100 to Bev Perdue, who was running for Governor of North Carolina. Both Democrats won in that year's elections. All told, Thompson contributed $11,350 to Republican candidates for federal office in the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles, while contributing another $4,900 to Wisconsin Republicans during those same cycles.
Gaffe about Jews, Israel[edit]


“
I'm in the private sector and for the first time in my life I'm earning money. You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that. [...]
I just want to clarify something because I didn't in any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that.
”


— Tommy Thompson, address to the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism – Consultation on Conscience, Washington, DC, April 16, 2007




“
Thompson was courting public support, not trying to alienate people—which means he somehow believed that repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners! There could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes have become.
”


— Abraham Foxman, National Director, Anti-Defamation League, Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype (Macmillan, 2010, p. 139)


In April 2007, Thompson was compelled to apologize for remarks he made about Jews and Israel during an address to an assembled crowd of Jewish social activists in Washington, D.C.[79]
On April 16, 2007, appearing before a conference organized by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Thompson referenced his lucrative transition from public service to the private sector[80][81] and invoked old, slanderous stereotypes linking Judaism with finance.[82] Thompson stated: "You know that's sort of part of the Jewish tradition and I do not find anything wrong with that."[81] Thompson then returned to the podium with the intention of clearing up his earlier comments,[83] adding: "I just want to clarify something because I didn't (by) any means want to infer or imply anything about Jews and finances and things. What I was referring to, ladies and gentlemen, is the accomplishments of the Jewish religion. You've been outstanding business people and I compliment you for that."[81] Thompson's comments caused "unease in the room" as the attendees tried to decode the meaning of Thompson's use of this stereotype.[80][82]
Thompson made a variety of other lesser gaffes, including referring to the Anti Defamation League as the fringe Jewish Defense League, and to Israel bonds as "Jewish bonds".[80][84][85] He discussed his connections to politically conservative Israeli and Jewish leaders while speaking to the mostly liberal leaning group[80][84]
Conference organizers noted the unease with Thompson's words but otherwise limited their comments on the faux pas, instead thanking Thompson for being one of the speakers at the conference.[86]
The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, later wrote of the incident that "there could be no more vivid illustration of how deeply ingrained these stereotypes [about Jews and finances] have become" than Thompson's belief that "repeating an age-old stereotype about Jews and money would please his Jewish listeners!"[82]
After the event, Thompson told Politico that his remarks could be blamed on fatigue and a persistent cold.[79] Journalists believed that Thompson had instead failed to prepare for the event, acquaint himself beforehand with the likely audience, and recruit an adviser to properly brief him before the event.[80][84]
Iowa Straw Poll[edit]
Thompson had stated he would drop out of the race if he did not finish either first or second in the Ames straw poll on August 11, 2007. Thompson finished sixth, with just 7% of the vote, despite the fact that some major contenders were not competing in the poll. On August 12, Thompson officially announced he would drop out of the race.[citation needed]
Endorses Giuliani[edit]
In October 2007, Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani. Thompson told the Associated Press in a statement that "Rudy Giuliani has shown that he is a true leader. He can and will win the nomination and the presidency. He is America's mayor, and during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership." He then endorsed Senator John McCain after Giuliani's withdrawal from the presidential race.[87] In a New York Times article published October 11, 2008, Thompson was quoted in response to a question regarding whether he was happy with McCain's campaign as saying, "No. I don't know who is."[88]
2012 U.S. Senate election[edit]
Main article: United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2012
On September 19, 2011; Thompson announced he would run for the seat vacated by Sen. Herb Kohl,[89] formally announcing on December 1, 2011. He won the Republican nomination on August 14, 2012 after a bitter four-way primary battle against a field which included millionaire hedge fund manager Eric Hovde, former Congressman Mark Neumann and Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald.[90]
The attacks on Thompson led to his defense and endorsement by former Arkansas governor, presidential candidate, and conservative media figure Mike Huckabee.[91]
ALEC member the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $650,000 in support of Thompson's bid for US Senate in the autumn of 2012. Thompson faced Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin in the general election. Although most polls from the spring through September showed Thompson ahead, he ultimately lost to Baldwin in the general election, taking 45.9 percent to Baldwin's 51.5 percent. Ultimately, Thompson could not overcome a combined 260,000-vote deficit in the state's two largest counties, Milwaukee and Dane – home to Milwaukee and Madison, respectively. It was the first time Thompson had lost a statewide election.[citation needed]
Political positions[edit]
During the 2012 campaign, Thompson, speaking to a Tea Party group, said, "who better than me, that’s already finished one of the entitlement programs, to come up with programs that do away with Medicaid and Medicare?"[92] When a videotape of his remarks surfaced, Thompson stated that he did not want to eliminate Medicare, but instead wanted a system that would provide a subsidy to individuals to help them purchase private health insurance.[92]
Thompson favors making the Bush tax cuts permanent and adopting a 15 percent flat tax.[93]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
