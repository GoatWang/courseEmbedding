RisksSummary ProspectusSAISales Charge Schedule



The BP Capital TwinLine MLP Fund (“Fund”) is “C” corporation registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end management investment company, commonly known as a mutual fund. The Fund seeks capital appreciation through distribution growth along with current income, primarily by investing in energy infrastructure master limited partnerships. The Fund may invest in companies of any size and in initial public offerings. Up to 20% of the Fund’s assets may be invested in debt securities rated below investment-grade, commonly known as high-yield securities or junk bonds. The Fund also may also invest in derivatives (futures, options, swaps, forward contracts).
As with any mutual fund, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The Fund is new, with a limited operating history upon which to rely in determining whether to invest. The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in a small number of issuers, potentially exposing it to greater loss than a more diversified portfolio.
The Fund is treated as a regular corporation, or “C” corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Accordingly, unlike traditional open-end mutual funds, the Fund is subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at the graduated rates applicable to corporations (currently a maximum rate of 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The Fund will not benefit from current favorable federal income tax rates on long-term capital gains, and Fund income and losses will not be passed on to shareholders.
Energy-related companies are subject to specific risks, including, among others, fluctuations in commodity prices and consumer demand, substantial government regulation, and depletion of reserves. Small-cap stocks and initial public offerings may be more volatile and less liquid than securities issued by large companies and seasoned issuers. High-yield bonds involve greater risks of default, downgrade, or price declines and are more volatile and tend to be less liquid than investment-grade securities. Derivatives can increase the Fund’s volatility because they can be highly illiquid, difficult to unwind or value, and subject to risk of counter-party default.
Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”) are publicly traded partnerships listed on a national securities exchange. The prices of MLP units may fluctuate abruptly and trading volume may be low, making it difficult for the Fund to sell its units at a favorable price. MLP general partners have the power to take actions that adversely affect the interests of unit holders. Most MLPs do not pay U.S. federal income tax at the partnership level, but an adverse change in tax laws could result in MLPs being treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes, which could reduce or eliminate distributions paid by MLPs to the Fund. The Fund also may invest in MLPs that are taxed as “C” corporations.
 
				 Before you invest, you may want to review the Fund’s prospectus, which contains more information about the Fund and its risks. You can find the Fund’s Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information and other information about the Fund on this website. You may also obtain this information at no cost by calling 1-855-40-BPCAP (1-855-402-7227) or by e-mail at info@bpcfunds.com. The Fund’s Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information, both dated December 31, 2013, are incorporated by reference into this Summary Prospectus.Download TwinLine MLP Fund Summary Prospectus

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

FACTSPERFORMANCELITERATUREFACTS


Fund Overview
Investment Objective
Highland Energy MLP Fund aims to provide investors with current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in large and mid-cap Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) of domestic midstream energy companies.
Combining the Tax Benefits of MLPs with a Mutual Fund Strategy

Diversification 

Provides access to a portfolio of MLPs and a wide variety of energy industry subsectors and regional areas

Potential Tax and Estate Planning Benefits

Typically all quarterly distributions are considered return of capital
Investors receive a 1099 form rather than individual K-1 forms for each underlying investment
Potential for greater suitability for IRAs/401k’s due to lack of UBTI (unrelated business taxable income), unlike the circumstance when the underlying securities are directly owned

Experienced Management

Supported by a team of energy specialists
Highland has extensive expertise in energy-related investing

Growth, Quality, and Daily Liquidity

Focused on midstream MLPs that are historically not as susceptible to distribution fluctuations as those from variable-pay MLPs
Exposure to North American energy infrastructure expansion

Limited Fund Expenses

Fee cap is set at 1.1%

The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Highland Funds carefully before investing. A prospectus with this and other information about Highland's mutual funds can be found on the Literature tab above. You may also obtain a prospectus for our mutual funds by calling 877-665-1287. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
1.The Advisor has contractually agreed to limit the total annual operating expenses of the Fund to 1.10% of average daily net assets attributable to any class of the Fund. The Expense Cap will continue through at least January 31, 2018. Total net operating expenses for each class after expense reimbursement and excluding deferred income tax expenses are Class A 8.40%, Class C 9.15% and Class Y 8.15%.
The Fund accrues deferred income tax liability for its future tax liability associated with the capital appreciation of its investments, the distributions received by the Fund on equity securities of master limited partnerships ("MLPs") considered to be return of capital and for any net operating gains. The Fund’s accrued deferred tax liability, if any, is reflected each day in the Fund’s net asset value per share. The Fund’s deferred tax liability, if any, depends upon the Fund’s net investment gains and losses and realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments and may vary greatly from year to year depending on the nature of the Fund’s investments, the performance of those investments and general market conditions. Therefore, any estimate of deferred tax liability cannot be reliably predicted from year to year. See "Net Asset Value" in the Fund’s prospectus. Total annual Fund operating expenses/(benefit) including deferred taxes (after expense reimbursement) were (8.23)%, (7.48)%, (7.98)% and (8.48)% for Class A, Class C, Class R and Class Y shares, respectively.
*The maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.75%.
Industry Concentration Risk. Because the Fund normally invests at least 80% of the value of its assets in energy and materials companies, the Fund’s performance largely depends on the overall condition of these industries and the Fund is susceptible to economic, political and regulatory risks or other occurrences associated with these industries.
Equity Securities Risk. Equity securities, such as common stocks, are subject to market, economic and business risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate.
Short Sales Risk.Short sales that are not made “against-the-box” (as defined under “Description of Principal Investments”) theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase.
Derivatives Risk.Derivatives are subject to the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Derivatives also expose the Fund to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty.
Leverage Risk. Leverage may increase the risk of loss, cause fluctuations in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the NAV of the Fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise.
Debt Securities Risk.The Fund’s ability to invest in high-yield debt securities generally subjects the Fund to greater risk than securities with higher ratings. Such securities are regarded by the rating organizations as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation.
Senior Loans Risks.  Investments in senior loans involves risks similar to the risks of high yield debt securities, although senior loans are typically senior and secured in contrast to below investment grade securities
ETF Risk.The price movement of an ETF may not track the underlying index and may result in a loss. In addition, shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the Fund’s expenses and similar expenses of the underlying investment company when the Fund invests in shares of another investment company.
Non-U.S. Securities Risk. Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments (for example, expropriation or political or economic instability).
Hedging Risk. Although intended to limit or reduce investment risk, hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit. There is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful.
Market Risk.The Fund’s share price will fluctuate with changes in the market value of its portfolio securities.  Many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the Fund.
Portfolio Turnover Risk.High portfolio turnover will increase the Fund’s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains.
Securities Lending Risk. The Fund may lend its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial institutions.  The risk in lending portfolio securities, as with other extensions of credit, consists of possible loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower fail financially.
Illiquid and Restricted Securities Risk. The Adviser may not be able to sell illiquid or restricted securities at the price it would like or may have to sell them at a loss.
Non-Diversification Risk.As a non-diversified fund, the Fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in the securities of one or a few issuers than a diversified fund. A non-diversified fund’s investment in fewer issuers may result in the fund’s shares being more sensitive to the economic results of those issuers. An investment in the Fund could fluctuate in value more than an investment in a diversified fund.
Management Risk.The Fund relies on Highland’s ability to achieve its investment objective. Highland may be incorrect in its assessment of the intrinsic value of companies whose securities the Fund holds, which may result in a decline in the value of Fund shares.
Risks Related to Current Market Conditions. Recently, domestic and international markets have experienced a period of acute stress starting in the real estate and financial sectors and then moving to other sectors of the world economy. This stress has resulted in unusual and extreme volatility in the equity markets and in the prices of individual stocks.  These market conditions could add to the risk of short-term volatility of the Fund.
