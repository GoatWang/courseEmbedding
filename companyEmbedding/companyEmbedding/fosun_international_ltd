            Fosun | Investor Relations | Corporate OverviewCorporate OverviewFosun was founded in 1992 in Shanghai. Fosun International (00656.HK) was listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on July 16, 2007.
Over the last two decades, Fosun has evolved from an entrepreneurial start-up into a leading investment group taking roots in China with a global foothold. Fosun has been actively implementing its investment model of “Combining China’s Growth Momentum with Global Resources” and adhering to its “value-investing” discipline, aspiring to becoming a world-class investment group underpinned by the twin drivers of “insurance-oriented integrated financial capability” and “global industrial integration capability taking roots in China”.
Along with the “insurance + investment” twin-driver core strategy, Fosun’s ultimate vision is to provide clients with one-stop solution integrating wealth, health and happiness. By leveraging new technologies including internet, Fosun is devoted to launching competitive products and services that astonish clients. Today, Fosun’s businesses include two major segments, integrated finance (wealth) (including insurance, investment, wealth management, internet finance) and industrial operations (including health, happiness, steel, property development & sales, resources).
In practice, Fosun unremittingly builds up its core competencies in “identifying and capturing investment opportunities in China”, “improving the management and enhancing value of the investees”, and “establishing a multi-channel financing system to access quality capital”. Meanwhile, Fosun also started its global partnership program and is evolving into an elite organization with every Fosuner maintaining an entrepreneurial spirit and upholding its cultural values of “Self-improvement, Teamwork, Development and Contribution to Society”. With a value chain based on the above-mentioned core competencies and a group of entrepreneurs endorsing Fosun’s corporate culture, a solid foundation has been laid for the continuous rapid growth of Fosun.

Bidding War Looms For Gemfields Group
Jun 14 17
A potential bidding war could be in sight for Gemfields Plc (AIM:GEM), after Shanghai-based conglomerate Fosun International Limited (SEHK:656) approached the ruby and emerald miner a month after it pushed back against an offer from its largest shareholder. Gemfields said it had been in talks with Fosun, which owns the Club Med holiday chain and is run by billionaire Guo Guangchang, over a potential competing offer. Gemfields urged its shareholders to wait for a further update on the talks. Last month, Gemfields labelled an unsolicited offer from its largest shareholder Pallinghurst Resources Limited (JSE:PGL) as "derisory" and said it "clearly undervalues" the group. At the time, Pallinghurst said it had taken action and made the offer for Gemfields due to its lacklustre share
price and returns.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.

Fosun International is a publicly traded arm of Fosun Group, a private investment firm in Shanghai that was founded by four students of Fudan University in 1992, then listed in Hong Kong in 2007. Chairman Guo Guangchang majored in philosophy at Fudan University before becoming an investor. His hobby is tai chi.
