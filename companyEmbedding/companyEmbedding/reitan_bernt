Bernt Reitan (Photo: Business Wire)






Business Wire




Feb 23, 2010 4:00 PM EST













 


















































  “In his roles at Alcoa and his previous position as President and CEO of Elkem of Norway, John has proven himself to be an outstanding leader with deep knowledge of the primary aluminum business, and he has a successful track record of motivating people and achieving results under the most challenging circumstances,” said Alcoa President and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld.   Commenting on the retirement of Mr. Reitan, Mr. Kleinfeld said, “For almost 40 years, Bernt has dedicated himself to the aluminum business and has made huge contributions to the improvement of the industry. He has been a tremendous asset to Alcoa not only in the work that he has done within the company but also through the boards and industry associations with which he has partnered. I’m pleased that Bernt will assume the position of Chairman’s Counsel on March 1 until his retirement on August 1, so we can continue to benefit from his insights and experience.”  Mr. Reitan joined Alcoa in 2000 as general manager of Alcoa World Alumina Chemicals Europe, and six months later he was named president of Alcoa World Chemicals. He was elected an Alcoa vice president in 2001, when he assumed global accountability for Alcoa’s alumina business as president, Alcoa World Alumina Chemical s (AWAC). In January 2003, he was appointed President, Alcoa Primary Metals and by the end of 2003 was named Executive Vice President and Group President for Global Primary Products.  During his tenure, Mr. Reitan helped to expand the company into new, cost-effective geographies, including Alcoa Fjarðaál in Iceland, the company’s first new greenfield smelter in 20 years, and the Alcoa Juruti bauxite mine and port in Brazil. He also oversaw the expansion and modernization of Alcoa refineries and smelters around the world. Under his direction, Alcoa implemented an agreement with Orkla, exchanging their stakes in a Norwegian smelting partnership with the Swedish extrusion joint venture to focus on areas of expertise and best practices. Mr. Reitan also played a significant role in the repowering of Alcoa, creating Alcoa’s Energy group and building security for the company’s smelting operations through long-term power contracts.
