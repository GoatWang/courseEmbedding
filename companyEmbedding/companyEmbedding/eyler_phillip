 Educational Background



 


Purdue University

                  Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly, taking advantage of the Morrill Act, accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.

The university was founded with the gift of $150,000 from John Purdue, a Lafayette business leader and philanthropist, along with $50,000 from Tippecanoe County, and 150 acres (0.6 km²) of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project. In 1869, it was decided that the new school would be built near the city of Lafayette and established as Purdue University, in the name of the institution’s principal benefactor.

The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 master’s and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 850 student organizations. Today, Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States.                




 


Duke University - The Fuqua School of Business

                  The Fuqua School of Business (pronounced /'fju?kw?/) is the business school of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, United States. It currently enrolls 1,340 students in degree-seeking programs. These programs include the Daytime Master of Business Administration (MBA), the Global Executive MBA, the Cross Continent MBA, the Weekend Executive MBA, Master of Management Studies: Foundations of Business, Master of Management in Clinical Informatics (MMCi), Master of Management Studies (in partnership with the Seoul National University), joint degree programs (including joint degrees in medicine, law, environmental management, forestry, public policy, and nursing), a one-year Master of Management Studies program in Kunshan, China (starting) 2012 and a Ph.D. program. Additionally, Duke Executive Education and Duke Corporate Education offer non-degree business education and professional development programs.

18 year HARMAN Automotive Veteran Brings Extensive Engineering and Leadership Experience
Phillip Eyler
HARMAN International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE:HAR), the premier audio, infotainment and software services company, today named Phillip Eyler as Executive Vice President and President, Infotainment, effective immediately.  Eyler was previously Senior Vice President & General Manager, Global Automotive Audio. He joins the HARMAN Executive Committee and reports to Dinesh C. Paliwal, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HARMAN.
“Phil is a proven automotive leader with an impressive track record of results. After conducting an extensive search internally and externally, Phil’s experience, deep relationships with all major automakers globally and discipline for flawless execution make him ideally suited for this role,” said Paliwal. “Phil understands customer needs for tightly integrated connected car solutions and has a demonstrated history of producing industry-leading innovations. Phil will expedite the introduction of technologies that will accelerate next-gen connected driving, a pursuit HARMAN is well positioned to lead.”
In his new role, Eyler will lead the nearly $3 billion Infotainment division of HARMAN which develops integrated systems encompassing Augmented Navigation, Telematics, Multimedia, Connected Safety  and Cyber Security solutions. He will oversee an organization of 7,500 employees, including top technology experts and engineers throughout the world. He will be based at the Company’s North America Automotive headquarters in Novi, Michigan.

As Senior Vice President & General Manager, Global Automotive Audio, Eyler led sales, marketing, R&D, product engineering, and operations, while spearheading industry-first software platforms like Halosonic, Clari-Fi and Individual Sound Zones. Under his leadership during the last four years, HARMAN grew its automotive audio revenue from $650 million to approximately $1 billion, improved profitability, and more than doubled the order backlog. Prior to his current role, Eyler was responsible for North America Automotive including responsibility for Audio and Infotainment. During that time, Phil successfully led the product development and launch of the industry’s first scalable infotainment platform, contributing to HARMAN’s industry-leading infotainment backlog.
