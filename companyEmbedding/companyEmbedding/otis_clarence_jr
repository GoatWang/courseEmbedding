Early life[edit]
Otis was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi on April 11, 1956 to Clarence Otis, a janitor and Calanthus Hall Otis, a homemaker. He moved with his family to Los Angeles where he grew up in Watts, at the height of the civil unrest of the 1960s.[2]
Education[edit]
He gained a scholarship into Williams College in Massachusetts, where he majored in Economics and Political Science. He graduated magna cum laude in 1977, receiving the school's Political Science writing prize and Phi Beta Kappa recognition in his senior year. Otis then moved on to Stanford University Law School in California, earning his Law degree in 1980.
Career[edit]
He worked in the field of corporate law, specializing in the fields of securities law and mergers and acquisitions. He started out with the firm Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine and moved on to Gordon, Hurwitz, Butowsky, Weitzen, Shalov & Wein. From the start he ran with a high-flying crowd; one of his clients was famed financier Carl Icahn. But, he later on remarked, "I thought the finance side was more exciting than the law, so I moved to an investment banking firm"—Kidder, Peabody & Co. The barely 30-year-old Otis became a vice president at First Boston Corporation in 1987. In this job he got his first exposure to Florida's booming economy as he worked on real estate deals there. He became interested in public and government finance, serving as managing director of Giebert Municipal Capital in 1990 and 1991, and as a vice president and later managing director in Chemical Bank's securities arm between 1991 and 1995. He played a key part in turning around the bank's struggling public finance division, shepherding funding of $2.6 billion for tax-exempt pollution-control projects and participating a $208 million New York City bond issue that was named deal of the year by Institutional Investor magazine.
In 1995, Otis was recruited by Darden Restaurants in Orlando for the post of treasurer, overseeing finance activities for the 1,200-restaurant chain. He correctly assessed Darden as a company on the rise as its "casual dining" market niche—high-volume sit-down restaurants a step above fast food in terms of quality—was growing rapidly. His biggest motivator, however, seemed once again to be the opportunity to acquire a new skill set. Otis came to the company in the final stages of its spin-off from food giant General Mills.
Indeed, while Otis supervised a staff of six, his decisions had company wide ramifications as Darden acquired new sites and financed new buildings all over the country; the chain owns its restaurants rather than franchising them to independent entrepreneurs. He ascended the corporate ladder at Darden, becoming senior vice president of finance in 1997 and chief financial officer in 1999. As the chain shuttered its struggling China Coast restaurants and opened new ventures such as the casual sports-bar barbecue Smokey Bones and the Caribbean-themed Bahama Breeze, Otis impressed his bosses at Darden with his ability to master and apply new skills.
As longtime Darden CEO Joe L. Lee, who opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Florida in 1967, approached retirement, Otis was widely regarded as a protégé of Lee, and after one of his top rivals left for a top position with Burger King, his way was clear. Otis was named Lee's successor as CEO in 2004.
Compensation[edit]
While CEO of Darden Restaurants in 2010, Otis earned a total compensation of $7,656,703, which included a base salary of $946,800, a cash bonus of $1,673,900, stocks granted of $1,783,697, options granted of $2,879,930, and other compensation totaling $372,376.[3]
Politics[edit]
According to Matthew Yglesias, Otis "seems to be a Democrat" and has donated to Democratic Congressman Ron Klein of Florida.[4]
Personal life[edit]
Otis and his wife Jacqueline Bradley (b. 1958) were married in 1983 and have raised three children. His son, Calvin (b. 1989), graduated from Columbia University in Spring 2011, where he was a member of the football team.

Otis then moved on to Stanford University Law School in California, earning his Law degree in 1980.

He worked in the field of corporate law, specializing in the fields of securities law and mergers and acquisitions.

Lee, who opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Florida in 1967, approached retirement, Otis was widely regarded as a protégé of Lee, and after one of his top rivals left for a top position with Burger King, his way was clear. Otis was named Lee's successor as CEO in 2004.
Compensation[edit]
While CEO of Darden Restaurants in 2010, Otis earned a total compensation of $7,656,703, which included a base salary of $946,800, a cash bonus of $1,673,900, stocks granted of $1,783,697, options granted of $2,879,930, and other compensation totaling $372,376.[3]
Politics[edit]
According to Matthew Yglesias, Otis "seems to be a Democrat" and has donated to Democratic Congressman Ron Klein of Florida.[4]
Personal life[edit]
Otis and his wife Jacqueline Bradley (b. 1958) were married in 1983 and have raised three children. His son, Calvin (b. 1989), graduated from Columbia University in Spring 2011, where he was a member of the football team.

Clarence Otis, Jr. (born April 11, 1956 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, United States) is an American businessman and former CEO of Darden Restaurants. Otis was named the 11th most powerful person in Central Florida by the Orlando Sentinel in 2010.[1]

Early life[edit]
Otis was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi on April 11, 1956 to Clarence Otis, a janitor and Calanthus Hall Otis, a homemaker. He moved with his family to Los Angeles where he grew up in Watts, at the height of the civil unrest of the 1960s.[2]
Education[edit]
He gained a scholarship into Williams College in Massachusetts, where he majored in Economics and Political Science. He graduated magna cum laude in 1977, receiving the school's Political Science writing prize and Phi Beta Kappa recognition in his senior year. Otis then moved on to Stanford University Law School in California, earning his Law degree in 1980.
Career[edit]
He worked in the field of corporate law, specializing in the fields of securities law and mergers and acquisitions. He started out with the firm Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine and moved on to Gordon, Hurwitz, Butowsky, Weitzen, Shalov & Wein. From the start he ran with a high-flying crowd; one of his clients was famed financier Carl Icahn. But, he later on remarked, "I thought the finance side was more exciting than the law, so I moved to an investment banking firm"—Kidder, Peabody & Co. The barely 30-year-old Otis became a vice president at First Boston Corporation in 1987. In this job he got his first exposure to Florida's booming economy as he worked on real estate deals there. He became interested in public and government finance, serving as managing director of Giebert Municipal Capital in 1990 and 1991, and as a vice president and later managing director in Chemical Bank's securities arm between 1991 and 1995. He played a key part in turning around the bank's struggling public finance division, shepherding funding of $2.6 billion for tax-exempt pollution-control projects and participating a $208 million New York City bond issue that was named deal of the year by Institutional Investor magazine.
In 1995, Otis was recruited by Darden Restaurants in Orlando for the post of treasurer, overseeing finance activities for the 1,200-restaurant chain. He correctly assessed Darden as a company on the rise as its "casual dining" market niche—high-volume sit-down restaurants a step above fast food in terms of quality—was growing rapidly. His biggest motivator, however, seemed once again to be the opportunity to acquire a new skill set. Otis came to the company in the final stages of its spin-off from food giant General Mills.
Indeed, while Otis supervised a staff of six, his decisions had company wide ramifications as Darden acquired new sites and financed new buildings all over the country; the chain owns its restaurants rather than franchising them to independent entrepreneurs. He ascended the corporate ladder at Darden, becoming senior vice president of finance in 1997 and chief financial officer in 1999. As the chain shuttered its struggling China Coast restaurants and opened new ventures such as the casual sports-bar barbecue Smokey Bones and the Caribbean-themed Bahama Breeze, Otis impressed his bosses at Darden with his ability to master and apply new skills.
As longtime Darden CEO Joe L. Lee, who opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Florida in 1967, approached retirement, Otis was widely regarded as a protégé of Lee, and after one of his top rivals left for a top position with Burger King, his way was clear. Otis was named Lee's successor as CEO in 2004.
Compensation[edit]
While CEO of Darden Restaurants in 2010, Otis earned a total compensation of $7,656,703, which included a base salary of $946,800, a cash bonus of $1,673,900, stocks granted of $1,783,697, options granted of $2,879,930, and other compensation totaling $372,376.[3]
Politics[edit]
According to Matthew Yglesias, Otis "seems to be a Democrat" and has donated to Democratic Congressman Ron Klein of Florida.[4]

Clarence Otis, Jr., Joins Healthy Dining Board of Directors 


By Sara Lucero
October 8, 2015

Clarence Otis, Jr., former chairman and CEO of Darden Restaurants Inc., the world's largest full-service restaurant company, is once again leading change in the restaurant industry.  With a view to the future, Otis is joining the board of directors of Healthy Dining, demonstrating the importance of nutrition in the rapidly changing industry. 

“I am pleased to be joining Healthy Dining’s board of directors, especially at such an exciting time for this innovative company which has great potential to make a real difference for restaurants, their guests and for public health,” Otis said. “With consumer demand for nutritious meals on the rise and the FDA mandating the posting of nutrition information on restaurant menus,” Otis explained, “there is an imperative need for Healthy Dining’s expertise, products and services.”

Otis also serves on the boards of Verizon Communications, Inc.; apparel giant VF Corporation; the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; and Jazz at Lincoln Center.  He is also a member of the National Board of Governors of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the board of trustees of Williams College, the board of trustees of Cleveland Clinic and the board of visitors of Stanford Law School.

“I am thrilled and honored to have Clarence join our board. He is a renowned leader in the restaurant industry – and has an admirable dedication to health and wellness, so he will be of great benefit to our company,” said Anita Jones-Mueller, president and founder of Healthy Dining. “We are in an exciting period of growth as we amplify our traction and help the restaurant industry best meet the nutrition-related needs of their guests through Healthy Dining’s expertise and new programs and technologies.”

Under Otis’s leadership, Darden Restaurants enacted several high-profile nutrition initiatives, including partnering with Healthy Dining and featuring all restaurant brands on HealthyDiningFinder.com; getting ready for menu labeling compliance with nutrient analysis services provided by Healthy Dining; and being the first restaurant company to make a pledge to the First Lady’s Partnership for a Healthier America to reduce their restaurants’ calorie and sodium footprint and to offer healthier children’s meals.

The Healthy Dining board is led by Jones-Mueller and also includes members Alan Gould and Jose Mallabo.  Gould has spent more than 35 years in the foodservice and hospitality industries.  He serves on the boards of the Multi-Cultural Foodservice and Hospitality Alliance and Johnson & Wales University. Most recently, he was the publisher of Nation’s Restaurant News (NRN), the largest foodservice industry publication, and corporate vice president of Lebhar-Friedman, Inc., NRN’s parent company, until he retired in January 2008. Prior to NRN, Gould was head of the corporate public relations for Hilton International.  Mallabo is the co-founder and CEO of startup Vireo Labs and has also held senior level positions at LinkedIn, eBay, GSI Commerce, Tweetalicious and Savannah College of Art & Design.

Corporate CEO Clarence Otis was born April 11, 1956, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. His father, Clarence Otis Sr., worked as a janitor while his mother, Calanthus Hall Otis, stayed home to raise their three children. The family moved to the Watts section of Los Angeles, California, when Otis was four years old. Although Watts was at the time a sprawling ghetto that in 1965 would become the site of the Watts riot, Clarence Otis Sr. drove the family through Beverly Hills to show his children that a different life was possible. Otis credits these drives, as well as a stable family life, for keeping him away from the gang activity prevalent in Watts. 

In high school, Otis was a dedicated student, known to spend hours in the library. His focus paid off, and the ambitious young man earned a scholarship to Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he double-majored in economics and political science. Otis graduated magna cum laude from Williams in 1977 and received the political science award and Phi Beta Kappa honors. He then studied law at Stanford University in California and graduated with a JD in 1980. 

After four years of working as a corporate lawyer, the young attorney found success as a vice president and managing director for several prestigious investment banking firms. In 1995 Darden Restaurants (the parent company of major chain restaurants such as Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse) recruited Otis, then thirty-nine, to be the company’s vice president and treasurer.

Although Otis’s only prior experience in the food industry was a brief stint as a waiter in college, he excelled at Darden. Over the next nine years, he was promoted several times, eventually becoming CEO in 2004. He was Darden’s first African American CEO, and one of only seven African American CEOs of a Fortune 500 company that year.

Undeterred by a tough economy, the new CEO avoided the mass layoffs and extreme price cutting of Darden’s competitors, and his strategy paid off. The corporation saw profits rise and its stock price double. Under Otis’s leadership, Darden acquired several new restaurant chains, and was the first full-service restaurant company to land on Fortune 500’s Best Places to Work list. In 2007 Otis Jr. received a Horatio Alger Award, and in 2012 he was awarded the Silver Plate by the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association.

Otis’s career has not been without controversy. In 2011 Darden’s profits began to fall, and three years later, the company underwent two rounds of layoffs and sold its struggling Red Lobster chain. Otis was blamed for the layoffs and the sale of its subsidiary. Critics now faulted him for his lack of experience in the food industry and for expanding the company too quickly. Otis announced his resignation as CEO of Darden Restaurants in July 2014. 

Clarence Otis Jr. has been married to Jacqueline Bradley since 1983, and the couple has three children. They reside in Florida and are the proud owners of one of the largest privately held African art collections in the United States.

This interview of Clarence Otis Jr., C.E.O. of Darden Restaurants, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. What’s the most important leadership lesson you’ve learned?A. It’s one that I learned early on, and it kept getting reinforced and cemented over time with a number of different leaders. It’s this notion that leaders really think about others first. They think about the people who are on the team, trying to help them get the job done. They think about the people who they’re trying to do a job for. Your thoughts are always there first, and you think about what’s the appropriate response for whatever that audience is, and you think last about “what does this mean for me?”The guy who reinforced that most would have been my predecessor here at Darden, Joe Lee. I was C.F.O. at the time, but on Sept. 11, 2001, after it became clear what had happened, we had an all-employee meeting, and Joe started to talk. One of the first things he said was, “we are trying to understand where all our people are who are traveling.”The second thing he said was: “We’ve got a lot of Muslim teammates, managers in our restaurants, employees in our restaurants, who are going to be under a lot of stress during this period. And so, we need to make sure we’re attentive to that.” And that was pretty powerful. Of all the things you could focus on that morning, he thought about the people who were on the road and then our Muslim colleagues.

Q. How would you say your leadership style has changed over time?A. It’s less and less about getting the work done and more and more about building the team  —  getting the right people in place who have the talent and capability to get the work done and letting them do it.

Q. Anything in your background that, looking back, prepared you for the art of building a team?A. The thing that prepared me the most — where the team was front and center  —  was theater, which I did a lot of growing up,    in high school, during college, law school and even for a couple of years after law school. I would say that probably is the starkest lesson in how reliant you are on others, because you’re there in front of an audience. It’s all live, and everybody’s got to know their lines and know their cues and know their movement, and so you’re totally dependent on people doing that.You could have your piece down, but if one person on the team doesn’t, you’re in trouble, and it’s embarrassing because people aren’t used to seeing errors in theater. Theater is seamless every night.Q. How do you hire people? A. The most important thing to me is, you want to see someone who has passion, who really gets excited about the world around them and has drive. I like people who are energized by what they’re working on. I’m comfortable with people who are passionate, comfortable with people who are ambitious for the organizations they work in, ambitious for the function that they are building a career in, and want to make a contribution.Being comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty is a trait I look for, because those folks are pretty comfortable with diversity, and not knowing how people who have differences might react in a situation doesn’t unmoor them. They’re comfortable with it and may even like that. Those kinds of folks also, when they’re faced with ambiguity and uncertainty, they’ve got their wits about them, so they’re looking as much for the opportunity that’s inherent in that as they are for the risk.Q. How do you find out if somebody is like that?A. You ask them about the various experiences they have had, and you try to probe, “where were those circumstances where there wasn’t good direction, when it wasn’t clear how things would break?” How do they respond to those questions? What’s the narrative around how they thought and behaved in those environments?Q. Are there things that, as a leader or manager, you’ve learned to do less of over time?A. I’d say probably less word-smithing, less massaging of the work product, more thinking, more reflecting. And that’s hard, because I like to wordsmith. With my background in theater and the law, I like that kind of stuff, and I work on things past the point where it makes any difference.Q. What are you word-smithing?A. I’ll wordsmith press releases, wordsmith analyst reports, reports to the board. You can wordsmith internal employee memos and speeches. There are all kinds of things.

Q. Any thoughts on how language is used in the business world?A. I think writing in the business world is more functional than elegant. I felt that way making the transition from law to business. Lawyers write much better. They spend a lot more time on it. In the business world, it’s less about how well you say it and more about how efficiently you say it.

I do think language is important in leadership, and it’s critically important in oral communication. It’s worth thinking about exactly how you’re going to say something. It’s important for focusing people. It’s important for inspiring them. It’s important for directing them. The more senior you are, the more important it is, because your voice is amplified.

I did think it was an interesting debate during the presidential Democratic primary, when they talked about Barack Obama and how being able to give a good speech was one thing, but getting things done was another. I think to get a lot of things done, you have to be able to give a good speech. So I thought that was a specious argument.Q. Are there areas you’re trying to improve as a leader?A. As I said, I really value the passion. As a senior leader, sometimes you’ve got to harness the passion. So, you’ve got to give other people the chance to speak, voice a point of view. Some people are passionate, but it manifests itself in a different way, and so they’re more reflective in conversation. And so, you’ve got to leave some space for them to fill.Q. Do you find, looking back over the course of your career, there was a certain insight you had that put you on a different trajectory?A. I went to Williams College. I went to Stanford Law School. And I loved them both. I was a strong student at Williams, which I needed to be to get into a school like Stanford. I got to Stanford, and it was clear that the level of brain power among my student peers had just stepped up several levels. It was clear to me pretty quickly that no matter how hard I worked, I was not going to do better than a lot of my peers, because things came quicker to them than they did to me. Even though that was not true at Williams, it was true at Stanford. But that was fine, and I was comfortable with that.What I discovered when I started practicing law was that, even though others had more intellectual horsepower, people still listened to me. They cared about what I thought — my peers, and the people I worked for. And so, that was probably the insight that told me at some point I could have a leadership position, because people really seemed to care what I thought, and they listened to me.Q. Was there a particularly good piece of advice somebody gave you about your career?A. One of the guys I worked for very early on said: “As you think about career, it’s not about planning it. Things are too dynamic; there’s too much going on; there are too many things that’ll pop up, good and bad. It’s not about planning and career planning; it’s about preparation and building skills. And if you do that, then you’ll recover from the mishaps, and you’ll be able to take advantage of the opportunities.”Q. What has surprised you the most about the top job?A. I would say it’s how amplified everything that you say or do is. That was the case at every senior job. It’s even more true of this position. And so, you have to be very intentional about what you say and do. If you’re not, then something that was just thinking out loud, some thought you had, some “what if,” becomes a directive, even though 10 seconds later in your own mind you dismissed it.

Q. Let’s talk about time management. How do you do it? A. I schedule and block the calendar to have downtime, because I do think that in senior leadership positions, one of your jobs is to reflect, and you have to schedule time to do that. I try to leave a few hours a week that are unscheduled.Q. What would you like business schools to teach more of, or less of?A. I didn’t go to business school; I went to law school. But my sense is the one thing law school does that business schools could do more of is provide you with social context, the broader context within which business operates. There are business-and-the-law kinds of courses, but sometimes they get pretty transactional.I think it would be interesting for business school students to learn constitutional law and comparative law. I think the dialogue between the business community and the civic community is hampered by that gap. And it’s never been clearer in my mind than now, when you’ve got a constitutional law professor as president. There’s just a disconnect. People don’t get the worldview that he’s coming from. But I don’t think he gets the business side as much as he should, either. There is a framework he’s coming from, and it’s as much a foundation to how this country works as the free enterprise system is. You’ve got to reconcile the two.Q. What’s your version of a two-minute commencement speech?A. I would tell them that they’re privileged, given the status that they have, the fact that they’ve been able to get a higher education. And with privilege comes obligations. I think one of the most important obligations is for them to provide leadership in whatever area they choose to dedicate their life to.Provide leadership — that’s the price of the privilege they’ve been granted. So it’s about more than them. Certainly, there are things they want to accomplish, but they’ve got to make sure that those things have some payoff for others.
