L. Roger Mason, Jr., Ph.D. Joins Noblis as Senior Vice President of National Security and Intelligence
Dr. Mason returns to Noblis after five years of service in the Intelligence Community as the first Assistant Director of National Intelligence for Systems and Resource Analyses
2/4/2014

FALLS CHURCH, VA.—February 5, 2014—Noblis, Inc., a leading provider of science, technology, and strategy services, announced today that Dr. Roger Mason, former Assistant Director of National Intelligence for Systems and Resource Analyses (ADNI/SRA) for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), has joined the Noblis team as Senior Vice President of National Security and Intelligence (NSI).
“We are very excited to welcome Dr. Mason back to Noblis,” said Amr ElSawy, President and Chief Executive Officer, Noblis. “Prior to his ODNI appointment, Dr. Mason served as Vice President of Noblis’ NSI mission area. He returns as Senior Vice President of NSI and will also oversee our subsidiary, Noblis ESI, LLC, an organization dedicated to supporting the Intelligence Community (IC).”
Dr. Mason served as the DNI’s principal for key decisions regarding national intelligence capabilities, mission requirements, resources, and strategic priorities. In recognition of his service, Dr. Mason was awarded the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal—the IC’s highest award.
Prior to government service, Dr. Mason served in a number of senior executive leadership positions in the defense-intelligence field. He is a nationally recognized expert in intelligence capabilities, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) technology, operations research, systems integration, and change leadership. As Senior Vice President of the NSI mission area, he will be responsible for the overall direction of Noblis’ national security missions including intelligence, defense, homeland security, and law enforcement.
“I am genuinely thrilled about rejoining the Noblis team and leading the NSI mission,” said Dr. Mason. “The challenges facing national security and intelligence are unprecedented in scale, complexity, and speed. This requires us to marshal the best of our efforts to do our part for the mission by integrating across Noblis’ capabilities in areas that include biometrics, WMD defense, IT systems engineering, big data analytics, and advanced space-airborne processing.”

L. Roger Mason, Jr., Ph.D.
Senior Vice President, National Security and Intelligence
Dr. Mason serves as senior vice president and corporate officer responsible for the overall direction of Noblis’ national security missions including intelligence, defense, homeland security, and law enforcement. In this role, Dr. Mason is also responsible for overseeing Noblis’ two wholly owned subsidiaries, Noblis ESI, LLC and Noblis NSP, LLC. Both organizations are dedicated to supporting the Intelligence Community (IC). He returns to Noblis after five years of service in the IC as the first Assistant Director of National Intelligence for Systems and Resource Analyses (ADNI/SRA). In this capacity, Dr. Mason served as the DNI’s principal intelligence officer and trusted advisor on all matters dealing with intelligence capabilities, resources, requirements, systems analysis, program evaluation, and cost analysis. He led the establishment of this new capability that combined operations research, decision sciences, and business analytics to aid the DNI and senior intelligence agency leaders in making difficult decisions on complex issues that spanned every aspect of intelligence from overhead space technologies to counterterrorism.  In recognition of his service, Dr. Mason was awarded the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal—the IC’s highest award. In addition, he received medallions of excellence from intelligence agency directors and led SRA to four National Intelligence Meritorious Unit Commendations.
Prior to federal service, Dr. Mason served in a number of senior executive positions in the national security sector including Vice President at Noblis, Director at the Institute for Defense Analyses, and General Manager of the Advanced Systems Group at General Dynamics (formerly Veridian). Earlier in his career, he led a number of advanced programs combining technology development, system integration, and field operations for military and intelligence missions.
Dr. Mason is a nationally recognized expert in intelligence capabilities, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) technology, operations research, systems integration, and change leadership. He has published over 35 papers in peer-reviewed journals and symposia and holds two U.S. patents dealing with advanced materials and collection devices. He is a member of the board of directors for the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA).
Dr. Mason earned his doctorate and master’s degrees in engineering physics (nuclear) from the University of Virginia, a master’s degree in business administration from Northwestern University (Kellogg School), and a bachelor’s degree in physics from The George Washington University.
Additionally, he has been recognized with many professional awards including the Omicron Delta Kappa Leadership Honor Society, Alpha Nu Sigma Honor Society for nuclear science, and the University of Virginia Distinguished Student Award.
Dr. Mason is an active leader in the Boy Scouts of America and has been a part of this organization for over 37 years including attaining the rank of Gold Palm Eagle Scout.
