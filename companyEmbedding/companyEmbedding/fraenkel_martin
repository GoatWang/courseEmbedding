Personal life[edit]
Marty Frankel was born to Leon and Tilly Frankel in 1954; he was Leon's fourth child and Tilly's second. He attended the University of Toledo but never graduated.[1]
Career[edit]
Frankel used astrology to make financial trading decisions. In addition, he usually could not bring himself to actually make trades, causing trouble for him with the brokerage firms he worked for. After being fired by his boss John Schulte in 1986, Frankel set up Winthrop Capital using the phony name of James Spencer. He also set up The Frankel Fund with Douglas Maxwell, but remained reluctant to buy or hold his chosen investments.[1][6]
Frankel moved to Florida in 1987, and attracted Palm Beach investors, but the Frankel Fund lost money on trades, and Frankel was using shareholder accounts for paying expenses, including rent, stock-quote services, and personal spending money for himself, his sister, and his mother.[1] By mid-1988, he was also raiding some investor's accounts to cash out other, worried investors who were pulling out their money.[1][6] He transferred the remaining funds to his personal account and told his remaining investor that the fund had collapsed due to Maxwell's bad trades and embezzlement. Frankel gave the funds to an attorney, but the funds were then turned over to the Securities and Exchange Commission.[1]
Frankel moved back to Toledo and started a new firm, Creative Partners, while the SEC was investigating him, using the name Rothschild International Investments and a Swiss bank account to separate Creative Partners from his own name and ongoing investigation. By this time, his former boss's wife, Sonia Schulte, was divorcing. Sonia Schulte set up a brokerage in direct competition with her husband's and directed her clients to Creative Partners; meanwhile, Frankel set up another company, Donar Corporation, which paid for Sonia Schulte's new house, and paid Sonia's divorce and custody lawyers over $300,000 out of the Swiss bank account.[1]



This section needs expansion with: Creative Partners and insurance company purchases. You can help by adding to it. (November 2010)


After paying a fine and agreeing to be barred from trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1992, Frankel used several aliases, including David Rosse.[2]
In an attempt to use the Roman Catholic Church to discourage questions of legitimacy,[6] Frankel founded the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation in the British Virgin Islands, with a nominal mission of investing in insurance companies in order to fund hospitals.[2] Among people solicited to join the Foundation board was retired CBS Evening News anchorman Walter Cronkite; when he declined to join, his name was used anyway.[2] An official of the Roman Curia, Monsignor Emilio Colagiovanni, agreed to sign a letter falsely stating that the Foundation received funding from the Vatican.[6][7]
Arrest and conviction[edit]

Frankel fled the United States in May 1999.[8] He went by private plane to Rome and then to Hamburg, Germany,[6] where he was arrested on September 4.[1] He was first tried and sentenced in Germany to three years in jail for passport fraud. He was then extradited to the U.S. in 2001.[1]
Colagiovanni was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio on August 30, 2001.[7]
In May 2002, Frankel plead guilty to 24 federal counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, and related racketeering and conspiracy.[1] Fifteen of Frankel's associates, including Colagiovanni and Sonia Schulte, also pleaded guilty to related crimes.[6] By the time Frankel was first sentenced in December 2004, sixteen of his accomplices had been convicted.[8] Frankel told the judge that most of his behavior was to earn enough money to provide for Sonia Schulte (by then Sonia Howe) and her two children; after this, the judge asked "So, you stole $209 million in order to take care of the children?" Frankel then explained that he could not end the scheme without it coming apart, and asked the judge to consider that deterrence should not be a factor in his sentencing because "If somebody is mentally ill, you shouldn't punish them because it won't stop other mentally ill people from doing it."[8] Frankel was sentenced to 200 months (16 years 8 months) in federal prison; a state court in Tennessee also sentenced Frankel to 16 years, which was allowed to run concurrently on the condition that he assist officials in recovering lost assets looted from his Tennessee insurance companies.[1]
Several states put Frankel's insurance companies into receivership when it was discovered the companies' primary assets were investments in Frankel's own shell company; among the states affected were Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia.[2]

Martin R. "Marty" Frankel (born 1954)[1] is an American financial criminal who conducted a series of investment frauds in the late 20th century, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. He was caught in 1999, and in 2004 was sentenced to 200 months in prison based on over $200 million in proven losses to insurance companies he bought then looted; the sentence was reaffirmed in 2006.[3]

Personal life[edit]
Marty Frankel was born to Leon and Tilly Frankel in 1954; he was Leon's fourth child and Tilly's second. He attended the University of Toledo but never graduated.[1]
Career[edit]
Frankel used astrology to make financial trading decisions. In addition, he usually could not bring himself to actually make trades, causing trouble for him with the brokerage firms he worked for. After being fired by his boss John Schulte in 1986, Frankel set up Winthrop Capital using the phony name of James Spencer. He also set up The Frankel Fund with Douglas Maxwell, but remained reluctant to buy or hold his chosen investments.[1][6]
Frankel moved to Florida in 1987, and attracted Palm Beach investors, but the Frankel Fund lost money on trades, and Frankel was using shareholder accounts for paying expenses, including rent, stock-quote services, and personal spending money for himself, his sister, and his mother.[1] By mid-1988, he was also raiding some investor's accounts to cash out other, worried investors who were pulling out their money.[1][6] He transferred the remaining funds to his personal account and told his remaining investor that the fund had collapsed due to Maxwell's bad trades and embezzlement. Frankel gave the funds to an attorney, but the funds were then turned over to the Securities and Exchange Commission.[1]
Frankel moved back to Toledo and started a new firm, Creative Partners, while the SEC was investigating him, using the name Rothschild International Investments and a Swiss bank account to separate Creative Partners from his own name and ongoing investigation. By this time, his former boss's wife, Sonia Schulte, was divorcing. Sonia Schulte set up a brokerage in direct competition with her husband's and directed her clients to Creative Partners; meanwhile, Frankel set up another company, Donar Corporation, which paid for Sonia Schulte's new house, and paid Sonia's divorce and custody lawyers over $300,000 out of the Swiss bank account.[1]

After paying a fine and agreeing to be barred from trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1992, Frankel used several aliases, including David Rosse.[2]
In an attempt to use the Roman Catholic Church to discourage questions of legitimacy,[6] Frankel founded the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation in the British Virgin Islands, with a nominal mission of investing in insurance companies in order to fund hospitals.[2] Among people solicited to join the Foundation board was retired CBS Evening News anchorman Walter Cronkite; when he declined to join, his name was used anyway.[2] An official of the Roman Curia, Monsignor Emilio Colagiovanni, agreed to sign a letter falsely stating that the Foundation received funding from the Vatican.[6][7]
Arrest and conviction[edit]

Frankel fled the United States in May 1999.[8] He went by private plane to Rome and then to Hamburg, Germany,[6] where he was arrested on September 4.[1] He was first tried and sentenced in Germany to three years in jail for passport fraud. He was then extradited to the U.S. in 2001.[1]
Colagiovanni was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio on August 30, 2001.[7]
In May 2002, Frankel plead guilty to 24 federal counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, and related racketeering and conspiracy.[1] Fifteen of Frankel's associates, including Colagiovanni and Sonia Schulte, also pleaded guilty to related crimes.[6] By the time Frankel was first sentenced in December 2004, sixteen of his accomplices had been convicted.[8] Frankel told the judge that most of his behavior was to earn enough money to provide for Sonia Schulte (by then Sonia Howe) and her two children; after this, the judge asked "So, you stole $209 million in order to take care of the children?" Frankel then explained that he could not end the scheme without it coming apart, and asked the judge to consider that deterrence should not be a factor in his sentencing because "If somebody is mentally ill, you shouldn't punish them because it won't stop other mentally ill people from doing it."[8] Frankel was sentenced to 200 months (16 years 8 months) in federal prison; a state court in Tennessee also sentenced Frankel to 16 years, which was allowed to run concurrently on the condition that he assist officials in recovering lost assets looted from his Tennessee insurance companies.[1]
Several states put Frankel's insurance companies into receivership when it was discovered the companies' primary assets were investments in Frankel's own shell company; among the states affected were Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia.[2]

Platts Names Martin Fraenkel Chief Content Officer 


Former CME Global Head of Energy to Lead Platts’ Global Editorial Team as Company Evolves its Offerings in Data, Price Assessments, News and Analytics


London - May 04, 2015

Platts, a leading global energy and commodities information provider and premier source of benchmark price references, today announced it has named Martin Fraenkel, most recently managing director and global head of energy at CME Group Inc., to the position of chief content officer. In this role, Fraenkel will be responsible for managing the global editorial team, as well as for developing strategies for price assessments and analysis, and all publications for the global commodities markets that Platts covers.

Fraenkel will report to Larry Neal, president of Platts, and serve on the business' executive committee. He will assume his role on June 1 and will be based in London.

"Martin's knowledge of and status in the commodity markets, as well as his success in managing global teams and growing global businesses, will bring immediate value to Platts and to our customers," said Neal. "Martin will drive the continuing development of our editorial team as Platts evolves and expands its offerings across pricing, news and analysis. He is a welcome addition to our team."

"I'm pleased to be joining Platts at this time of rapidly changing markets," said Fraenkel. "The chief content officer role gives me a unique opportunity to employ my markets and derivatives experience for a company steeped in energy and an expanding array of physical markets, and whose customers seek ever more information, data and analysis to support their decision making and risk management."

Over the course of his 30-year career at companies including Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Dresdner Kleinwort, JPMorgan Chase and Phibro, Fraenkel has managed trading businesses, led strategic and business planning for acquisitions and joint ventures and built new business lines.

Fraenkel joined CME Group in 2013 as the head of International Energy and was named global head of Energy in September 2014. In those roles, he was responsible for developing and executing the strategy and product offering in the energy markets for the largest global exchange amid technological and regulatory changes. He also managed a global team that spanned London, Singapore, Houston, New York and Chicago.

Prior to that, as the founder of London International Commodities, a UK consultancy, Fraenkel advised clients including NYSE-Euronext, Louis Dreyfus Commodities and Highland Consulting on acquisitions, strategic and new business planning; portfolio optimization; risk management and hedging strategies.

Fraenkel has an MBA with a specialization in Finance from Insead in Fontainebleau, France; a master's degree in international affairs from the School of Advanced International Studies at The Johns Hopkins University in Washington, DC, and Bologna, Italy, and a bachelor's degree in philosophy, politics and economics from Balliol College, University of Oxford, UK.
