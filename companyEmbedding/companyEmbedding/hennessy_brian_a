Insurance sounds boring and dreary to most people. Not for us at Hennessy, Brian, however. While it is a serious business, we do not see insurance as boring - it is after all the business of keeping people in their homes, from going out of business and getting back on the road – essentially helping people lead normal lives and recover from disaster. This is interesting stuff! We are partnered with the right insurance carrier/s, people we have been doing business with for years. This enables us to comparison shop and gets you (our client) the best deal available. And the best deal is not always about price – but, hey – price is a big factor and we will never stop fighting to get you the best price. We help our clients with all kinds of insurance, but here are the main insurance types our agency focuses on -

Auto insurance – do you know what coverage you have? Most of our clients gloss over when we start talking liability, collision, comprehensive insurance coverages. And why do the limits have to be different based on your specific needs? Rest assured, we understand what is needed to operate a vehicle in and around Norfolk, VA and will handle all the details for you.
Business Insurance – own or operate a business? Do you need insurance before you can execute on a job/contract? Not sure what type of insurance you need? Do you just need the minimum or are you thinking about future exposure to lawsuits and injury claims? Our commercial insurance agents are standing by to help you get the right policy to help your business succeed.
Homeowners insurance – who knows where the value lies in an insurance policy when it comes to something as local-specific as insurance for a structure, building, home in a specific location – your local insurance agent – that’s who! Let us showcase our knowledge of the area in and around Norfolk, VA. You will be confident that you found the best local partner for your insurance needs.
Call us – let’s chat – 757-446-6212

Past performance does not guarantee future results. Fund managers named to the Barron’s list of the industry's top 100 have consistently outperformed their peers. The Barron's/Value Line annual rankings system awards points to managers who generate more stable returns and subtracts points from funds deemed too volatile. A manager with average performance and volatility gets a score of zero. Superior managers get positive scores commensurate with the value they’ve added to a fund’s performance on an annualized basis. Value Line first scanned 1,008 equity funds, screening out those with more than two lead managers and managers with less than three years’ tenure. The remaining funds were then organized by investment objective, and those with less than $200 million in assets were eliminated. 564 managers qualified to be ranked.




Unwavering commitment to our shareholders is a guiding principle at Hennessy Funds.  We strive to always deliver outstanding customer care, and we maintain a strong and dedicated Sales and Service team to serve our clients, shareholders and business partners.

The Funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company. Please read it carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectus can be requested by calling 1-800-966-4354.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Small and medium-capitalization companies may have more limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities may involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risk and differences in accounting methods. A non-diversified fund, one that may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund, is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. A fund that concentrates its investments within one country, one sector, or a small group of industries, such as Japan, Technology, Financials or Natural Gas, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by a fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the borrower will prepay some or all of the principal owed to the issuer. Funds that invest in pooled investment vehicles (including ETFs) may experience higher fees. The formula-based strategy employed by some Funds may cause those Funds to buy or sell securities at times when it may not be advantageous.

Future of Copy Production






Amazingness Through Togetherness
talkoot began as a tool to help Brian Hennessy's small-yet-mighty writing business (Thread). Since 2003, Thread has been providing some of the world’s biggest brands with well-polished product copy—as you might expect, it gets complicated and confusing.
Tired of holding on by their fingernails every time copy monsoon season rolled around, Brian realized they needed a centralized, streamlined way to write, edit, translate and approve copy quickly and at scale.
In looking for a PIM that could handle everything Thread needed to throw at it, he called all his ecom-content-producing friends and found out most everybody was still working in clunky spreadsheets, just like Thread was. So, Brian enlisted some technical help and built a system from the ground up. He called it talkoot, a Finnish word that means “a gathering of friends and neighbors to accomplish a task.” It’s the first content authoring tool for consumer-centric brands. It’s a simple, cloud-based app that helps teams create high volumes of amazing copy that helps spark people to click the ‘buy’ button.

Rising StarsRising Star: Brian Hennessy of Talkoot Wants to Help Consumer Brands Keep Their Story Straight 


Brian Hennessy, Founder of Talkoot.
Stories come in all shapes and sizes. All of us have our own life stories, and then we have the smaller stories that comprise our day-to-day.
Similarly, consumer product companies are constantly communicating stories to their customers—from big brand stories to smaller stories about the evolution of a single product.
But Brian Hennessy, a recent graduate of the 2014 Gorge OEN Bootcamp, thinks that most of these companies could be doing a better job. He doesn’t want to just tell a company’s stories, he wants to make those stories sing—preferably in harmony. His software tool, Talkoot, aims to do just that.
Here’s more from Brian:
The spark that inspired the birth of Talkoot: I’ve had the idea for a long time, but it only came together recently. I was the head writer at adidas for six years and came to understand how storytelling needed to stay consistent throughout an organization, from a company’s brand, to its product categories, to its collections, to its individual products and technologies. My team was writing our part, other agencies were writing their parts, and it all came together at the last minute. In the end, we’d have five different campaigns each telling its own story. Nothing was syncing up. Even when everyone was doing great work, it usually came across sounding schizophrenic and disjointed to the end consumer.

I’m constantly learning things I didn’t know I didn’t know.” (Tweet this.)

What Talkoot does and how it works: Talkoot is a collaborative, cloud-based writing tool that helps agencies and writing teams within large consumer brands write, edit, translate and approve copy quickly and at scale. In other words, it’s a tool that can help brands create seamless, omnichannel stories for their customers. With Talkoot, you can make sure every ecommerce description, tweet, facebook post, banner ad and retail headline are singing from the same brand-relevant, legal-checked songbook.
What differentiates you from your competition: The behemoths like IBM, Citrix, and Microsoft all offer content management systems, but they are so complicated and difficult to use, no one actually writes in them. Most of the leading consumer brands we talked to in our market validation interviews wrote their copy in MS Word or Excel, then cut and pasted it into these types of systems. Talkoot doesn’t replace those big, grey enterprise-wide systems. It provides a high-functioning, human-friendly front end that makes it easier and faster to feed those systems the kinds of great stories that sell products.
How you came up with the name: “Talkoot” is a Finnish word that means a gathering of friends and neighbors for a common purpose.
The biggest surprise in your entrepreneurial experience to date: I’m surprised every single day. I’ve been running Thread, my own content marketing agency, for a while now and I got very good at it. Launching a tech company, however, is very different. I’m constantly learning things I didn’t know I didn’t know. The world is constantly resetting for me, and I always feel like I’m walking into the unknown. It’s unnerving at times, but it can be an amazing experience if you keep the right perspective.
The best thing about being an entrepreneur: Not having to feed the crazy. In the past I’ve taken on work—both freelance projects and full time positions—that paid well, but I wasn’t really inspired by. Now, the hours are long and the future is less certain, but I get to show up everyday to a job I love and work on projects I believe in with people I really like being around.
The biggest challenge: Managing expectations. I have to be vigilant about keeping Talkoot simple. My employees at Thread who are piloting Talkoot have so many great ideas, but if we try to solve too many problems, the tool will become unwieldy.
Next big milestone: Clients. We’ll be piloting the system with adidas, but we need a few more clients to test drive the software.
Benefits of starting a business in Oregon: There’s an amazing network of creative all stars here, who are very open about teaming up and sharing ideas and expertise.
