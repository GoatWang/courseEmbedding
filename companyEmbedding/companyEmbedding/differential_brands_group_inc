OUR BRANDS


Swims
SWIMS was initially established to transform the traditional, utilitarian galosh into a tasteful lifestyle item with bold personality. Norwegians, famous for fearlessly and happily adapting between the heaviest winter months to the 'warm' summer months on the fjord, require ultimate versatility and functionality. SWIMS enables the typical urban Scandinavian to look sleek with a touch of cheekiness, comfort and ultimate functionality fit for both slushy winter days in the city and warm days out on the boat during the summer season. Additional information can be found at: www.swims.com.


Hudson Jeans
Hudson Jeans designs, produces and sells apparel and apparel-related products to the retail and premium markets under the HudsonÂŽ brand and related trademarks. The brand is sold internationally through premium specialty stores and high-end department stores, including Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, Saks, and Neiman Marcus. Additional information can be found at: www.hudsonjeans.com.


Robert Graham
Robert Graham represents the American Eclectic lifestyle brand-where craftsmanship, luxury and style intertwine. As a true design house since 2001, we've been inspiring fashion by developing unique garment-making techniques and complex textile patterns. Our creative seasonal collections encompass: men's sportswear, premium denim, footwear, outerwear, loungewear, accessories, and women's sportswear. With eye-catching mixed fabrics, one-of-a-kind trims and stunning embroideries, Robert Graham embodies luxury at its finest. Each product is unique, character-filled and distinctly Robert Graham--with "knowledge, wisdom, truth" embedded in each garment. Additional information can be found at: www.robertgraham.us.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide
marketing of apparel and footwear products, including denim jeans, related
casual wear, footwear and accessories under our Hudson®, Robert Graham® and
SWIMS® brands. We aim to fill a void in the U.S. public market landscape by
focusing exclusively on brands that develop products for consumers shopping at
premium retailers. 

We began our operations in April 1987 as Innovo, Inc., or Innovo, a Texas
corporation, to manufacture and domestically distribute cut and sewn canvas and
nylon consumer products for the utility, craft, sports­licensed and advertising
specialty markets. We have evolved from producing craft and accessory products
to designing and selling apparel products bearing various brand names. In 1990,
Innovo merged into Elorac Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and was renamed
Innovo Group Inc., which was then renamed Joe's Jeans Inc. in October 2007.  ... More ...

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
