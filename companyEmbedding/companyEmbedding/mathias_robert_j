The Honorable Joseph H. Young, US District Court for the District of Maryland



Recognitions
Best Lawyers recognized Bob as a 2016 ''Lawyer of the Year'' within Securities Litigation in Baltimore. Only a single lawyer in each practice area in each community was honored as a ''Lawyer of the Year.''
Chambers USA has repeatedly recognized Bob as one of America's leading litigation lawyers. The guide has noted he is "much admired," "extremely highly regarded" and an "exceptionally talented trial lawyer." Additionally, he has been "commended for his 'even-keeled and thoughtful' approach." "Clients value his adroit presence in court and how easy it is to work with him." "Sources say: '[H]e understands complex cases, facts and legal issues, and has the ability to analyze them.'"
Bob is also listed in Who's Who in the World, Who's Who in American Law, The Best Lawyers in America and the Lawdragon 500 Leading Litigators in America. In 2010, he was named Best Lawyers’ 2011 Baltimore Bet-the-Company Litigator of the Year. In 2007, Baltimore SmartCEO magazine named him to its list of Maryland's Legal Elite. In 2008, he was named a Maryland Super Lawyer and cited among the top 50 Super Lawyers in Maryland and in 2010, he was named to the Annual Guide to Bet-the-Company Litigation by Best Lawyers.
In 2004, The Daily Record, the newspaper serving Baltimore's business and legal communities, honored him with its Leadership in Law Award. The award recognizes those individuals whose leadership, both in the legal profession and in the community, has made a positive impact on Maryland, and who have demonstrated outstanding achievement in the practice of law; involvement in the profession; support of the community; and mentoring.
In 2008, Bob received the Fifth Annual Baltimore Peacemaker Award for his extensive work with the Community Mediation Program.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
