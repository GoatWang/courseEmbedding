What is Evidence-Based Investing?
Being a better investor doesn’t mean you must have an advanced degree in financial economics, or that you have to be smarter, faster or luckier than the rest of the market. It means:

Knowing and heeding the insights available from those who do have advanced degrees in financial economics.
Structuring your portfolio so that you’re playing with rather than against the market and its expected returns.
Avoiding your own most dangerous behaviors – ingrained through eons of evolution – that tempt you to make the worst financial decisions at all the wrong times.

	About Us » Independence Advisors

















 




Independence Advisors helps our clients achieve what is important to them by bringing clarity to financial decisions and by helping them articulate and achieve their financial and life goals.
We are driven to help people that we care about be good stewards of their wealth, achieve their current and long-term objectives, and improve society. While our clients come from diverse professional backgrounds, they all care about similar things—protecting their legacy for future generations, finding financial peace of mind, and aligning their wealth management choices with their personal interests and goals.
Our goal is to educate our clients and arm them with the information they need to make intelligent decisions about these issues. We accomplish this through a consultative wealth management process that brings focus to the values that are most important to you, and therefore, your plan.


Our Core Values Show that We Value You.
These beliefs underpin every relationship we make and sustain.




Unwavering Integrity
We want to be judged on our character. You can rely on our team to be trustworthy and dependable, and will see our commitment demonstrated in every interaction we have with you.



Live Teamwork
We know more together than we do alone. Our advisors work as a team to create your wealth management solution, and collaborate with carefully selected outside experts to gain further insight that can build your success.





Practice Discipline
We employ sound investing concepts that tune out market noise and remove the emotion from investment decisions, so we can move you toward achieving consistent, long-term success in preserving your wealth.



Improve Continuously
We’re never satisfied with the status quo. To be the best advisor to you, we need to constantly stay abreast of marketplace changes, and push ourselves to continually expand and polish our knowledge and technical capabilities.










We're Just as Invested In Your Future.
 


You can trust us with the complexities of your entire financial picture, including investment counseling, portfolio management, financial planning, tax planning, estate planning, retirement, business succession, insurance and charitable giving. We apply our expertise in an integrated, sophisticated manner, so you gain the benefit of methods that sophisticated investors have used for years.
Learn more about our unique process and how we’ll work together to reach your goals. »

	How We Work » Independence Advisors

















 



Our first priority is to get to know you personally, to gain a holistic understanding of your financial picture, so we can intelligently tailor a plan to your individual needs.
The only way we can help you be a good steward of your wealth, reach your goals and improve society is by learning your personal priorities, family circumstances, and ultimate financial ambitions. Through our unique consultative approach, we build lasting relationships that continually guide the recommendations and choices we make about your wealth.
You'll experience the Independence Wealth Management Process in stages.







Initial Discovery Meeting
WEEK 1: Your initial meeting is an interview, so we can learn what’s most important about you. We examine your current situation and your most important goals.


 





Investment Plan Meeting
WEEK 2: At this meeting, you'll learn how we see your current situation and what investments we recommend to help you reach your goals. This plan forms the foundation for our work together.


 





Mutual Commitment Meeting
WEEK 3: At this meeting, you decide with us whether our firm is right for you. If we both choose to work together, we commit to working together toward achieving everything that is important to you and your family. We also sign documents to put your investment plan into motion.


 





45-Day Follow-Up Meeting
WEEK 9: You won't feel overwhelmed by paperwork when you work with us, even if you have multiple investment accounts. At this meeting, we help you organize all that paperwork. We also answer questions, so that you understand exactly what is happening with your money.


 





Regular Progress Meeting
EVERY 90 DAYS: You'll meet with us at intervals that are convenient for you. This gives us an opportunity to make adjustments based on major changes in your personal or financial situation since our previous meeting. At your first Regular Progress meeting, we'll present our firm's wealth management plan based on our earlier information-gathering. Then, together, we'll prioritize the plan topics of greatest importance to you, so we can begin to address them systematically. We also review your progress toward your long-term financial goals.


 
Throughout this process, we collaborate with a team of carefully selected outside experts to evaluate all aspects of your financial situation and devise comprehensive solutions designed to help you achieve all that is important to you. Our wealth management network in includes Accountants, Estate Attorneys, Risk Managers, and Charitable Advisors.








Always Expect Unbiased Advice.


When you work with Independence Advisors, you'll know that your best interests are always being upheld. As a fee-only advisor, we make decisions tailored to address the breadth of your financial goals, and build plans with only your personal success in mind.
Meet the team that will develop the best solutions for your unique wealth management needs. »

Our Investment Philosophy is
Proven and Repeatable.
We utilize a Nobel Prize–winning approach that is crafted to optimize your investment portfolio over time. We break it down to what we call the “5 Keys to Wealth Management Success”:



 





Diversify to Reduce Risk
Most people understand the basic concept of “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, but emotions can often override reason as stocks rise and fall. Truly diversified investors take a balanced approach and stick with it despite volatility in the markets.


Lower Volatility to Enhance Returns
If you have two investment portfolios with the same average or arithmetic return, it is a mathematical fact that the one with less volatility will have a higher compound return. We design your portfolio with as little volatility as necessary to achieve your goals.
 


Employ Asset Class Investing
An asset class is a group of investments whose risk factors and expected returns are similar. What make asset class funds attractive are their lower operating expenses; lower turnover resulting in lower costs and lower taxes; and consistently maintained market segments.


Global Diversification
U.S. investors tend to favor stocks and bonds of U.S.-based companies, but the price movements between international and U.S. asset classes are often dissimilar, so investing in both can increase your portfolio’s diversification and lessen overall risk.


Design Efficient Portfolios
By plotting each investment combination by its given level of risk and expected return, we are able to describe mathematically a series of points, or “efficient portfolios.” This line forms the efficient frontier. Our job is to make sure that for whatever risk level you choose, you have the highest possible return on the efficient frontier to maximize profitability.
