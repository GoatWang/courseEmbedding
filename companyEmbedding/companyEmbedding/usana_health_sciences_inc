USANA Health Sciences: Strong Moat, Highly Profitable And Growing Sales - USANA Health Sciences Inc. (NYSE:USNA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»USANA Health Sciences: Strong Moat, Highly Profitable And Growing SalesJun. 8.17 | About: USANA Health (USNA) Dr. Tran BioSci Integrated biosci research, consultantMarketplaceIntegrated BioSci InvestingSummaryFounded by a world-class scientist while marketing its products via Olympians, Dr. Oz., and strong sales associates, USANA created the entrenched moats of brand recognition and product awareness.With increasing expansion into the vast Asian markets, the firm is well positioned for continuing sales growth.As the world population is aging, there is an increasing demand for personal wellness products to service degenerative diseases.Despite operating a highly profitable business, the company is on sales as indicated by the mouthwatering P/E of 17.

 Background According to research at the National Institute of Health, global life expectancy is projected to increase by almost eight years (from 68.6 years in 2015 to 76.2 years in 2050). Moreover, the number of people aged 80 and older (in some Asian and Latin America countries) are expected to increase as much as four fold by the same year. With the aging world population comes the rising demand for personal wellness products (aka herbal/dietary supplements) to service the degenerative diseases (like osteoarthritis or the usual "wear and tear") that come with aging. That being said, USANA Health Sciences (NYSE:USNA), a firm based in Salt Lake City, Utah, is poised to capture this niche of growing demand. 

 Source: Google Finance And with the recent completion of its China manufacturing facility, USANA is gearing up for continuing its explosive growth in the Asia-Pacific regions. Of note, the Asian demographics tend to consume more herbal supplements than elsewhere in the world due to their cultural receptiveness toward complementary and alternative medicine. As a result, the oriental environment created the highly favorable market (and reinforced the entrenched moat) for USANA's business operations.
 Low Costs/Less Regulatory Oversees In contrast to a developmental-stage biopharma (that usually incurs approximately $1B to innovate a therapeutic from bench research to commercialization in a decade-long process), firms selling supplements like USANA have key advantages. Notably, there are no strict regulatory hurdles that can hamper corporate growth. Hence, the company is not required to run its products through the time-consuming and cost-burdening process of clinical studies (that are requisites for a biotech firm). Aside from the minor manufacturing and other quality measures, USANA has very few regulatory constraints. Accordingly, the firm can rapidly launch its products with just the following compliance label: "These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease." 

 Source: USANA About The Company Thriving in a less stringent overseeing environment, USANA differentiates itself from competitors due to its sound business model. Founded in 1992 by Myron Wentz, Ph.D., the company "develops and manufactures high-quality, science-based, nutritional and personal care products with the goal of promoting long-term health and reducing the risks of chronic degenerative diseases." Operating in 20 markets worldwide, the firm delivers its products through the direct selling to preferred customers as well as the sales distribution to associates. As of Dec. 31, 2016, there are 471,000 active associates and 93,000 preferred customers worldwide. Capturing The Strategic Market As alluded, the Asian markets have extensive sales growth opportunity (and USANA has been campaigning to capture an increasing presence in this niche). As the fruits of its labor are realized, the company generated more than 75% of the total sales in Asia-Pacific in 2016. It is worthwhile to reiterate that as part of Asia-Pacific, the Chinese market has a vast number of highly receptive customers. And the recent completion of its manufacturing facility in China well positioned the firm for continued sales growth.
 

 Source: Dr. Tran BioSci Advisory For the period ending on Dec. 31, 2016, USANA reported a 15.3% increase and a 1% decrease in sales associates for Asia Pacific and Americas/Europe, respectively. For the same period, active preferred customers in the former region increased by 11.5% while those in the latter area were only 1.6% higher. With more sales associates and preferred customers, this translates into higher sales: 18.3% and 3.1% for Asia Pacific and Americas/Europe, correspondingly. Stellar Brand Recognition/Product Awareness Geography aside, the other growth catalyst for USANA resides in its stellar research and development, as well as its strong relationship with key scientists and research institutions. And by utilizing in-house manufacturing, the company ensures that only top quality products are being produced. Of noteworthy, quality is the key driver for continued brand awareness and sales growth. Interestingly, USANA employs Olympic athletes for products promotion, which greatly fosters brand awareness and adoption. Perhaps, one of the greatest recipes for the firm's marketing success is its strategic sponsorship of Dr. Oz's show. With appropriate incentives, the flamboyant MD has been aggressively campaigning for USANA products. Any fan of Mehmet Oz can attest to his prodigious salesmanship. If he promotes a new product, sales volumes will be catapulted to a record high. 


 Source: USANA Healthy Financials Similar to the strength of its business moat, the company's financial metrics are also quite impressive. For fiscal 2016, the firm generated one billion dollars in revenues. More than 75% of which came from Asia Pacific, as alluded to. During the same period, the company spent $687M and procured $100M in net earnings. Cash and equivalents also strengthened (from $143M in 2015 to $176M in the subsequent year). Furthermore, total debts remain nearly constant at $145M. As USANA is generating the ample cash cushion, it is not surprising that the shares outstanding remain roughly constant at 25M counts for the past five years. There is also no need for dilutive financing when revenues and working capital are growing aggressively while operational spending remains modest. 

 Source: Dr. Tran BioSci Advisory Taken as a whole, the overall trends in revenues, net earnings, working capital, cash and shares outstanding (as indicated in the figure above) are all highly favorable. Those financial metrics signify that the company is healthy and growing aggressively. World-Class Management Chairman and Independent Director Myron W. Wentz, Ph.D., commenced his career as a microbiologist and immunologist. In 1974, he founded Gull Laboratories. Three years later, several of his diagnostic viral assays were FDA approved. Nearly three decades after his initial venture, the enterprising scientist sold his business to start USANA Health Sciences. Furthermore, Wentz's achievement spans beyond the dietary supplements and viral assays: he started Sanoviv Medical Institute (a holistic medical facility with full hospital accreditation located in Baja California). As a philanthropist, the chief also founded two medical centers/laboratories in Uganda and Cambodia (to alleviate the suffering of children afflicted by infectious diseases).
 Market Outperformance The stated cumulative results of strong moats, solid business foundation, stellar management, and continued growth have been handsomely rewarding shareholders. For half a decade, USANA has outperformed competitors as well as the market benchmark (S&P 500) by as much as 400% and +230% in share price appreciation, respectively. 

 Source: USANA 2016 Annual Report Potential Risks According to the world renowned investor Peter Lynch, investing is both an art and a science. Therefore, no precision and accuracy can be guaranteed. That being said, despite promising prospects, investors should be aware of the baseline investing risks in USANA. Since China generated the most sales, certain regulatory changes relating to the direct selling and multi-level marketing can adversely affect operational outcomes. Furthermore, there are strong competitive pressures from Nu Skin Enterprises (NYSE:NUS), Amway International, and Herbalife (NYSE:HLF). Needless to say, we expect USANA's entrenched moat to help the firm in maintaining its competitiveness for years to come. Conclusion As the leader in the highly profitable personal wellness products market that has a strong moat, USANA is still in its aggressive growth phase. Started by a world-class scientist, the company marketed its products via elite athletes and stellar salesmanship (as well as the low cost and strong reputation of its sales associates). It is important for readers to be cognizant that a supplements business thrives on stellar marketing (and USANA is employing marketing approaches that are second to none). Additionally, the nature of the supplements business enabled it to bypass the high regulatory hurdles inherent to the biopharmaceuticals industry. As a result, this enabled the firm to promptly launch new products while incurring the lower costs of innovation and marketing (and to enjoy a premium profits margin).
 Furthermore, the financial analysis suggests that USANA is aggressively expanding with healthy growth metrics. Despite being a highly profitable firm, the company is on sales at a bargain, as indicated by its P/E of 17. Last but not least, we expect the company to continue to generate substantial sales growth (and to reward the patience and intelligent shareholders) as the firm deepens its campaign into Asia-Pacific.

Background[edit]
Usana was founded by immunologist and microbiologist Myron Wentz. Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as "associates") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active "Preferred Customers" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand.
Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9]
From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes “200 Best Small Companies” list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies” list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13]
In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20]
In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22]
On 3 January 2011, Usana completed the transfer of its common stock from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[23]
On 10 May 2011, it was announced that 4 of Usana's executives (President and COO Fred W. Cooper, CFO Jeffrey A. Yates, EVP of Sales Mark H. Wilson, and VP of Finance Riley Timmer) had unexpectedly resigned their positions at the company to pursue an unspecified business opportunity.[24][25]
In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, Usana expended $4.7 million, $5.1 million, and $5.1 million,[26] respectively, on product research and development activities, while earning $648 million, $718 million, and $790 million in total revenue[27] during those same years, respectively. Thus, representing less than 1% of the company's annual revenues.
Products[edit]
Usana produces three product lines: Usana Nutritionals (Essentials, Optimizers, and Digestion/Detox nutritional supplements), Usana Diet & Energy (Reset meal replacement shakes, protein bars, and Rev3 energy drinks), and Sensé personal care (skin care, skin treatment, and hair & body care products). Usana manufactures 90% of its products in-house, including all of its tableted nutritional supplements.[28]
Some products from the Usana Nutritionals range are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).[29][non-primary source needed] Several of Usana's products are certified for product label accuracy by NSF International in the "Dietary Supplements" category.[30][non-primary source needed] Usana Essentials were tested in 2011 by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. The Essentials passed ConsumerLab's test,[31] which included testing of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements.[32]
Commenting on the relatively high cost of Usana's supplements, Anthony Almada, Chief Scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm Imaginutrition, told Forbes "The economic reality of Usana, and other multilevel marketing entities, mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts."[11] These comments were supported by natural health product specialist Prof. Jean-Louis Brazier of the University of Montreal's Faculty of Pharmacy who examined Usana's products for Radio-Canada's consumer report show La Facture. Brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent store-bought items, and no evidence that Usana's products were of better quality than their competitors.[4]
John Cloud, senior writer for Time Magazine, conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of Usana pills, protein bars, powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the company's online evaluation. Cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium, protein, sodium, cholesterol, glucose, and other substances, and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen, which included 3,000 pills at a cost of $1,200. The follow-up test revealed a change in only two values; a 75% increase in vitamin D levels (attributed to the vitamin D3 supplement Cloud had been taking) and a 28 mg/dl increase in high-density lipoprotein, which could not be accounted for. Cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present. This response also led to a 10-lb increase in weight, as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the "licensing effect".[33]
Business model[edit]
Usana, a multilevel marketing company, sells its products primarily via non-employee distributors known as sales "associates" as well as via the Internet. Associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit (referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a "downline").[4] Usana's compensation plan awards commissionable 'points' for sales volume. When the points reach a pre-determined number, the associate is paid. If the points do not reach the payment threshold, they accumulate towards the next week. The firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of 100 volume of products (equivalent to approximately $110–$130) every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation. If this minimum is not maintained, the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid.[34] According to documentation from Usana corporate, 87% of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with 67% of all associates making no commission; 72.2% of the company's commissions are earned by the top 2.31% of associates.[35] According to a 2011 article published by the Salt Lake City Tribune, the firm's FY09 income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the company's 165,710 associates, which includes those just starting out, was $617, while the "top-of-the-pyramid distributors earn an average of $857,865 annually".[36]
The firm's 2010 income disclosure statement defines "associates" as those who are actively building a business, acting as wholesale buyers, or are new distributors.[37] The firm's 2009 SEC 10-K filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers.[38] Associates are independent distributors of Usana products who also purchase their products for personal use. Preferred customers may purchase products, at wholesale prices, strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute. As of July 2011, the firm had 222,000 active Associates and 68,000 preferred customers.[5]
Usana's associates are bound by distributor agreements, which forbid distributors from making "misleading income claims" to potential associates, and from making health claims for the products.[4] However, an investigative report aired by Radio-Canada in February 2009, which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions, found that one group of associates appeared to violate the company's policies. The program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the Canadian legal requirements for multi-level marketing schemes to provide clear, frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant.[4][39] In addition, the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using USANA products to treat illnesses including leukemia.[4]
In 2008, two Canadian Usana distributors were awarded $7 million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company. The firm had terminated their positions in 2003 because it believed the distributor had violated the companies' policies and procedures.[40][41]
New Zealand government statistician for the Commerce Commission, Dr. Murray H. Smith, who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the Commission preceding 10 years, opined in 2008 that very few Usana distributors are likely to become wealthy, and stating "you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme." When asked by the National Business Review to review the firm's business structure and compensation plan, it was Smith’s opinion, from a statistical not legal standpoint, that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate; that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure; and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others. Dr. Smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
Athletics[edit]
Usana is a paid[42][43] sponsor of various athletic organizations.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Usana offers an "Athlete Guarantee Program" to select sponsored athletes. The program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that, should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance (included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations) as a result of taking Usana products, the company will compensate the athlete up to two times his or her current annual earnings up to $1 million USD.[53][54][55]
Women's tennis[edit]
In 2006, Usana signed a co-sponsorship agreement with the WTA tour and extended the agreement in 2011.[56][57] As part of the agreement in 2011, Usana donated $1 to Children's Hunger Fund for every ace scored at a WTA tournament beginning at Wimbledon and continuing through the end of the season.[58][59]
Usana Amphitheatre[edit]
In 2003, Usana became the title sponsor of the USANA Amphitheatre, an outdoor amphitheatre based in West Valley City, Utah with a seating capacity of 20,000.[60] In May 2012, United Concerts announced a continued naming rights partnership with USANA Health Sciences through March 2018.[61][62]
Lawsuit[edit]
On 20 February 2007, Barry Minkow, founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accusing Usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme.[14][63] Usana countered by lodging suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation.
According to an article published in the San Diego Reader, Usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the SEC.[14] The SEC conducted a probe of Usana's business practices in March 2007 and found nothing incriminating, concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended.[64] The company's longtime auditing firm, Grant Thornton, resigned in July 2007 because it could not agree with Usana on procedures for an outside, independent investigation of the charges. Because it had no auditor, Usana was late with official government filings and was not in compliance with SEC and NASDAQ requirements.[citation needed]
On the day Minkow's report was released, Usana's shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35.[12][14] Minkow, acknowledged that he was shorting Usana's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.[3] However, in reference to Usana's lawsuit, news columnist Herb Greenberg commented that the criticism of Minkow "is a bunch of malarkey; he has a right to publish his research, as long as people know his position [in the stock]." Minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down.[14] Usana dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by Usana against Minkow ruling that Usana's claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism.[65] and that Usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims.[66] The judge also cited two examples where Usana failed to refute Minkow's claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands.[66] The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when Usana and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all Usana-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in Usana's stock again.[67] Separately from the settlement, the company paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and his institute under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that Usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.[66]
Minkow had previously served a 7-year prison term starting in 1987 for stock fraud. Minkow has since returned to prison in 2011 for securities fraud unrelated to Usana.[68]

Background[edit]
Usana was founded by immunologist and microbiologist Myron Wentz. Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as "associates") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active "Preferred Customers" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand.
Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9]
From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes “200 Best Small Companies” list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies” list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13]
In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20]
In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22]
On 3 January 2011, Usana completed the transfer of its common stock from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[23]
On 10 May 2011, it was announced that 4 of Usana's executives (President and COO Fred W. Cooper, CFO Jeffrey A. Yates, EVP of Sales Mark H. Wilson, and VP of Finance Riley Timmer) had unexpectedly resigned their positions at the company to pursue an unspecified business opportunity.[24][25]
In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, Usana expended $4.7 million, $5.1 million, and $5.1 million,[26] respectively, on product research and development activities, while earning $648 million, $718 million, and $790 million in total revenue[27] during those same years, respectively. Thus, representing less than 1% of the company's annual revenues.
Products[edit]
Usana produces three product lines: Usana Nutritionals (Essentials, Optimizers, and Digestion/Detox nutritional supplements), Usana Diet & Energy (Reset meal replacement shakes, protein bars, and Rev3 energy drinks), and Sensé personal care (skin care, skin treatment, and hair & body care products). Usana manufactures 90% of its products in-house, including all of its tableted nutritional supplements.[28]
Some products from the Usana Nutritionals range are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).[29][non-primary source needed] Several of Usana's products are certified for product label accuracy by NSF International in the "Dietary Supplements" category.[30][non-primary source needed] Usana Essentials were tested in 2011 by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. The Essentials passed ConsumerLab's test,[31] which included testing of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements.[32]
Commenting on the relatively high cost of Usana's supplements, Anthony Almada, Chief Scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm Imaginutrition, told Forbes "The economic reality of Usana, and other multilevel marketing entities, mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts."[11] These comments were supported by natural health product specialist Prof. Jean-Louis Brazier of the University of Montreal's Faculty of Pharmacy who examined Usana's products for Radio-Canada's consumer report show La Facture. Brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent store-bought items, and no evidence that Usana's products were of better quality than their competitors.[4]
John Cloud, senior writer for Time Magazine, conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of Usana pills, protein bars, powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the company's online evaluation. Cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium, protein, sodium, cholesterol, glucose, and other substances, and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen, which included 3,000 pills at a cost of $1,200. The follow-up test revealed a change in only two values; a 75% increase in vitamin D levels (attributed to the vitamin D3 supplement Cloud had been taking) and a 28 mg/dl increase in high-density lipoprotein, which could not be accounted for. Cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present. This response also led to a 10-lb increase in weight, as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the "licensing effect".[33]
Business model[edit]
Usana, a multilevel marketing company, sells its products primarily via non-employee distributors known as sales "associates" as well as via the Internet. Associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit (referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a "downline").[4] Usana's compensation plan awards commissionable 'points' for sales volume. When the points reach a pre-determined number, the associate is paid. If the points do not reach the payment threshold, they accumulate towards the next week. The firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of 100 volume of products (equivalent to approximately $110–$130) every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation. If this minimum is not maintained, the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid.[34] According to documentation from Usana corporate, 87% of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with 67% of all associates making no commission; 72.2% of the company's commissions are earned by the top 2.31% of associates.[35] According to a 2011 article published by the Salt Lake City Tribune, the firm's FY09 income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the company's 165,710 associates, which includes those just starting out, was $617, while the "top-of-the-pyramid distributors earn an average of $857,865 annually".[36]
The firm's 2010 income disclosure statement defines "associates" as those who are actively building a business, acting as wholesale buyers, or are new distributors.[37] The firm's 2009 SEC 10-K filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers.[38] Associates are independent distributors of Usana products who also purchase their products for personal use. Preferred customers may purchase products, at wholesale prices, strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute. As of July 2011, the firm had 222,000 active Associates and 68,000 preferred customers.[5]
Usana's associates are bound by distributor agreements, which forbid distributors from making "misleading income claims" to potential associates, and from making health claims for the products.[4] However, an investigative report aired by Radio-Canada in February 2009, which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions, found that one group of associates appeared to violate the company's policies. The program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the Canadian legal requirements for multi-level marketing schemes to provide clear, frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant.[4][39] In addition, the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using USANA products to treat illnesses including leukemia.[4]
In 2008, two Canadian Usana distributors were awarded $7 million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company. The firm had terminated their positions in 2003 because it believed the distributor had violated the companies' policies and procedures.[40][41]
New Zealand government statistician for the Commerce Commission, Dr. Murray H. Smith, who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the Commission preceding 10 years, opined in 2008 that very few Usana distributors are likely to become wealthy, and stating "you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme." When asked by the National Business Review to review the firm's business structure and compensation plan, it was Smith’s opinion, from a statistical not legal standpoint, that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate; that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure; and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others. Dr. Smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
Athletics[edit]
Usana is a paid[42][43] sponsor of various athletic organizations.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Usana offers an "Athlete Guarantee Program" to select sponsored athletes. The program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that, should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance (included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations) as a result of taking Usana products, the company will compensate the athlete up to two times his or her current annual earnings up to $1 million USD.[53][54][55]
Women's tennis[edit]
In 2006, Usana signed a co-sponsorship agreement with the WTA tour and extended the agreement in 2011.[56][57] As part of the agreement in 2011, Usana donated $1 to Children's Hunger Fund for every ace scored at a WTA tournament beginning at Wimbledon and continuing through the end of the season.[58][59]
Usana Amphitheatre[edit]
In 2003, Usana became the title sponsor of the USANA Amphitheatre, an outdoor amphitheatre based in West Valley City, Utah with a seating capacity of 20,000.[60] In May 2012, United Concerts announced a continued naming rights partnership with USANA Health Sciences through March 2018.[61][62]
Lawsuit[edit]
On 20 February 2007, Barry Minkow, founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accusing Usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme.[14][63] Usana countered by lodging suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation.
According to an article published in the San Diego Reader, Usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the SEC.[14] The SEC conducted a probe of Usana's business practices in March 2007 and found nothing incriminating, concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended.[64] The company's longtime auditing firm, Grant Thornton, resigned in July 2007 because it could not agree with Usana on procedures for an outside, independent investigation of the charges. Because it had no auditor, Usana was late with official government filings and was not in compliance with SEC and NASDAQ requirements.[citation needed]
On the day Minkow's report was released, Usana's shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35.[12][14] Minkow, acknowledged that he was shorting Usana's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.[3] However, in reference to Usana's lawsuit, news columnist Herb Greenberg commented that the criticism of Minkow "is a bunch of malarkey; he has a right to publish his research, as long as people know his position [in the stock]." Minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down.[14] Usana dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by Usana against Minkow ruling that Usana's claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism.[65] and that Usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims.[66] The judge also cited two examples where Usana failed to refute Minkow's claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands.[66] The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when Usana and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all Usana-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in Usana's stock again.[67] Separately from the settlement, the company paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and his institute under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that Usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.[66]
Minkow had previously served a 7-year prison term starting in 1987 for stock fraud. Minkow has since returned to prison in 2011 for securities fraud unrelated to Usana.[68]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Background[edit]
Usana was founded by immunologist and microbiologist Myron Wentz. Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as "associates") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active "Preferred Customers" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand.
Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9]
From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes “200 Best Small Companies” list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies” list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13]
In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20]
In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22]
On 3 January 2011, Usana completed the transfer of its common stock from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[23]
On 10 May 2011, it was announced that 4 of Usana's executives (President and COO Fred W. Cooper, CFO Jeffrey A. Yates, EVP of Sales Mark H. Wilson, and VP of Finance Riley Timmer) had unexpectedly resigned their positions at the company to pursue an unspecified business opportunity.[24][25]
In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, Usana expended $4.7 million, $5.1 million, and $5.1 million,[26] respectively, on product research and development activities, while earning $648 million, $718 million, and $790 million in total revenue[27] during those same years, respectively. Thus, representing less than 1% of the company's annual revenues.
Products[edit]
Usana produces three product lines: Usana Nutritionals (Essentials, Optimizers, and Digestion/Detox nutritional supplements), Usana Diet & Energy (Reset meal replacement shakes, protein bars, and Rev3 energy drinks), and Sensé personal care (skin care, skin treatment, and hair & body care products). Usana manufactures 90% of its products in-house, including all of its tableted nutritional supplements.[28]
Some products from the Usana Nutritionals range are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).[29][non-primary source needed] Several of Usana's products are certified for product label accuracy by NSF International in the "Dietary Supplements" category.[30][non-primary source needed] Usana Essentials were tested in 2011 by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. The Essentials passed ConsumerLab's test,[31] which included testing of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements.[32]
Commenting on the relatively high cost of Usana's supplements, Anthony Almada, Chief Scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm Imaginutrition, told Forbes "The economic reality of Usana, and other multilevel marketing entities, mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts."[11] These comments were supported by natural health product specialist Prof. Jean-Louis Brazier of the University of Montreal's Faculty of Pharmacy who examined Usana's products for Radio-Canada's consumer report show La Facture. Brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent store-bought items, and no evidence that Usana's products were of better quality than their competitors.[4]
John Cloud, senior writer for Time Magazine, conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of Usana pills, protein bars, powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the company's online evaluation. Cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium, protein, sodium, cholesterol, glucose, and other substances, and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen, which included 3,000 pills at a cost of $1,200. The follow-up test revealed a change in only two values; a 75% increase in vitamin D levels (attributed to the vitamin D3 supplement Cloud had been taking) and a 28 mg/dl increase in high-density lipoprotein, which could not be accounted for. Cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present. This response also led to a 10-lb increase in weight, as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the "licensing effect".[33]
Business model[edit]
Usana, a multilevel marketing company, sells its products primarily via non-employee distributors known as sales "associates" as well as via the Internet. Associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit (referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a "downline").[4] Usana's compensation plan awards commissionable 'points' for sales volume. When the points reach a pre-determined number, the associate is paid. If the points do not reach the payment threshold, they accumulate towards the next week. The firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of 100 volume of products (equivalent to approximately $110–$130) every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation. If this minimum is not maintained, the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid.[34] According to documentation from Usana corporate, 87% of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with 67% of all associates making no commission; 72.2% of the company's commissions are earned by the top 2.31% of associates.[35] According to a 2011 article published by the Salt Lake City Tribune, the firm's FY09 income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the company's 165,710 associates, which includes those just starting out, was $617, while the "top-of-the-pyramid distributors earn an average of $857,865 annually".[36]
The firm's 2010 income disclosure statement defines "associates" as those who are actively building a business, acting as wholesale buyers, or are new distributors.[37] The firm's 2009 SEC 10-K filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers.[38] Associates are independent distributors of Usana products who also purchase their products for personal use. Preferred customers may purchase products, at wholesale prices, strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute. As of July 2011, the firm had 222,000 active Associates and 68,000 preferred customers.[5]
Usana's associates are bound by distributor agreements, which forbid distributors from making "misleading income claims" to potential associates, and from making health claims for the products.[4] However, an investigative report aired by Radio-Canada in February 2009, which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions, found that one group of associates appeared to violate the company's policies. The program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the Canadian legal requirements for multi-level marketing schemes to provide clear, frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant.[4][39] In addition, the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using USANA products to treat illnesses including leukemia.[4]
In 2008, two Canadian Usana distributors were awarded $7 million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company. The firm had terminated their positions in 2003 because it believed the distributor had violated the companies' policies and procedures.[40][41]
New Zealand government statistician for the Commerce Commission, Dr. Murray H. Smith, who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the Commission preceding 10 years, opined in 2008 that very few Usana distributors are likely to become wealthy, and stating "you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme." When asked by the National Business Review to review the firm's business structure and compensation plan, it was Smith’s opinion, from a statistical not legal standpoint, that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate; that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure; and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others. Dr. Smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
Athletics[edit]
Usana is a paid[42][43] sponsor of various athletic organizations.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Usana offers an "Athlete Guarantee Program" to select sponsored athletes. The program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that, should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance (included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations) as a result of taking Usana products, the company will compensate the athlete up to two times his or her current annual earnings up to $1 million USD.[53][54][55]
Women's tennis[edit]
In 2006, Usana signed a co-sponsorship agreement with the WTA tour and extended the agreement in 2011.[56][57] As part of the agreement in 2011, Usana donated $1 to Children's Hunger Fund for every ace scored at a WTA tournament beginning at Wimbledon and continuing through the end of the season.[58][59]
Usana Amphitheatre[edit]
In 2003, Usana became the title sponsor of the USANA Amphitheatre, an outdoor amphitheatre based in West Valley City, Utah with a seating capacity of 20,000.[60] In May 2012, United Concerts announced a continued naming rights partnership with USANA Health Sciences through March 2018.[61][62]
Lawsuit[edit]
On 20 February 2007, Barry Minkow, founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accusing Usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme.[14][63] Usana countered by lodging suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation.
According to an article published in the San Diego Reader, Usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the SEC.[14] The SEC conducted a probe of Usana's business practices in March 2007 and found nothing incriminating, concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended.[64] The company's longtime auditing firm, Grant Thornton, resigned in July 2007 because it could not agree with Usana on procedures for an outside, independent investigation of the charges. Because it had no auditor, Usana was late with official government filings and was not in compliance with SEC and NASDAQ requirements.[citation needed]
On the day Minkow's report was released, Usana's shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35.[12][14] Minkow, acknowledged that he was shorting Usana's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.[3] However, in reference to Usana's lawsuit, news columnist Herb Greenberg commented that the criticism of Minkow "is a bunch of malarkey; he has a right to publish his research, as long as people know his position [in the stock]." Minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down.[14] Usana dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by Usana against Minkow ruling that Usana's claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism.[65] and that Usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims.[66] The judge also cited two examples where Usana failed to refute Minkow's claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands.[66] The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when Usana and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all Usana-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in Usana's stock again.[67] Separately from the settlement, the company paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and his institute under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that Usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.[66]
Minkow had previously served a 7-year prison term starting in 1987 for stock fraud. Minkow has since returned to prison in 2011 for securities fraud unrelated to Usana.[68]

Background[edit]
Usana was founded by immunologist and microbiologist Myron Wentz. Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as "associates") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active "Preferred Customers" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand.
Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9]
From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes “200 Best Small Companies” list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies” list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13]
In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20]
In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22]
On 3 January 2011, Usana completed the transfer of its common stock from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[23]
On 10 May 2011, it was announced that 4 of Usana's executives (President and COO Fred W. Cooper, CFO Jeffrey A. Yates, EVP of Sales Mark H. Wilson, and VP of Finance Riley Timmer) had unexpectedly resigned their positions at the company to pursue an unspecified business opportunity.[24][25]
In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, Usana expended $4.7 million, $5.1 million, and $5.1 million,[26] respectively, on product research and development activities, while earning $648 million, $718 million, and $790 million in total revenue[27] during those same years, respectively. Thus, representing less than 1% of the company's annual revenues.
Products[edit]
Usana produces three product lines: Usana Nutritionals (Essentials, Optimizers, and Digestion/Detox nutritional supplements), Usana Diet & Energy (Reset meal replacement shakes, protein bars, and Rev3 energy drinks), and Sensé personal care (skin care, skin treatment, and hair & body care products). Usana manufactures 90% of its products in-house, including all of its tableted nutritional supplements.[28]
Some products from the Usana Nutritionals range are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).[29][non-primary source needed] Several of Usana's products are certified for product label accuracy by NSF International in the "Dietary Supplements" category.[30][non-primary source needed] Usana Essentials were tested in 2011 by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. The Essentials passed ConsumerLab's test,[31] which included testing of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements.[32]
Commenting on the relatively high cost of Usana's supplements, Anthony Almada, Chief Scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm Imaginutrition, told Forbes "The economic reality of Usana, and other multilevel marketing entities, mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts."[11] These comments were supported by natural health product specialist Prof. Jean-Louis Brazier of the University of Montreal's Faculty of Pharmacy who examined Usana's products for Radio-Canada's consumer report show La Facture. Brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent store-bought items, and no evidence that Usana's products were of better quality than their competitors.[4]
John Cloud, senior writer for Time Magazine, conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of Usana pills, protein bars, powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the company's online evaluation. Cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium, protein, sodium, cholesterol, glucose, and other substances, and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen, which included 3,000 pills at a cost of $1,200. The follow-up test revealed a change in only two values; a 75% increase in vitamin D levels (attributed to the vitamin D3 supplement Cloud had been taking) and a 28 mg/dl increase in high-density lipoprotein, which could not be accounted for. Cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present. This response also led to a 10-lb increase in weight, as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the "licensing effect".[33]
Business model[edit]
Usana, a multilevel marketing company, sells its products primarily via non-employee distributors known as sales "associates" as well as via the Internet. Associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit (referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a "downline").[4] Usana's compensation plan awards commissionable 'points' for sales volume. When the points reach a pre-determined number, the associate is paid. If the points do not reach the payment threshold, they accumulate towards the next week. The firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of 100 volume of products (equivalent to approximately $110–$130) every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation. If this minimum is not maintained, the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid.[34] According to documentation from Usana corporate, 87% of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with 67% of all associates making no commission; 72.2% of the company's commissions are earned by the top 2.31% of associates.[35] According to a 2011 article published by the Salt Lake City Tribune, the firm's FY09 income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the company's 165,710 associates, which includes those just starting out, was $617, while the "top-of-the-pyramid distributors earn an average of $857,865 annually".[36]
The firm's 2010 income disclosure statement defines "associates" as those who are actively building a business, acting as wholesale buyers, or are new distributors.[37] The firm's 2009 SEC 10-K filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers.[38] Associates are independent distributors of Usana products who also purchase their products for personal use. Preferred customers may purchase products, at wholesale prices, strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute. As of July 2011, the firm had 222,000 active Associates and 68,000 preferred customers.[5]
Usana's associates are bound by distributor agreements, which forbid distributors from making "misleading income claims" to potential associates, and from making health claims for the products.[4] However, an investigative report aired by Radio-Canada in February 2009, which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions, found that one group of associates appeared to violate the company's policies. The program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the Canadian legal requirements for multi-level marketing schemes to provide clear, frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant.[4][39] In addition, the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using USANA products to treat illnesses including leukemia.[4]
In 2008, two Canadian Usana distributors were awarded $7 million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company. The firm had terminated their positions in 2003 because it believed the distributor had violated the companies' policies and procedures.[40][41]
New Zealand government statistician for the Commerce Commission, Dr. Murray H. Smith, who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the Commission preceding 10 years, opined in 2008 that very few Usana distributors are likely to become wealthy, and stating "you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme." When asked by the National Business Review to review the firm's business structure and compensation plan, it was Smith’s opinion, from a statistical not legal standpoint, that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate; that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure; and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others. Dr. Smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
Athletics[edit]
Usana is a paid[42][43] sponsor of various athletic organizations.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Usana offers an "Athlete Guarantee Program" to select sponsored athletes. The program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that, should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance (included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations) as a result of taking Usana products, the company will compensate the athlete up to two times his or her current annual earnings up to $1 million USD.[53][54][55]
Women's tennis[edit]
In 2006, Usana signed a co-sponsorship agreement with the WTA tour and extended the agreement in 2011.[56][57] As part of the agreement in 2011, Usana donated $1 to Children's Hunger Fund for every ace scored at a WTA tournament beginning at Wimbledon and continuing through the end of the season.[58][59]
Usana Amphitheatre[edit]
In 2003, Usana became the title sponsor of the USANA Amphitheatre, an outdoor amphitheatre based in West Valley City, Utah with a seating capacity of 20,000.[60] In May 2012, United Concerts announced a continued naming rights partnership with USANA Health Sciences through March 2018.[61][62]
Lawsuit[edit]
On 20 February 2007, Barry Minkow, founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accusing Usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme.[14][63] Usana countered by lodging suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation.
According to an article published in the San Diego Reader, Usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the SEC.[14] The SEC conducted a probe of Usana's business practices in March 2007 and found nothing incriminating, concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended.[64] The company's longtime auditing firm, Grant Thornton, resigned in July 2007 because it could not agree with Usana on procedures for an outside, independent investigation of the charges. Because it had no auditor, Usana was late with official government filings and was not in compliance with SEC and NASDAQ requirements.[citation needed]
On the day Minkow's report was released, Usana's shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35.[12][14] Minkow, acknowledged that he was shorting Usana's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.[3] However, in reference to Usana's lawsuit, news columnist Herb Greenberg commented that the criticism of Minkow "is a bunch of malarkey; he has a right to publish his research, as long as people know his position [in the stock]." Minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down.[14] Usana dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by Usana against Minkow ruling that Usana's claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism.[65] and that Usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims.[66] The judge also cited two examples where Usana failed to refute Minkow's claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands.[66] The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when Usana and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all Usana-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in Usana's stock again.[67] Separately from the settlement, the company paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and his institute under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that Usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.[66]
Minkow had previously served a 7-year prison term starting in 1987 for stock fraud. Minkow has since returned to prison in 2011 for securities fraud unrelated to Usana.[68]

Background[edit]
Usana was founded by immunologist and microbiologist Myron Wentz. Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as "associates") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active "Preferred Customers" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand.
Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9]
From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes “200 Best Small Companies” list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies” list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13]
In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20]
In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22]
On 3 January 2011, Usana completed the transfer of its common stock from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[23]
On 10 May 2011, it was announced that 4 of Usana's executives (President and COO Fred W. Cooper, CFO Jeffrey A. Yates, EVP of Sales Mark H. Wilson, and VP of Finance Riley Timmer) had unexpectedly resigned their positions at the company to pursue an unspecified business opportunity.[24][25]
In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, Usana expended $4.7 million, $5.1 million, and $5.1 million,[26] respectively, on product research and development activities, while earning $648 million, $718 million, and $790 million in total revenue[27] during those same years, respectively. Thus, representing less than 1% of the company's annual revenues.
Products[edit]
Usana produces three product lines: Usana Nutritionals (Essentials, Optimizers, and Digestion/Detox nutritional supplements), Usana Diet & Energy (Reset meal replacement shakes, protein bars, and Rev3 energy drinks), and Sensé personal care (skin care, skin treatment, and hair & body care products). Usana manufactures 90% of its products in-house, including all of its tableted nutritional supplements.[28]
Some products from the Usana Nutritionals range are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).[29][non-primary source needed] Several of Usana's products are certified for product label accuracy by NSF International in the "Dietary Supplements" category.[30][non-primary source needed] Usana Essentials were tested in 2011 by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. The Essentials passed ConsumerLab's test,[31] which included testing of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements.[32]
Commenting on the relatively high cost of Usana's supplements, Anthony Almada, Chief Scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm Imaginutrition, told Forbes "The economic reality of Usana, and other multilevel marketing entities, mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts."[11] These comments were supported by natural health product specialist Prof. Jean-Louis Brazier of the University of Montreal's Faculty of Pharmacy who examined Usana's products for Radio-Canada's consumer report show La Facture. Brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent store-bought items, and no evidence that Usana's products were of better quality than their competitors.[4]
John Cloud, senior writer for Time Magazine, conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of Usana pills, protein bars, powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the company's online evaluation. Cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium, protein, sodium, cholesterol, glucose, and other substances, and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen, which included 3,000 pills at a cost of $1,200. The follow-up test revealed a change in only two values; a 75% increase in vitamin D levels (attributed to the vitamin D3 supplement Cloud had been taking) and a 28 mg/dl increase in high-density lipoprotein, which could not be accounted for. Cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present. This response also led to a 10-lb increase in weight, as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the "licensing effect".[33]
Business model[edit]
Usana, a multilevel marketing company, sells its products primarily via non-employee distributors known as sales "associates" as well as via the Internet. Associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit (referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a "downline").[4] Usana's compensation plan awards commissionable 'points' for sales volume. When the points reach a pre-determined number, the associate is paid. If the points do not reach the payment threshold, they accumulate towards the next week. The firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of 100 volume of products (equivalent to approximately $110–$130) every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation. If this minimum is not maintained, the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid.[34] According to documentation from Usana corporate, 87% of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with 67% of all associates making no commission; 72.2% of the company's commissions are earned by the top 2.31% of associates.[35] According to a 2011 article published by the Salt Lake City Tribune, the firm's FY09 income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the company's 165,710 associates, which includes those just starting out, was $617, while the "top-of-the-pyramid distributors earn an average of $857,865 annually".[36]
The firm's 2010 income disclosure statement defines "associates" as those who are actively building a business, acting as wholesale buyers, or are new distributors.[37] The firm's 2009 SEC 10-K filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers.[38] Associates are independent distributors of Usana products who also purchase their products for personal use. Preferred customers may purchase products, at wholesale prices, strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute. As of July 2011, the firm had 222,000 active Associates and 68,000 preferred customers.[5]
Usana's associates are bound by distributor agreements, which forbid distributors from making "misleading income claims" to potential associates, and from making health claims for the products.[4] However, an investigative report aired by Radio-Canada in February 2009, which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions, found that one group of associates appeared to violate the company's policies. The program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the Canadian legal requirements for multi-level marketing schemes to provide clear, frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant.[4][39] In addition, the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using USANA products to treat illnesses including leukemia.[4]
In 2008, two Canadian Usana distributors were awarded $7 million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company. The firm had terminated their positions in 2003 because it believed the distributor had violated the companies' policies and procedures.[40][41]
New Zealand government statistician for the Commerce Commission, Dr. Murray H. Smith, who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the Commission preceding 10 years, opined in 2008 that very few Usana distributors are likely to become wealthy, and stating "you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme." When asked by the National Business Review to review the firm's business structure and compensation plan, it was Smith’s opinion, from a statistical not legal standpoint, that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate; that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure; and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others. Dr. Smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
Athletics[edit]
Usana is a paid[42][43] sponsor of various athletic organizations.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Usana offers an "Athlete Guarantee Program" to select sponsored athletes. The program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that, should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance (included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations) as a result of taking Usana products, the company will compensate the athlete up to two times his or her current annual earnings up to $1 million USD.[53][54][55]
Women's tennis[edit]
In 2006, Usana signed a co-sponsorship agreement with the WTA tour and extended the agreement in 2011.[56][57] As part of the agreement in 2011, Usana donated $1 to Children's Hunger Fund for every ace scored at a WTA tournament beginning at Wimbledon and continuing through the end of the season.[58][59]
Usana Amphitheatre[edit]
In 2003, Usana became the title sponsor of the USANA Amphitheatre, an outdoor amphitheatre based in West Valley City, Utah with a seating capacity of 20,000.[60] In May 2012, United Concerts announced a continued naming rights partnership with USANA Health Sciences through March 2018.[61][62]
Lawsuit[edit]
On 20 February 2007, Barry Minkow, founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accusing Usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme.[14][63] Usana countered by lodging suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation.
According to an article published in the San Diego Reader, Usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the SEC.[14] The SEC conducted a probe of Usana's business practices in March 2007 and found nothing incriminating, concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended.[64] The company's longtime auditing firm, Grant Thornton, resigned in July 2007 because it could not agree with Usana on procedures for an outside, independent investigation of the charges. Because it had no auditor, Usana was late with official government filings and was not in compliance with SEC and NASDAQ requirements.[citation needed]
On the day Minkow's report was released, Usana's shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35.[12][14] Minkow, acknowledged that he was shorting Usana's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.[3] However, in reference to Usana's lawsuit, news columnist Herb Greenberg commented that the criticism of Minkow "is a bunch of malarkey; he has a right to publish his research, as long as people know his position [in the stock]." Minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down.[14] Usana dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by Usana against Minkow ruling that Usana's claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism.[65] and that Usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims.[66] The judge also cited two examples where Usana failed to refute Minkow's claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands.[66] The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when Usana and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all Usana-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in Usana's stock again.[67] Separately from the settlement, the company paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and his institute under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that Usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.[66]
Minkow had previously served a 7-year prison term starting in 1987 for stock fraud. Minkow has since returned to prison in 2011 for securities fraud unrelated to Usana.[68]

Background[edit]
Usana was founded by immunologist and microbiologist Myron Wentz. Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as "associates") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active "Preferred Customers" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand.
Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9]
From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes “200 Best Small Companies” list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies” list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13]
In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20]
In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22]
On 3 January 2011, Usana completed the transfer of its common stock from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[23]
On 10 May 2011, it was announced that 4 of Usana's executives (President and COO Fred W. Cooper, CFO Jeffrey A. Yates, EVP of Sales Mark H. Wilson, and VP of Finance Riley Timmer) had unexpectedly resigned their positions at the company to pursue an unspecified business opportunity.[24][25]
In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, Usana expended $4.7 million, $5.1 million, and $5.1 million,[26] respectively, on product research and development activities, while earning $648 million, $718 million, and $790 million in total revenue[27] during those same years, respectively. Thus, representing less than 1% of the company's annual revenues.
Products[edit]
Usana produces three product lines: Usana Nutritionals (Essentials, Optimizers, and Digestion/Detox nutritional supplements), Usana Diet & Energy (Reset meal replacement shakes, protein bars, and Rev3 energy drinks), and Sensé personal care (skin care, skin treatment, and hair & body care products). Usana manufactures 90% of its products in-house, including all of its tableted nutritional supplements.[28]
Some products from the Usana Nutritionals range are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).[29][non-primary source needed] Several of Usana's products are certified for product label accuracy by NSF International in the "Dietary Supplements" category.[30][non-primary source needed] Usana Essentials were tested in 2011 by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. The Essentials passed ConsumerLab's test,[31] which included testing of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements.[32]
Commenting on the relatively high cost of Usana's supplements, Anthony Almada, Chief Scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm Imaginutrition, told Forbes "The economic reality of Usana, and other multilevel marketing entities, mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts."[11] These comments were supported by natural health product specialist Prof. Jean-Louis Brazier of the University of Montreal's Faculty of Pharmacy who examined Usana's products for Radio-Canada's consumer report show La Facture. Brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent store-bought items, and no evidence that Usana's products were of better quality than their competitors.[4]
John Cloud, senior writer for Time Magazine, conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of Usana pills, protein bars, powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the company's online evaluation. Cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium, protein, sodium, cholesterol, glucose, and other substances, and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen, which included 3,000 pills at a cost of $1,200. The follow-up test revealed a change in only two values; a 75% increase in vitamin D levels (attributed to the vitamin D3 supplement Cloud had been taking) and a 28 mg/dl increase in high-density lipoprotein, which could not be accounted for. Cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present. This response also led to a 10-lb increase in weight, as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the "licensing effect".[33]
Business model[edit]
Usana, a multilevel marketing company, sells its products primarily via non-employee distributors known as sales "associates" as well as via the Internet. Associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit (referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a "downline").[4] Usana's compensation plan awards commissionable 'points' for sales volume. When the points reach a pre-determined number, the associate is paid. If the points do not reach the payment threshold, they accumulate towards the next week. The firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of 100 volume of products (equivalent to approximately $110–$130) every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation. If this minimum is not maintained, the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid.[34] According to documentation from Usana corporate, 87% of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with 67% of all associates making no commission; 72.2% of the company's commissions are earned by the top 2.31% of associates.[35] According to a 2011 article published by the Salt Lake City Tribune, the firm's FY09 income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the company's 165,710 associates, which includes those just starting out, was $617, while the "top-of-the-pyramid distributors earn an average of $857,865 annually".[36]
The firm's 2010 income disclosure statement defines "associates" as those who are actively building a business, acting as wholesale buyers, or are new distributors.[37] The firm's 2009 SEC 10-K filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers.[38] Associates are independent distributors of Usana products who also purchase their products for personal use. Preferred customers may purchase products, at wholesale prices, strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute. As of July 2011, the firm had 222,000 active Associates and 68,000 preferred customers.[5]
Usana's associates are bound by distributor agreements, which forbid distributors from making "misleading income claims" to potential associates, and from making health claims for the products.[4] However, an investigative report aired by Radio-Canada in February 2009, which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions, found that one group of associates appeared to violate the company's policies. The program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the Canadian legal requirements for multi-level marketing schemes to provide clear, frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant.[4][39] In addition, the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using USANA products to treat illnesses including leukemia.[4]
In 2008, two Canadian Usana distributors were awarded $7 million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company. The firm had terminated their positions in 2003 because it believed the distributor had violated the companies' policies and procedures.[40][41]
New Zealand government statistician for the Commerce Commission, Dr. Murray H. Smith, who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the Commission preceding 10 years, opined in 2008 that very few Usana distributors are likely to become wealthy, and stating "you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme." When asked by the National Business Review to review the firm's business structure and compensation plan, it was Smith’s opinion, from a statistical not legal standpoint, that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate; that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure; and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others. Dr. Smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
Athletics[edit]
Usana is a paid[42][43] sponsor of various athletic organizations.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Usana offers an "Athlete Guarantee Program" to select sponsored athletes. The program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that, should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance (included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations) as a result of taking Usana products, the company will compensate the athlete up to two times his or her current annual earnings up to $1 million USD.[53][54][55]
Women's tennis[edit]
In 2006, Usana signed a co-sponsorship agreement with the WTA tour and extended the agreement in 2011.[56][57] As part of the agreement in 2011, Usana donated $1 to Children's Hunger Fund for every ace scored at a WTA tournament beginning at Wimbledon and continuing through the end of the season.[58][59]
Usana Amphitheatre[edit]
In 2003, Usana became the title sponsor of the USANA Amphitheatre, an outdoor amphitheatre based in West Valley City, Utah with a seating capacity of 20,000.[60] In May 2012, United Concerts announced a continued naming rights partnership with USANA Health Sciences through March 2018.[61][62]
Lawsuit[edit]
On 20 February 2007, Barry Minkow, founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accusing Usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme.[14][63] Usana countered by lodging suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation.
According to an article published in the San Diego Reader, Usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the SEC.[14] The SEC conducted a probe of Usana's business practices in March 2007 and found nothing incriminating, concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended.[64] The company's longtime auditing firm, Grant Thornton, resigned in July 2007 because it could not agree with Usana on procedures for an outside, independent investigation of the charges. Because it had no auditor, Usana was late with official government filings and was not in compliance with SEC and NASDAQ requirements.[citation needed]
On the day Minkow's report was released, Usana's shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35.[12][14] Minkow, acknowledged that he was shorting Usana's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.[3] However, in reference to Usana's lawsuit, news columnist Herb Greenberg commented that the criticism of Minkow "is a bunch of malarkey; he has a right to publish his research, as long as people know his position [in the stock]." Minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down.[14] Usana dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by Usana against Minkow ruling that Usana's claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism.[65] and that Usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims.[66] The judge also cited two examples where Usana failed to refute Minkow's claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands.[66] The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when Usana and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all Usana-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in Usana's stock again.[67] Separately from the settlement, the company paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and his institute under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that Usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.[66]
Minkow had previously served a 7-year prison term starting in 1987 for stock fraud. Minkow has since returned to prison in 2011 for securities fraud unrelated to Usana.[68]

Background[edit]
Usana was founded by immunologist and microbiologist Myron Wentz. Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as "associates") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active "Preferred Customers" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand.
Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9]
From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes “200 Best Small Companies” list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies” list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13]
In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20]
In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22]
On 3 January 2011, Usana completed the transfer of its common stock from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[23]
On 10 May 2011, it was announced that 4 of Usana's executives (President and COO Fred W. Cooper, CFO Jeffrey A. Yates, EVP of Sales Mark H. Wilson, and VP of Finance Riley Timmer) had unexpectedly resigned their positions at the company to pursue an unspecified business opportunity.[24][25]
In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, Usana expended $4.7 million, $5.1 million, and $5.1 million,[26] respectively, on product research and development activities, while earning $648 million, $718 million, and $790 million in total revenue[27] during those same years, respectively. Thus, representing less than 1% of the company's annual revenues.
Products[edit]
Usana produces three product lines: Usana Nutritionals (Essentials, Optimizers, and Digestion/Detox nutritional supplements), Usana Diet & Energy (Reset meal replacement shakes, protein bars, and Rev3 energy drinks), and Sensé personal care (skin care, skin treatment, and hair & body care products). Usana manufactures 90% of its products in-house, including all of its tableted nutritional supplements.[28]
Some products from the Usana Nutritionals range are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).[29][non-primary source needed] Several of Usana's products are certified for product label accuracy by NSF International in the "Dietary Supplements" category.[30][non-primary source needed] Usana Essentials were tested in 2011 by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. The Essentials passed ConsumerLab's test,[31] which included testing of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements.[32]
Commenting on the relatively high cost of Usana's supplements, Anthony Almada, Chief Scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm Imaginutrition, told Forbes "The economic reality of Usana, and other multilevel marketing entities, mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts."[11] These comments were supported by natural health product specialist Prof. Jean-Louis Brazier of the University of Montreal's Faculty of Pharmacy who examined Usana's products for Radio-Canada's consumer report show La Facture. Brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent store-bought items, and no evidence that Usana's products were of better quality than their competitors.[4]
John Cloud, senior writer for Time Magazine, conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of Usana pills, protein bars, powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the company's online evaluation. Cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium, protein, sodium, cholesterol, glucose, and other substances, and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen, which included 3,000 pills at a cost of $1,200. The follow-up test revealed a change in only two values; a 75% increase in vitamin D levels (attributed to the vitamin D3 supplement Cloud had been taking) and a 28 mg/dl increase in high-density lipoprotein, which could not be accounted for. Cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present. This response also led to a 10-lb increase in weight, as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the "licensing effect".[33]
Business model[edit]
Usana, a multilevel marketing company, sells its products primarily via non-employee distributors known as sales "associates" as well as via the Internet. Associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit (referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a "downline").[4] Usana's compensation plan awards commissionable 'points' for sales volume. When the points reach a pre-determined number, the associate is paid. If the points do not reach the payment threshold, they accumulate towards the next week. The firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of 100 volume of products (equivalent to approximately $110–$130) every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation. If this minimum is not maintained, the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid.[34] According to documentation from Usana corporate, 87% of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with 67% of all associates making no commission; 72.2% of the company's commissions are earned by the top 2.31% of associates.[35] According to a 2011 article published by the Salt Lake City Tribune, the firm's FY09 income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the company's 165,710 associates, which includes those just starting out, was $617, while the "top-of-the-pyramid distributors earn an average of $857,865 annually".[36]
The firm's 2010 income disclosure statement defines "associates" as those who are actively building a business, acting as wholesale buyers, or are new distributors.[37] The firm's 2009 SEC 10-K filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers.[38] Associates are independent distributors of Usana products who also purchase their products for personal use. Preferred customers may purchase products, at wholesale prices, strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute. As of July 2011, the firm had 222,000 active Associates and 68,000 preferred customers.[5]
Usana's associates are bound by distributor agreements, which forbid distributors from making "misleading income claims" to potential associates, and from making health claims for the products.[4] However, an investigative report aired by Radio-Canada in February 2009, which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions, found that one group of associates appeared to violate the company's policies. The program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the Canadian legal requirements for multi-level marketing schemes to provide clear, frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant.[4][39] In addition, the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using USANA products to treat illnesses including leukemia.[4]
In 2008, two Canadian Usana distributors were awarded $7 million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company. The firm had terminated their positions in 2003 because it believed the distributor had violated the companies' policies and procedures.[40][41]
New Zealand government statistician for the Commerce Commission, Dr. Murray H. Smith, who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the Commission preceding 10 years, opined in 2008 that very few Usana distributors are likely to become wealthy, and stating "you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme." When asked by the National Business Review to review the firm's business structure and compensation plan, it was Smith’s opinion, from a statistical not legal standpoint, that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate; that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure; and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others. Dr. Smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
Athletics[edit]
Usana is a paid[42][43] sponsor of various athletic organizations.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Usana offers an "Athlete Guarantee Program" to select sponsored athletes. The program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that, should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance (included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations) as a result of taking Usana products, the company will compensate the athlete up to two times his or her current annual earnings up to $1 million USD.[53][54][55]
Women's tennis[edit]
In 2006, Usana signed a co-sponsorship agreement with the WTA tour and extended the agreement in 2011.[56][57] As part of the agreement in 2011, Usana donated $1 to Children's Hunger Fund for every ace scored at a WTA tournament beginning at Wimbledon and continuing through the end of the season.[58][59]
Usana Amphitheatre[edit]
In 2003, Usana became the title sponsor of the USANA Amphitheatre, an outdoor amphitheatre based in West Valley City, Utah with a seating capacity of 20,000.[60] In May 2012, United Concerts announced a continued naming rights partnership with USANA Health Sciences through March 2018.[61][62]
Lawsuit[edit]
On 20 February 2007, Barry Minkow, founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accusing Usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme.[14][63] Usana countered by lodging suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation.
According to an article published in the San Diego Reader, Usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the SEC.[14] The SEC conducted a probe of Usana's business practices in March 2007 and found nothing incriminating, concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended.[64] The company's longtime auditing firm, Grant Thornton, resigned in July 2007 because it could not agree with Usana on procedures for an outside, independent investigation of the charges. Because it had no auditor, Usana was late with official government filings and was not in compliance with SEC and NASDAQ requirements.[citation needed]
On the day Minkow's report was released, Usana's shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35.[12][14] Minkow, acknowledged that he was shorting Usana's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.[3] However, in reference to Usana's lawsuit, news columnist Herb Greenberg commented that the criticism of Minkow "is a bunch of malarkey; he has a right to publish his research, as long as people know his position [in the stock]." Minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down.[14] Usana dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by Usana against Minkow ruling that Usana's claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism.[65] and that Usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims.[66] The judge also cited two examples where Usana failed to refute Minkow's claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands.[66] The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when Usana and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all Usana-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in Usana's stock again.[67] Separately from the settlement, the company paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and his institute under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that Usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.[66]
Minkow had previously served a 7-year prison term starting in 1987 for stock fraud. Minkow has since returned to prison in 2011 for securities fraud unrelated to Usana.[68]

Background[edit]
Usana was founded by immunologist and microbiologist Myron Wentz. Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as "associates") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active "Preferred Customers" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand.
Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9]
From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes “200 Best Small Companies” list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies” list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13]
In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20]
In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22]
On 3 January 2011, Usana completed the transfer of its common stock from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[23]
On 10 May 2011, it was announced that 4 of Usana's executives (President and COO Fred W. Cooper, CFO Jeffrey A. Yates, EVP of Sales Mark H. Wilson, and VP of Finance Riley Timmer) had unexpectedly resigned their positions at the company to pursue an unspecified business opportunity.[24][25]
In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, Usana expended $4.7 million, $5.1 million, and $5.1 million,[26] respectively, on product research and development activities, while earning $648 million, $718 million, and $790 million in total revenue[27] during those same years, respectively. Thus, representing less than 1% of the company's annual revenues.
Products[edit]
Usana produces three product lines: Usana Nutritionals (Essentials, Optimizers, and Digestion/Detox nutritional supplements), Usana Diet & Energy (Reset meal replacement shakes, protein bars, and Rev3 energy drinks), and Sensé personal care (skin care, skin treatment, and hair & body care products). Usana manufactures 90% of its products in-house, including all of its tableted nutritional supplements.[28]
Some products from the Usana Nutritionals range are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).[29][non-primary source needed] Several of Usana's products are certified for product label accuracy by NSF International in the "Dietary Supplements" category.[30][non-primary source needed] Usana Essentials were tested in 2011 by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. The Essentials passed ConsumerLab's test,[31] which included testing of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements.[32]
Commenting on the relatively high cost of Usana's supplements, Anthony Almada, Chief Scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm Imaginutrition, told Forbes "The economic reality of Usana, and other multilevel marketing entities, mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts."[11] These comments were supported by natural health product specialist Prof. Jean-Louis Brazier of the University of Montreal's Faculty of Pharmacy who examined Usana's products for Radio-Canada's consumer report show La Facture. Brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent store-bought items, and no evidence that Usana's products were of better quality than their competitors.[4]
John Cloud, senior writer for Time Magazine, conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of Usana pills, protein bars, powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the company's online evaluation. Cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium, protein, sodium, cholesterol, glucose, and other substances, and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen, which included 3,000 pills at a cost of $1,200. The follow-up test revealed a change in only two values; a 75% increase in vitamin D levels (attributed to the vitamin D3 supplement Cloud had been taking) and a 28 mg/dl increase in high-density lipoprotein, which could not be accounted for. Cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present. This response also led to a 10-lb increase in weight, as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the "licensing effect".[33]
Business model[edit]
Usana, a multilevel marketing company, sells its products primarily via non-employee distributors known as sales "associates" as well as via the Internet. Associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit (referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a "downline").[4] Usana's compensation plan awards commissionable 'points' for sales volume. When the points reach a pre-determined number, the associate is paid. If the points do not reach the payment threshold, they accumulate towards the next week. The firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of 100 volume of products (equivalent to approximately $110–$130) every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation. If this minimum is not maintained, the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid.[34] According to documentation from Usana corporate, 87% of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with 67% of all associates making no commission; 72.2% of the company's commissions are earned by the top 2.31% of associates.[35] According to a 2011 article published by the Salt Lake City Tribune, the firm's FY09 income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the company's 165,710 associates, which includes those just starting out, was $617, while the "top-of-the-pyramid distributors earn an average of $857,865 annually".[36]
The firm's 2010 income disclosure statement defines "associates" as those who are actively building a business, acting as wholesale buyers, or are new distributors.[37] The firm's 2009 SEC 10-K filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers.[38] Associates are independent distributors of Usana products who also purchase their products for personal use. Preferred customers may purchase products, at wholesale prices, strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute. As of July 2011, the firm had 222,000 active Associates and 68,000 preferred customers.[5]
Usana's associates are bound by distributor agreements, which forbid distributors from making "misleading income claims" to potential associates, and from making health claims for the products.[4] However, an investigative report aired by Radio-Canada in February 2009, which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions, found that one group of associates appeared to violate the company's policies. The program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the Canadian legal requirements for multi-level marketing schemes to provide clear, frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant.[4][39] In addition, the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using USANA products to treat illnesses including leukemia.[4]
In 2008, two Canadian Usana distributors were awarded $7 million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company. The firm had terminated their positions in 2003 because it believed the distributor had violated the companies' policies and procedures.[40][41]
New Zealand government statistician for the Commerce Commission, Dr. Murray H. Smith, who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the Commission preceding 10 years, opined in 2008 that very few Usana distributors are likely to become wealthy, and stating "you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme." When asked by the National Business Review to review the firm's business structure and compensation plan, it was Smith’s opinion, from a statistical not legal standpoint, that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate; that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure; and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others. Dr. Smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
Athletics[edit]
Usana is a paid[42][43] sponsor of various athletic organizations.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Usana offers an "Athlete Guarantee Program" to select sponsored athletes. The program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that, should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance (included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations) as a result of taking Usana products, the company will compensate the athlete up to two times his or her current annual earnings up to $1 million USD.[53][54][55]
Women's tennis[edit]
In 2006, Usana signed a co-sponsorship agreement with the WTA tour and extended the agreement in 2011.[56][57] As part of the agreement in 2011, Usana donated $1 to Children's Hunger Fund for every ace scored at a WTA tournament beginning at Wimbledon and continuing through the end of the season.[58][59]
Usana Amphitheatre[edit]
In 2003, Usana became the title sponsor of the USANA Amphitheatre, an outdoor amphitheatre based in West Valley City, Utah with a seating capacity of 20,000.[60] In May 2012, United Concerts announced a continued naming rights partnership with USANA Health Sciences through March 2018.[61][62]
Lawsuit[edit]
On 20 February 2007, Barry Minkow, founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accusing Usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme.[14][63] Usana countered by lodging suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation.
According to an article published in the San Diego Reader, Usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the SEC.[14] The SEC conducted a probe of Usana's business practices in March 2007 and found nothing incriminating, concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended.[64] The company's longtime auditing firm, Grant Thornton, resigned in July 2007 because it could not agree with Usana on procedures for an outside, independent investigation of the charges. Because it had no auditor, Usana was late with official government filings and was not in compliance with SEC and NASDAQ requirements.[citation needed]
On the day Minkow's report was released, Usana's shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35.[12][14] Minkow, acknowledged that he was shorting Usana's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.[3] However, in reference to Usana's lawsuit, news columnist Herb Greenberg commented that the criticism of Minkow "is a bunch of malarkey; he has a right to publish his research, as long as people know his position [in the stock]." Minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down.[14] Usana dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by Usana against Minkow ruling that Usana's claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism.[65] and that Usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims.[66] The judge also cited two examples where Usana failed to refute Minkow's claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands.[66] The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when Usana and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all Usana-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in Usana's stock again.[67] Separately from the settlement, the company paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and his institute under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that Usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.[66]
Minkow had previously served a 7-year prison term starting in 1987 for stock fraud. Minkow has since returned to prison in 2011 for securities fraud unrelated to Usana.[68]

Background[edit]
Usana was founded by immunologist and microbiologist Myron Wentz. Usana, based in West Valley City, Utah, sells its products through multilevel marketing: distributors recruit and profit from other distributors.[4] The products are not available through retail channels, but instead can only be obtained through one of its independent distributors (referred to as "associates") or by direct order through the company.[4] At the end of 2014, The company had 349,000 active associates and 81,000 active "Preferred Customers" in its worldwide distribution network.[5] In 2012, 91% of product sales was purchased by associates[6] As of 2013, its products are marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, France, Colombia and Thailand.
Beginning in 1993, Dallin A. Larsen served as Usana's vice president of sales (and later as consultant to Usana's president and special advisor to the board of directors) prior to founding the MLM beverage company Monavie in 2005.[7][8][9]
From 2004 to 2006, Usana was named on Forbes “200 Best Small Companies” list.[10] In 2007, Usana was not included on Forbes' 200 Best Small Companies” list, and an article in the magazine quoted industry and government experts who had raised questions about Usana's business practices and products.[11][12] Usana responded by issuing a press release denying that the company had breached a $40 million loan agreement with Bank of America.[13]
In 2007, Usana faced repeated controversy after several of its executives were discovered to have made false statements regarding their qualifications.[3] The executives included Denis Waitley, a member of the board of directors who had falsely claimed to hold a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School;[3][14] sales associate Ladd McNamara, who quit the company's medical advisory board after it was discovered that his license to practice medicine had been revoked;[15][16][17] Vice President of Research and Development, Timothy Wood, who was found to have a doctorate in forestry, as opposed to biology as he had claimed;[18] and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gilbert Fuller, who had continued to use the title of CPA,[19] though his CPA license had expired 10 years before he joined Usana in 1996.[3][18][20]
In August 2007, Usana announced that it had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its shares were subject to delisting from the NASDAQ because the company had failed to have the financial information in its quarterly Form 10-Q reviewed by an independent auditor. Usana reported this was due to their public accountant resigning and not yet being replaced.[21] In October 2007, Usana announced that NASDAQ had determined they were in compliance and their stock would continue to be listed.[22]
On 3 January 2011, Usana completed the transfer of its common stock from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange.[23]
On 10 May 2011, it was announced that 4 of Usana's executives (President and COO Fred W. Cooper, CFO Jeffrey A. Yates, EVP of Sales Mark H. Wilson, and VP of Finance Riley Timmer) had unexpectedly resigned their positions at the company to pursue an unspecified business opportunity.[24][25]
In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, Usana expended $4.7 million, $5.1 million, and $5.1 million,[26] respectively, on product research and development activities, while earning $648 million, $718 million, and $790 million in total revenue[27] during those same years, respectively. Thus, representing less than 1% of the company's annual revenues.
Products[edit]
Usana produces three product lines: Usana Nutritionals (Essentials, Optimizers, and Digestion/Detox nutritional supplements), Usana Diet & Energy (Reset meal replacement shakes, protein bars, and Rev3 energy drinks), and Sensé personal care (skin care, skin treatment, and hair & body care products). Usana manufactures 90% of its products in-house, including all of its tableted nutritional supplements.[28]
Some products from the Usana Nutritionals range are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).[29][non-primary source needed] Several of Usana's products are certified for product label accuracy by NSF International in the "Dietary Supplements" category.[30][non-primary source needed] Usana Essentials were tested in 2011 by ConsumerLab.com in their Multivitamin and Multimineral Supplements Review of 38 of the leading multivitamin/multimineral products sold in the U.S. and Canada. The Essentials passed ConsumerLab's test,[31] which included testing of selected index elements, their ability to disintegrate in solution per United States Pharmacopeia guidelines, lead contamination threshold set in California Proposition 65, and meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements.[32]
Commenting on the relatively high cost of Usana's supplements, Anthony Almada, Chief Scientist of the nutritional supplement industry consulting firm Imaginutrition, told Forbes "The economic reality of Usana, and other multilevel marketing entities, mandates that their products invariably lack robust distinctiveness and convincing evidence of consumer relevance and superiority—achievable through rigorous clinical trials only—to their retail counterparts."[11] These comments were supported by natural health product specialist Prof. Jean-Louis Brazier of the University of Montreal's Faculty of Pharmacy who examined Usana's products for Radio-Canada's consumer report show La Facture. Brazier found that they cost two to three times the price of equivalent store-bought items, and no evidence that Usana's products were of better quality than their competitors.[4]
John Cloud, senior writer for Time Magazine, conducted an evaluation of nutritional supplements in which he took a regimen of Usana pills, protein bars, powder drinks and psyllium fiber as recommended by the company's online evaluation. Cloud took a blood test prior to taking the products to determine the levels of calcium, protein, sodium, cholesterol, glucose, and other substances, and then was tested again five months after taking the supplement regimen, which included 3,000 pills at a cost of $1,200. The follow-up test revealed a change in only two values; a 75% increase in vitamin D levels (attributed to the vitamin D3 supplement Cloud had been taking) and a 28 mg/dl increase in high-density lipoprotein, which could not be accounted for. Cloud also experienced a placebo response where that act of taking the supplements made him feel more vigorous despite no physiological reasons being present. This response also led to a 10-lb increase in weight, as the belief he was more vigorous led to his making poorer dietary decisions—a phenomenon referred to as the "licensing effect".[33]
Business model[edit]
Usana, a multilevel marketing company, sells its products primarily via non-employee distributors known as sales "associates" as well as via the Internet. Associates may be eligible to receive commissions based on their own product sales as well as through sales made by any new distributors they recruit (referred to in multilevel marketing parlance as a "downline").[4] Usana's compensation plan awards commissionable 'points' for sales volume. When the points reach a pre-determined number, the associate is paid. If the points do not reach the payment threshold, they accumulate towards the next week. The firm requires that associates purchase a minimum of 100 volume of products (equivalent to approximately $110–$130) every four weeks in order to remain eligible to receive compensation. If this minimum is not maintained, the distributor loses the points that have accumulated but not yet been paid.[34] According to documentation from Usana corporate, 87% of associates fail to make enough from commissions to recover the cost of their qualifying purchases with 67% of all associates making no commission; 72.2% of the company's commissions are earned by the top 2.31% of associates.[35] According to a 2011 article published by the Salt Lake City Tribune, the firm's FY09 income disclosure statement indicated that the average yearly income of the company's 165,710 associates, which includes those just starting out, was $617, while the "top-of-the-pyramid distributors earn an average of $857,865 annually".[36]
The firm's 2010 income disclosure statement defines "associates" as those who are actively building a business, acting as wholesale buyers, or are new distributors.[37] The firm's 2009 SEC 10-K filing draws a distinction between associates and preferred customers.[38] Associates are independent distributors of Usana products who also purchase their products for personal use. Preferred customers may purchase products, at wholesale prices, strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute. As of July 2011, the firm had 222,000 active Associates and 68,000 preferred customers.[5]
Usana's associates are bound by distributor agreements, which forbid distributors from making "misleading income claims" to potential associates, and from making health claims for the products.[4] However, an investigative report aired by Radio-Canada in February 2009, which included hidden camera filming of recruitment and other sessions, found that one group of associates appeared to violate the company's policies. The program contrasted the information about potential revenues presented at meetings and in written materials with the Canadian legal requirements for multi-level marketing schemes to provide clear, frequent and complete information about the revenue of the typical participant.[4][39] In addition, the same group of associates were filmed making recommendations for using USANA products to treat illnesses including leukemia.[4]
In 2008, two Canadian Usana distributors were awarded $7 million in compensation for damages related to their wrongful dismissal from the company. The firm had terminated their positions in 2003 because it believed the distributor had violated the companies' policies and procedures.[40][41]
New Zealand government statistician for the Commerce Commission, Dr. Murray H. Smith, who served as an expert witness in every pyramid scheme case brought by the Commission preceding 10 years, opined in 2008 that very few Usana distributors are likely to become wealthy, and stating "you can make a very strong argument that this could be a pyramid scheme." When asked by the National Business Review to review the firm's business structure and compensation plan, it was Smith’s opinion, from a statistical not legal standpoint, that the firm demonstrated a number of characteristics commonly occurring in pyramid schemes including that most members recoup less than what they pay to participate; that those at the top of the structure are more likely to make more than those on the bottom of the structure; and that as the company grows it will become harder to recruit others. Dr. Smith also noted the company’s significant turnover in distributors making it necessary to continually recruit.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]
Athletics[edit]
Usana is a paid[42][43] sponsor of various athletic organizations.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Usana offers an "Athlete Guarantee Program" to select sponsored athletes. The program permits selected participants to enter into an agreement with company stipulating that, should an athlete enrolled in the program test positive for a banned substance (included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations) as a result of taking Usana products, the company will compensate the athlete up to two times his or her current annual earnings up to $1 million USD.[53][54][55]
Women's tennis[edit]
In 2006, Usana signed a co-sponsorship agreement with the WTA tour and extended the agreement in 2011.[56][57] As part of the agreement in 2011, Usana donated $1 to Children's Hunger Fund for every ace scored at a WTA tournament beginning at Wimbledon and continuing through the end of the season.[58][59]
Usana Amphitheatre[edit]
In 2003, Usana became the title sponsor of the USANA Amphitheatre, an outdoor amphitheatre based in West Valley City, Utah with a seating capacity of 20,000.[60] In May 2012, United Concerts announced a continued naming rights partnership with USANA Health Sciences through March 2018.[61][62]
Lawsuit[edit]
On 20 February 2007, Barry Minkow, founder of the Fraud Discovery Institute, distributed a 500-page report to officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accusing Usana of operating an illegal pyramid scheme.[14][63] Usana countered by lodging suits against Minkow and his company claiming defamation and stock manipulation.
According to an article published in the San Diego Reader, Usana was subsequently the subject of an investigation by the SEC.[14] The SEC conducted a probe of Usana's business practices in March 2007 and found nothing incriminating, concluding its inquiry with no enforcement action recommended.[64] The company's longtime auditing firm, Grant Thornton, resigned in July 2007 because it could not agree with Usana on procedures for an outside, independent investigation of the charges. Because it had no auditor, Usana was late with official government filings and was not in compliance with SEC and NASDAQ requirements.[citation needed]
On the day Minkow's report was released, Usana's shares had traded at $61.19 but by August the share price had tumbled to less than $35.[12][14] Minkow, acknowledged that he was shorting Usana's shares, hoping to profit from a drop in the stock price.[3] However, in reference to Usana's lawsuit, news columnist Herb Greenberg commented that the criticism of Minkow "is a bunch of malarkey; he has a right to publish his research, as long as people know his position [in the stock]." Minkow had revealed in the report that he was betting for the stock to go down.[14] Usana dropped the defamation suit and in March 2008 U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell threw out four of the five claims brought by Usana against Minkow ruling that Usana's claims violated California's anti-SLAPP law for suing Minkow for fair criticism.[65] and that Usana did not show a reasonable probability of winning on those claims.[66] The judge also cited two examples where Usana failed to refute Minkow's claims that their products were overpriced and of no better quality than other lower-priced brands.[66] The remaining charge of stock manipulation was settled in July 2008 when Usana and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all Usana-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in Usana's stock again.[67] Separately from the settlement, the company paid $142,510 in attorney fees to Minkow and his institute under an order from federal Magistrate Samuel Alba. Court documents show that Usana never pursued others whom they suspected of being part of the alleged stock manipulation nor did they ask for an injunction, their only avenue of release in this case.[66]
Minkow had previously served a 7-year prison term starting in 1987 for stock fraud. Minkow has since returned to prison in 2011 for securities fraud unrelated to Usana.[68]
