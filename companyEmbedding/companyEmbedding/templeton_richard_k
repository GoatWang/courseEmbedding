Richard K. Templeton





 Chairman, President & CEO 
 Texas Instruments Incorporated  

 
 
Tweet 












Rich Templeton is chairman, president and chief executive officer of Texas Instruments. He became chairman of the board in April 2008, and president and chief executive officer in May 2004. He has served on the company’s board of directors since July 2003. 
 
From April 2000 through April 2004, Templeton was chief operating officer of TI. He was executive vice president of the company and president of TI’s Semiconductor business from June 1996 through April 2004. In these roles, Templeton is credited with helping to define and execute TI’s strategy to focus on semiconductors for signal processing. Operationally, he guided the company during this transformation. 
 
As CEO, he continued to reshape the company, focusing resources on growth opportunities in TI’s core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing. His strategic actions included the major acquisition of National Semiconductor and the successful wind down of the company’s wireless operations, which enabled resources to be more fully focused on areas of long-term return. Templeton has led TI to become the global leader in analog integrated circuits, while still maintaining the company’s strengths in embedded systems and digital signal processing.
 
Throughout this process, he has maintained the company’s strategic investments in R&D and manufacturing, while expanding the size of the sales and applications engineering team to better serve TI customers. Within the manufacturing arena, he oversaw the opportune purchases of capacity and equipment that have positioned the company for future growth, while allowing its capital spending levels to decline compared with historical levels. Under his leadership, TI has emerged stronger, with better technological and product positions in both its core businesses.
 
Templeton joined the company in 1980 after earning a bachelor’s of science degree in electrical engineering from Union College in New York. He spent his operational career in the company’s Semiconductor business, beginning in sales and eventually becoming president of the entire business.
 
He topped the list of Institutional Investor’s Best Semiconductor CEOs in America for several years, most recently for 2015. 
 
In addition to his TI duties, Templeton has focused much of his external energies on public issues and initiatives that advance the high-tech industry, technological innovation and education, particularly STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) education. Under his leadership, TI and the TI Foundation have invested $150 million over the last five years to strengthen global education programs, including K-12 STEM teaching and student achievement. In the U.S., these efforts are especially directed toward increasing skills among under-resourced communities and under-represented minority students and girls. The industry has taken note of Templeton’s commitment and passion in this area. In 2012, the Semiconductor Industry Association awarded him its highest honor, citing his service as a “vigorous advocate for STEM education and longtime champion of research and innovation.”

	Compensation data is from the latest available proxy statements filed through Mar. 23, 2012. Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based on Mar. 14, 2011 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the S & P 500 (a score of 100 = the S & P 500).

History of innovation
Over the last 85 years, we have re-engineered ourselves many times. Although today we are a global technology company, our spirit of innovation has been at the heart of who we are for decades, dating back to our founders and their vision for TI at its inception in 1930.

1930s 
Geophysical Service Inc., a small oil and gas company, opens in 1930.  The founders’ entrepreneurial spirit, vision and innovation laid a solid foundation for today’s Texas Instruments.

We begin applying signal processing technologies to submarine detection, then radar, leading us to create an electronics equipment lab and manufacturing unit in1946.

1950s
We officially become Texas Instruments Incorporated, entering the semiconductor industry by inventing the silicon transistor in 1954. In 1958, TIer Jack Kilby invents the integrated circuit, revolutionizing the semi- conductor industry and paving the way for all modern electronics.

1960s
We develop the first electronic hand-held calculator (Cal Tech) in 1967 while also focusing our efforts on developing faster, smaller and more powerful TI chips. The Apollo Lunar Exploration Module containing TI components lands on the moon during this decade.

1970s
Transforming appliances, consumer electronics and industrial equipment, we introduce the first single-chip microcontroller (MCU) combining all the elements of computing onto one piece of silicon. TI engineers also invent a single-chip speech synthesizer, debuting in the TI Speak & Spell.

1980s
In 1980, TI introduces its first commercial single-chip digital signal processors (DSP) and produces a microprocessor optimized for high-speed digital signal processing. Five years later, TI invents the digital micromirror device (also known as the DLP ® chip), which serves as the foundation for award-winning DLP technology (Emmy® 1998) and DLP Cinema® (Academy® Plaque 2009). 
Larry Hornbeck, inventor of the Digital Micromirror Device, known as the DLP chip.

1990s
TI takes embedded processing to the next level with the creation of the MSP430™ MCU  – a family of MCUs designed for their low cost and power efficiency - and introduces the first applications processor designed specifically for mobile phones (OMAP). TI also takes a leadership position in the graphic calculator industry with the TI-81 in 1990 and the introduction of the TI-83 Plus with FLASH™–ROM memory in 1999.

TI expands its focus on analog and embedded processing technologies, producing semiconductor technologies across a diverse set of applications. We launch the first family of single-chip digital cellphone solutions (LoCosto) in 2007, making cellphone technology more affordable and adding features to make phones smarter. Kilby Labs Dallas also opens in 2009, fueling innovation at TI and creating an environment for our engineers to rapidly explore breakthrough and emerging technologies.

TI acquires National Semiconductor in 2011, laying the groundwork for next-generation signal-processing technology. 
We develop groundbreaking innovations across the company, including the industry’s first micro power boost charger for energy harvesting applications (the bq25504) and TI Education Technology’s first graphing calculator with full color, backlit displays (TI-NSpire CX (Cas) ) in 2011,  the first Bluetooth low-energy kit with six sensors for fast mobile app development (the SimpleLink™ Bluetooth® low-energy SensorTag kit )  and DLP® evaluation module allowing developers to utilize DLP technology in industrial and medical markets in 2012 and the industry’s first inductance-to-digital converter (LDC1000) in 2013.
