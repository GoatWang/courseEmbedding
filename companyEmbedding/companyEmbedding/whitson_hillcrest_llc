Hillcrest Hotel To Be Converted Into Luxury Apartments
 By                                              Monica Garske

Wednesday, Jan 11, 2017
























San Diego-based company, SENTRE, dba Whitson Hillcrest, LLC, recently acquired an 80-room hotel in Hillcrest. The company plans to convert the property, located at 606 Washington Street near State Route 163, into luxury apartments “with a vintage flair.”

For the past 20 years, the property has been operating as the Sommerset Suites Hotel. After the conversion, the building will be rebranded as The Whitson, named after William Wesley Whitson, a well-known developer of the Hillcrest community.

Here are some renderings of what The Whitson will become once it reopens as apartments this summer:

About The Whitson Company, LLC is a small family owned real estate and investment company located in Southern California.  We have a rich history in both commercial and residential asset investments and property management. President / Barry WhitsonVP of Operations / Jenny WhitsonVP of Marketing / Amy Whitson 













































 It all started when...In 1887, The Whitson Company started with a lumber yard in John's River, California.  William Wesley Whitson decided to move south to San Diego, in hopes of new opportunities.  In the late summer of 1906, Whitson, a 20-year-old San Diego resident, had heard from his sister-in-law, Laura Anderson, that there was a bargain in land to be had north of downtown. Anderson, a secretary to a firm of attorneys, knew about the George Hill estate, 40 acres of stoney hill, which could be had for $115,000. A real bargain since an adjoining parcel went for $500,000.Young Whitson agreed and rounded up money from his friends and relatives to use as good faith money. He then secured a loan of $115,000 from recent heirs to a fortune back east, to be paid back within 30 days.  In 30 days, Whitson sold shares in his proposed Hillcrest Company then raised $100,000 from banks. In the fall of 1906 the first stockholders meeting was held. Board members included M. L. Ward, Mabel Humiston, G. A. Davidson, Ed Fletcher, W. W. Whitson and J. F. Malone. The majority of shares were held by Whitson. The property extended from Sixth Avenue to Second Avenue and from University Avenue north to Lewis Street. It was surveyed in December, and a subdivision was filed in January of 1907. The deed to the Hillcrest Company was recorded August 2, 1907, and the company was in business.City records show that the first transaction for this area was in 1870, when the city deeded it to Mary Kearney, who sold it in February 1871 to C. D. Arnold and D. Choate, both well-known subdividers. It passed through a succession of hands before the Hillcrest Company bought it from the Hill heirs.Sales were made from a tract office located at Fifth and University (photo above), and houses were built through his contracts. In 1906, Whitson says the neighborhood was sparsely settled, St. Josephs's Hospital (now Scripps Mercy) was at Sixth and University. A one-story house was located near the corner of Fifth and University and one house on Third Avenue, with a few places of business several blocks to the east. Lot sizes were 40 x 135, 50 x 135 or 50 x 100. Prices ranged from $2,500 (Second Avenue), $5,000 corner lots, $3,500 (Third Avenue), $7,500 (Bread and Cie lot) and $10,000 (Corvette Diner lot). South of University Avenue, two subdivisions were already laid out, extending from Sixth to Second Avenue, from University Avenue down to Brookes. A tract from Robinson south to Brookes, called the Brookes Addition, was recorded in April 1889, and a tract from University south to Robinson, known as the Nutt's Addition, was recorded in April 1890.There were at least 43 houses known to have been built by the Hillcrest Company within the original Hillcrest subdivision. Of all the Hillcrest Company houses built here, 16 structures still exist. Of these, eight have been left with virtually no alterations. Most of these are located in the 3900 and 4000 blocks of Third Avenue.Later in WWW's life, he moved to Los Angeles where he managed several motion picture theaters. Everntually his sons and grandsons took over The Whitson Company.  The Company was dormant for 35 years, until Barry Whitson, Great Grandson of William Wesley Whitson re-established the company in 2016.Today, The Whitson Company is working to preserve the legacy of the projects across Southern California by providing historical background of the projects previously developed, owned, and/or operated by the Whitson Company.  As a company with a rich history in real estate development and management, we aim to engage in investment opportunities that preserve the historical nature of the project while providing a sustainable and equitable opportunity for future generations.  Our mission is to provide spaces and experiences that generate a connection to history and inspire pride of ownership to others, just as WWW once did.

		WHITSON'S MOIST CHILI SEASONING - 
		"A pot of chili ready in 15 minutes!"

		From Whitson Chile Products, LLC. 4oz jar.
	
WHITSON'S GREEN FANG -

		TERLINGUA SWEET HOTS Pickles - 
		"Crisp, sweet sliced cucumber pickles seasoned with jalapenos, garlic and Whitson's own blend of spices finish this Terlingua classic. Yummy with sandwiches, chopped up in tuna salad, or as a sweet treat right out of the jar. These are my own recipe." - Sarah 
		From Whitson Chili Products, LLC. 16oz jar.

		TALES FROM THE TERLINGUA PORCH by Blair Pittman - 
		You have to understand about porches in the desert.  They offer shade in a sun-scoured landscape, they offer nice views, usually, and with any luck, you can purchase a cold drink somewhere nearby and consume it in good company.  The porch in the Terlingua Ghostown may be the greatest porch anywhere.  An ever-changing cast of regulars and passers-through share shade and stories, like as not.

		Writer and photographer Blair Pittman has collected this bunch of yarns that are told and retold on the porch of the Terlingua Trading Company, which served as the porch of the Chisos Mining Company until the mercury mines closed in the 1940s.  The 51-page book includes 18 tales such as “The Porch and the B-17,” “Gringo Mujado (White Wetback),” and “Ross Maxwell and the Panther Farm.”

MORE TALES FROM THE TERLINGUA PORCH, VOL. 2 
		by Blair Pittman - 
		Blair Pittman's very popular Tales from the Terlingua Porch, which came out in 2005, has now been followed by a new volume of yarns and wisdom, More Tales from the Terlingua Porch, Vol. 2. It is full of stories of fun and floods on the Rio Grande system, animals (domestic and desert), the not-to-be-missed "Dynamite Holding Contest," and more. 

		
 Each copy, with more great illustrations by Mark Kneeskern, is signed by the author. This is a must for any Terlingua-loving soul.

        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to

        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
