Threat of substitute products or services

				October 23, 2014			


After a day of shopping, I decided to create this post. While shopping I paid attention to my buying options during my trip. I could choose large a hypermarket store such as Target. I could also choose traditionally retail stores such as Safeway or Whole Foods. I decided to go to Target because I know … More Threat of substitute products or services

Research and Expertise





Classical and Contemporary Rhetorics
Much of my work (in particular, my book) has looked to intersections between Classical / Late Antique rhetorics and contemporary theoretical concerns. My current activity is informed by this early work as I look to other (digital, aural, filmic) modes of persuasion.

 



Critical Theory (particularly psychoanalysis)
Much of my academic inquiry is informed by my continuing study of (Lacanian) psychoanalysis and the theoretical work in conversation with it.

 



New Media/Visual Rhetoric/Film
Along with ongoing work in film/television studies, I am interested in digital production and sound studies as rhetorical enterprises.

 



Early Jewish Thought/Exegesis
Early Jewish thought is an alternative and often contrary starting point for histories of Western rhetoric and I am committed to its inclusion in the discussion of the rhetorical canon.

 



Creative Writing/The Craft of Poetry
My MFA is in creative writing and I continue to teach, write, and publish poetry.

"The Future of Sin"
Late in A Rhetoric of Motives, Kenneth Burke claims that “[b]iologically, it is of the essence of man to desire. But by the same token, biologically it is of the essence of man to be sated” on his way to positing a “pure persuasion” that is both transcendent and object-less. In most popular media, The Future has always been about desire and its satiation. This presentation takes up recent popular films and television--Ex Machina, Humans, HBO’s new Westworld series--that project social transgression (sin) into the future to allow a practical means by which an audience may safely enjoy. These projects perform a kind of epideictic rhetoric for a satiated Future by casting contemporary desires forward so that they will have been addressed, tamed, via civic and commercial routines. The “symbolic getting” offered by these films delays any real getting and thereby guarantees that each iteration of sin is partial, frustrating, and enjoyable. Through a ritual of getting by not-getting yet, The Future promises what Burke calls “a purchasable miracle.”

April  2016 
"Englines of Desire"
Despite (or because of) Jacques Lacan’s insistence that there is no such thing as sexual rapport, popular films and television series have much invested in projecting presumed and successful heteronormative relationships onto our screens. Todd McGowan argues that these consummate relationships continue to have such heft because they offer “a fantasmatic solution to a fundamental social antagonism--that of sexual difference” (2011). The fantasy of complementarity that these entertainment pieces allow may be a valuable prosthetic, as they assure us “that antagonism is empirical rather than ontological and that we can always overcome it.” Speculative film and television let us know that we will overcome that antagonism in the future, often with the help of fantastic machines.
Recent television and film (Black Mirror 2012-2013, Ex Machina 2015, Humans 2015) both perform and critique the (primarily masculine) fantasy future of happy union via a technological Other. If “Woman is the symptom of Man,” these often posit mechanical and digital prosthetics for a missing feminine. And they demonstrate that, contrary to the assumption that digital immediacy and the constancy of social networks are marks of the public sphere encroaching on private space, the private actually colonizes the public (Zizek 2014). How might fantasy adapt to tensions between the call of public participation and private enjoyment? In what ways do ubiquitous and almost invisible technologies offer to shape the sexual (non)relationship? And what does technology want?

"The Old Sound of Now""
Naively, we understand that listening, like reading, takes time. Noise often lasts beyond an instant, but recordings of sound persist beyond context while still retaining traces of their context. “Sound…is audible only over time. We hear sound as it decays” (Rushkoff). Recently, Mark Fisher applied the Derridian term hauntology to a kind of music arising primarily in Great Britain. Using techniques derived from field recording and musique concrete, the project of this kind of performance is to aesthetically organize the pops, crackles, and scratches of old recordings such that context is overprivileged to the extent that it is derealized. The hauntological contemporizes the old, thereby reifying the atemporal, flattening potential of the digital archive.

May  2012 
"Against and Old-fashioned Future; or The Authenticity of What's Next"
Recent work by Bruce Sterling, Kevin Kelly, and especially the graphic novelist Warren Ellis argue for (and sometimes critique) the future (of whatever) by tying their futures to a recognizable past so that an audience may identify with the project or product. In effect, the past may be reconstituted as a future we can identify with in the present. It may be impossible to present a truly revolutionary future insofar as the myth of progress--“where are our flying cars!”--enforces the standard story and maintains what Sterling has called the atemporality of the early 21st century. Steven Shaviro has pointed out that we have had the same cyberpunk future for the past 30 years. Reading the above with and against Kenneth Burke’s and Jacques Lacan’s insights on identification, antagonism, and the subject, this presentation explores deliberative arguments for and critiques of an Authentic Future by examining ways by which these arguments depend on nostalgia to present a palatable what-should-or-may-be-next.

May  2010 
“Home Bodies: Prosthetic People and the Economy of Desire”
This presentation considers the founding of home life via the unhomely addition of Reborn infants and RealDoll girlfriends as prosthetic devices intended to alleviate suffering and both create and avoid family.  Burke (1969) insists that identity as such is founded consubstantially, in relation to other people, of course, but also to objects, beliefs, etc.  This speaker will follow Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori's (1970, 2005) hypothosis of the Uncanny Valley - suplemented by psychoanalytic insights (Fink 1995 & 2007, Lacan 1998, McGowan 2008) - to elaborate on the manners in which these prostheses facilitate/hinder the social role of family and sexual identity for some subjects.  The argument is that these artificial arrangements not only mirror so-called normal human relashionships but in fact function as amplifications of accepted social practice for outsiders.  The effect for the participant is a felt inclusion into a regularized social order while, for the outsider, the result is discomfort stemming from the prosthetic's vulgar indication of a fundamental lack in the human.   Zizek (1997) claims that the prosthetic addresses a lack, not a loss; it is not a replacement, but a supplement.  Reborns and the Real Dolls make clear that one can purchase a child or mail-order a lover and that, as unheimliche as it seems, one version of family may be a home for bodies.

Speculation and Worldbuilding
Speculation.wiki is a consistently updated site of resources and links, as well as the portal for a set of concurrently-run courses that I taught with colleagues at other institutions. These courses focused on world-building fictions and their uses. Students from different institutions and disciplines collaborated on speculative projects (both digital and physical) in order to model other possibilities. What situations are possible that maybe do not exactly exist right now? What problems may attend? What benefits? After the initial run, our plan is to invite other courses in different disciplines in an ongoing world-building enterprise. The sit is consistently updated with links to tools and information.

Courses









ENGL 2303-001
Writing About Film
This course will focus on (some of) those films that offer versions of the high school experience, certainly with an eye to what they say, but just as certainly with an eye toward how they present whatever they seem to say.  This means that, though this is not a course in film studies or history but “writing about film,” we will pay a great deal of attention to the language and elements of films (those that are common with literature, for instance, and those that are specific to the genre).

ENGL 5330-001
Psychoanalysis & Film
Since the late1960s, film theory has been largely—if broadly—psychoanalytic. “Psychoanalysis & Film” is an introduction to (particularly Lacanian) psychoanalytic thought via film studies and readings.  The expected outcome of this short session is relatively conversant knowledge in some principles of Lacanian psychoanalytic theory and use for film analysis.

ENGL 5350-001
History of Rhetoric I - Classical Rhetoric
This course is an introduction to the earliest traditions of rhetoric. But as we follow the grand recit of rhetoric from the Sophists to Augustine—in some sense, a journey from display to interpretation—we will consider what these texts allege regarding the definition and limits of rhetoric and its relationship to/with other (ancient and contemporary) critical systems. What are the differences (if any) between rhetoric and other systems that claim a body of knowledge (philosophy, religion, politics)? Can the differences (if any) be expressed in terms of suppositions about what words (should, can) do? In particular, we will be looking at some examples of late antique Rabbinic exegesis with an eye (or ear) toward discovering how the tradition may fit with the study of classical rhetorics.

ENGL 2303-001
Pop Culture in Contemporary Poetry
While primarily a literature course intended to investigate the place and purpose of poetry, this course also assumes that poetry needn’t necessarily draw from a (learned or received) past.  Fine, engaging poetry may also find its material in what we all already (think we) know.  For this reason, all of the poems we will read this session appeal in some manner to popular (some might call it low, but not us) culture in order to say something, if not new, then hopefully useful.

Though the emphasis of this course is necessarily on craft, writing poems also means engaging with other (written, visual, aural, etc.) texts. That is, poetry has a relationship with the world.

ENGL 2303-001
Writing About Film
This course will focus on (some of) those films that offer versions of the high school experience, certainly with an eye to what they say, but just as certainly with an eye toward how they present whatever they seem to say.  This means that, though this is not a course in film studies or history but “writing about film,” we will pay a great deal of attention to the language and elements of films (those that are common with literature, for instance, and those that are specific to the genre).  Beyond the work we do in class, grades will be based on various shorter assignments and analytical-critical studies of films.  Since time in class is limited, students will be expected to spend time outside of class seeing and studying additional films

ENGL 5380-001
The Future of Sin
“The Future of Sin” considers some of the ways we talk about The Future as a site of indulgence or transgression. Taking seriously William Gibson’s claim that “the future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed,” we are most interested in how futures are figured, what these visions say about our own wants, and the means through which a future can give body to desire.
Readings will be various and may include work from rhetorical theory, design and human/computer interface theory, literature, design fiction, and new futurism. Much of the coursework will be born-digital — it’s the future — but no prior knowledge or ability in specific computer applications is required. Class will be divided between seminar discussions and studio work and will consist of both solitary and collaborative projects, including several presentations.

ENGL 4399-001
Speculation & World Building
Presenting a convincing world means that you have to be convincing. “Speculation & World Building” will consider some of the ways we imagine a world other than ours, how we argue for and describe it in order to better understand what sorts of arguments are successful and what “successful” means. Readings will be various and may include work from rhetorical theory, design and human/computer interface theory, literature, design fiction, and new futurism. Class time will be divided between seminar discussions and studio work and will consist of both solitary and collaborative projects (some writing, some making and building) with other students in our course and at TCU and Alma College, where related courses are being offered.
Readings will be various and may include work from psychoanalytic theory, literature, design fiction, and new futurism.

Good poetry doesn’t necessarily need to draw from a (boring) past.

So, we will read fine poems about Superman, Godzilla, Barbie, cartoon characters, all with an eye to discovering what these poems share with the poetic tradition without having to repeat that tradition verbatim.

ENGL 5311-001
Foundations of Rhetoric and Composition
If we take as given that there is a single field of study called (in whatever order you prefer) Rhetoric-and-Composition, then there is likely (supposed to be) some intersection of composition and rhetoric that we can address both theoretically and practically. Very early on, for instance, Rhetoric Theory becomes (at least in some circles) an underpinning of education. And even now it is difficult to imagine an artless persuasion (though some academic articles make a stab at it). This course is not a survey, but a reading across (some of the) the field(s) in order to come to some thoughts of what may be useful about the bar we have set in the middle of Rhet/Comp studies, where the stakes are currently, and what might continue to matter.

Taking seriously William Gibson’s claim that “the future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed,” we will be most interested in how the future is figured and what we can learn of the motivations and assumptions behind those descriptions.
Readings will be various and may include work from rhetorical theory, design and human/computer interface theory, literature, design fiction, and new futurism. Some of the authors whose work we will consider are Rachel Armstrong, Ian Bogost, James Bridle, Jamais Cascio, Warren Ellis, Kevin Kelly, and Bruce Sterling. All coursework will be born-digital, but no prior knowledge or ability in specific computer applications is required.

ENGL 3375-001
CREATIVE WRITING
This course is designed to introduce students to the world of contemporary creative writing, particularly to the 3 genres of literary prose fiction, creative non-fiction essay writing and poetry.  This will be accomplished through discussions, readings, writing assignments (both in-class writing prompts and group exercises as well as takehome, typed writing assignments), and workshops.  All students will compose original works of creative non-fiction, prose fiction and poetry, culminating in three final, polished portfolios (one poetry portfolio of at least 4 poems, one fiction portfolio containing a final, polished short story of 8-10 pages and one creative non-fiction portfolio containing a final, polished creative non-fiction essay of  8-10 pages). We will practice the art of writing poetry, creative non-fiction and fiction critically as well as creatively.  We will not hold one person’s work against another’s—there is no corner on good, and there is enough excellence to go around—but against the light of the finest that has been—is being—written, and we will encourage one another to reach beyond our current grasps, remembering that we are here not in the service of ego, but of art.  We will also read and discuss some of the best contemporary poetry, non-fiction essays and short stories to see what we can steal.  By “Steal” I don’t mean plagiarize (more on this as the term progresses). Unlike literature courses, where the discussions focus mainly on subject and theme, we will discuss these works in terms of craft.  We will be architects of language, and will learn the best ways to deliver meaning to an audience.  Specifically, we will concentrate on the three “S’s” of good writing: style, structure, and specifics. Most importantly, we will learn that writing is work, but an enjoyable (and quite rewarding) form of work.
