Under his guidance, Merloni Elettrodomestici increased sales each year and closed 2003 with €3,008 million, 21% more than the previous year.[4] In 2004 Andrea Guerra left this position to join Luxottica,[5] and his place at Merloni Elettrodomestici was taken over by general manager Marco Milani.[6] In addition to official recognition from Merloni Elettrodomestici for the results achieved during his tenure,[7] Andrea Guerra was included in the 2004 Financial Times list of "25 business stars".

Other positions[edit]
Andrea Guerra is a member of the committee of Italian Strategic Fund (Fondo Strategico Italiano S.p.A.),[14] a member of boards of Amplifon S.p.A.[15] and Ariston Thermo S.p.A. , and a shareholder of online newspaper Linkiesta.[16] He also sits on the boards of directors of Bocconi university and Save the Children Italia Onlus.[17] Over the years he has held the position of director on the boards of Parmalat S.p.A., Banca Nazionale del Lavoro[18] and Dea Capital S.p.A.[19] In the February 2014, when Matteo Renzi's government was being formed, some Italian media suggested his possible involvement in the government team,[20] this possibility denied by Guerra himself.[21]

Early career and experience at Merloni Elettrodomestici[edit]
Guerra was born in Milan, and began his professional activity with Marriott Italia, where he rose to the office of marketing manager.[2] In 1994 he joined Merloni Elettrodomestici, where for six years he held responsible jobs in sales, production and central services. In 2000 he was appointed group's CEO,[3] replacing outgoing manager Francesco Caio which was at the end of his mandate, and thus became the Italian youngest CEO of a listed company. Under his guidance, Merloni Elettrodomestici increased sales each year and closed 2003 with €3,008 million, 21% more than the previous year.[4] In 2004 Andrea Guerra left this position to join Luxottica,[5] and his place at Merloni Elettrodomestici was taken over by general manager Marco Milani.[6] In addition to official recognition from Merloni Elettrodomestici for the results achieved during his tenure,[7] Andrea Guerra was included in the 2004 Financial Times list of "25 business stars".
The Luxottica period[edit]
Andrea Guerra joined Luxottica in 2004 as CEO, in place of Roberto Chemello, who had held that position since 1985.[8] Under Guerra's stewardship, the value of Luxottica's share price rose from €14 in 2003[9] to €40 in 2014, and company sales almost tripled, from €2.8 billion in 2003 to over €7 billion in 2013.[10] Andrea Guerra stayed his position until 1 September 2014,[11] when Leonardo del Vecchio, Luxottica's founder and chairman announced his departure at the end of the board of directors term.[12] In recognition of his work at Luxottica, Guerra was named the second-best CEO in Italy in the 2014 Thomson Reuters classification, behind Mario Greco, Assicurazioni Generali's CEO.[13]
Other positions[edit]
Andrea Guerra is a member of the committee of Italian Strategic Fund (Fondo Strategico Italiano S.p.A.),[14] a member of boards of Amplifon S.p.A.[15] and Ariston Thermo S.p.A. , and a shareholder of online newspaper Linkiesta.[16] He also sits on the boards of directors of Bocconi university and Save the Children Italia Onlus.[17] Over the years he has held the position of director on the boards of Parmalat S.p.A., Banca Nazionale del Lavoro[18] and Dea Capital S.p.A.[19] In the February 2014, when Matteo Renzi's government was being formed, some Italian media suggested his possible involvement in the government team,[20] this possibility denied by Guerra himself.[21]
Education[edit]
Andrea Guerra graduated cum laude in business at the Sapienza University of Rome in 1989.
Private life[edit]
Andrea Guerra is married and has three children.

  Product description:
  Portrait of a young Italian tree surgeon and doctor.  Andrea lives near Loiano (Bologna area of Italy) in the Apennine mountains.  He has a strong, handsome, and intelligent face.  Here is an image of a political person who has not been fooled or hoodwinked by the mass media or appeals to nationalist propaganda. He is very much his own man. He was a good friend and companion, along with his wife Polly, when Angela and I lived in that area for most of the summer.

 I have a strong interest in the "poetica del vero" schools of painting, mostly derived from Italian influences.

Andrea Guerra's score for the feel-good drama The Pursuit of Happyness so closely resembles Scottish composer Rolfe Kent's efforts for the earlier About Schmidt that one can only assume the film was tempo-tracked to Kent's quirky, endearing melodies, leaving Guerra little choice but to ape his predecessor. From within these claustrophobically narrow creative confines, Guerra nevertheless manages to generate a few original themes, employing unobtrusive piano and guitar to forge a sweetly romantic and thoughtful approach in lockstep with the remainder of the score -- indeed, what's appalling about The Pursuit of Happyness has nothing to do with the quality of the music and everything to do with a "me too" Hollywood mentality that renders even the most innovative ideas stale and predictable via sheer repetition. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi

Yet somehow it stars Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford. Italian born composer Andrea Guerra did the score. I was first introduced to his work with some of the amazing stuff he composed for Hotel Rwanda alongside Rupert Gregson-Williams.With Extraordinary Measures Guerra takes a non intrusive approach. Some of the music borders saccharine and cliche, but there are a few tracks that call back to that style I heard and loved in Hotel Rwanda. This is a piano and strings score that relies on the arrangements. He utilizes electronics occasionally more for percussion and to add some tension and conflict to the sound. Tracks like "Her Eyes", "The Lake", "Breakdown" and "On The Road" shine through though because they find a way to step apart from the formulaic material of the film.The sugar coated part of the score is melodramatic and just rushes in forced emotions. Do not get put off by the first track, which is incredibly cheesy. There is heart and real emotion in this score. It just requires a little digging to get the sweet candy shell off. This score is an honest attempt at lightweight emotional scoring for a PG family drama. The music just never excels, and while there are some genuine cues of real emotion there is also some melodramatic stuff we have to cut through to get to it. Guerra is another recent foreign composer who is starting to get more work in Hollywood and I can't wait to hear more from him.Read more0Comment|
