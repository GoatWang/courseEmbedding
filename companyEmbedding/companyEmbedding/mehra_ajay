Salient Partners LP


                  Salient Partners employs a highly-diversified, multi-asset class investment approach that combined traditional and alternative asset classes and is modeled on the approach used by the managers of well-known endowments. The firm invests globally, allocating assets across multiple asset classes. Their investment products integrate traditional asset classes, such as stocks, bonds and cash, with alternative investments. Salient Partners focuses on 2 main lines of business: (1) trust/advisory and (2) asset management.Through Salient Trust Co., the firm manages assets for institutions and high net-worth individuals on a discretionary basis. In this regard, they provide the following services: (1) asset allocation (2) manager selection (3) rebalancing and (4) reporting. Their philosophy is to manage assets for clients in the same manner as a large, sophisticated institution would manage its own assets. They employ the principals of Modern Portfolio Theory and mean reversion analysis to allocate assets, which the firm believes is the principal driver of investment returns. Salient's tactical asset allocation model is updated daily and focuses on the relative expense/value of asset classes to make asset allocation decisions based on a series of metrics believed to be predictive of future returns. Their asset allocation model is proprietary and continuously improved. While our model is based on quantitative analysis, Salient reviews allocations derived from the model and makes changes to the allocations based on their experience and judgment. Once they have established asset allocation, Salient attempts to populate a portfolio with best-in-class investments, whether in-house or provided by third parties. The firm manages about half of each client's portfolio in-house.Salient's asset management capabilities are broad, encompassing both traditional and alternative asset classes. To provide additional expertise and experience, when developing an investment product, the firm may enter into a joint venture with a manager with experience in the field in question. Salient's product base includes: (1) Large-Cap Stocks (2) MLPs (3) REITS (4) Alternative Investments and (5) Socially Conscious Investing.Salient's Core Large-Cap Equity strategy seeks to achieve capital appreciation by constructing traditional, diversified portfolios of large-cap domestic stocks and ADRs, with the secondary objective of providing income.  The firm employs top-down, growth-oriented investment approach. Portfolios typically include 25 to 40 positions across the 10 major economic sectors. Salient focuses on established companies and their expected performance over a2 to 4 year time horizon, seeking to construct both a well-diversified portfolio and to purchase issues at a reasonable price.Salient Trust Co. manages investments in MLPs with the objective of providing investors with a current yield and the prospect of capital appreciation.Salient Partners' REIT strategy seeks to provide investors with relatively high current income and modest longer-term growth. The firm constructs separate portfolios for each client based on their unique investment objectives, current portfolio holdings, investment time horizon, income needs and risk tolerance.  Depending upon size, portfolios are populated with 15 to 25 names, all of which trade on the NYSE. In addition, all property types are represented in the REIT space and, depending upon economic conditions, certain sectors may be over- or under-weighted relative to popular REIT indices.Salient Partners provides access to several alternative investment themes including: timber, long/short equity, absolute return and diversified portfolios/actively rebalanced investments. The firm's long/short equity strategies seek to purchase undervalued securities and short-sell overvalued securities. These strategies are designed to minimize market risk by hedging full directional exposure and to profit from a change in the spread between the two securities. Salient Partners' absolute return strategies include: (1) event-driven strategies such as merger arbitrage and (2) relative value strategies such as equity market neutral, convertible arbitrage and fixed-income arbitrage. Their absolute return strategies focus on generating low volatility returns with little or no correlation to market fluctuations. The firm offers several portfolio-style solutions that consist of actively rebalanced investments made across multiple asset managers. The firm uses a variety of strategies to develop these portfolios, including a balanced portfolio of liquid investments, global/macro and endowment-style investing. These strategies are designed to preserve capital and minimize volatility with the ultimate goal of increasing long-term investment performance through the power of positive compounding.For certain pre-qualified investors with whom they have a pre-existing relationship, Salient Partners constructs portfolios which employ faith-based screens which allow investors to invest consistent with their religious values. Investment screening may include tobacco, alcohol, gaming, abortion/abortificients, egregious human rights violators and weaponry companies.

The firm employs a value-oriented investment approach that seeks to generate consistent returns with emphasis on capital preservation. Columbus Nova Partners invests through three investment vehicles: Columbus Nova Credit Investment Managers (CNCI), Columbus Nova Private Equity Partners (CNPE) and Columbus Nova Real Estate Acquisition Group (CRAG).CNPE focuses on providing value-added capital to lower middle-market businesses in traditional industries in the US and Canada that have EBITDA less than $100 million. They look for companies with consistent cash flows, solid business fundamentals and barriers to entry that compete in sectors with favorable industry trends. Investments are a minimum of $10 million. CNPE focuses on the consumer products and services, education, entertainment/leisure, media, shipping, highways, ports, energy and utilities, manufacturing and commercial and municipal construction sectors. They do not invest in the technology, biotechnology, automotive or airline industries. CRAG invests in corporate real estate, either though sale-leaseback or mortgage transactions. CNCI specializes in leveraged loan credit products.
