At City of London, we focus not on gathering assets, but on building products that reflect our expertise. Initially, and for many years since the firm was founded, that expertise was very specific to closed-end funds (CEF) which offered emerging markets exposure. This was subsequently complemented by applying our unrivalled knowledge of closed-end funds around the world to the development of a Frontier Markets CEF strategy, Developed Markets CEF strategy, a Global Tactical Asset Allocation CEF strategy, as well as a Tactical Income CEF strategy using the same investment process. So today, while we remain both proud and protective of our "boutique" status, we offer a range of products which are defined by the twin pillars of our expertise: emerging markets and closed-end funds.  Read more »

Il contenuto del Sito si propone esclusivamente di informare gli investitori, i potenziali investitori nonché i loro consulenti finanziari circa gli investimenti nei Comparti della WMUF.
Il Sito non si propone tuttavia di fornire consulenza specifica in materia di investimento in strumenti finanziari, né, a scopo non esaustivo, consigli di investimento, finanziari, legali, contabili o fiscali o raccomandazioni circa l'idoneità dei Comparti della WMUF in relazione alle specifiche esigenze dei vari investitori. I potenziali investitori che desiderano consigli di investimento sono invitati a rivolgersi al proprio intermediario o consulente finanziario di fiducia. Si raccomanda agli interessati di ottenere, prima di effettuare qualsiasi investimento, consulenza adeguata sulla normativa di settore, imposizione fiscale e qualsiasi altra disposizione di legge ad essi eventualmente applicabile. WMUF non assume alcuna responsabilità per quanto riguarda le eventuali decisioni di investimento adottate e le conseguenze o i risultati di tali investimenti, che pertanto ricadranno esclusivamente sull'investitore.
Accedendo al Sito l'utente riconosce e accetta che il contenuto del Sito non può essere considerato un'informativa esauriente sui Comparti della WMUF e non sostituisce in alcun modo le informazioni contenute nella Documentazione di Offerta.

Disposizioni di carattere generale
Gli investimenti nei Comparti della WMUF potrebbero non essere adatti a tutti gli investitori e WMUF non ne garantisce il rendimento.

I rendimenti sono riportati al netto delle commissioni di gestione e al lordo della ritenuta fiscale. Il reddito generato dagli investimenti può essere soggetto a oscillazioni e non è garantito, pertanto i potenziali investitori potrebbero non recuperare l'intero capitale investito. Si fa presente che le aliquote e le esenzioni fiscali possono variare e che le fluttuazioni dei tassi di interesse possono influire sul valore degli investimenti con esposizione in valuta estera.

Emerging Markets Quarterly Outlook
Belated Honeymoon for Emerging Markets
Brimming with optimism, markets have risen to new record highs as the financial crisis recedes in memory, cyclical indicators increasingly point to a gathering global recovery and the Trump administration has proven unable/unwilling to make good on its most disruptive campaign promises. This has particularly benefitted emerging market (EM) equities, which enjoyed the additional boost of strengthening exchange rates as the dollar weakened during Q1. Similarly, sovereign bond issuance by EMs hit an all-time quarterly record in the first quarter, while flows of portfolio capital into EM stocks have also been strong. Whereas investors withdrew nearly $30bn from EM stocks and bonds in November 2016, the month of Donald Trump’s election victory, outflows slowed to a mere $1.2 bn in December and reversed to the tune of an estimated $12 bn in January.
To be sure, signs of improvement abound, not only in the context of the dismal recent years. True, Russia and Brazil are merely exiting a painful recession and remain hostage to the vagaries of local politics and global commodity prices. Political flashpoints also exist from Turkey to South Africa to Thailand. But robust economic readings elsewhere, be it in South Korea or Mexico, suggest that the broader growth downtrend of the past years may be about to be broken. Some countries, such as India and Indonesia, also enjoy large domestic economies and ambitious economic reform programs. And finally, while EM inflation is ebbing away, global trade is witnessing its fastest growth rate in seven years.
But what of the threat of rising US rates? Their impact is likely to be less damaging than in past episodes. First, the tightening cycle only responds to (and in fact, deliberately lags) the recovery of the US economy. Second, it is the most telegraphed series of rate increases in Fed history, and they are set to be both small and slow. The Fed continues to see the equilibrium real rate as near zero and has not changed its view of the terminal rate of 3.0%. Third, at the same time China’s economy is stabilising and delivering a positive growth impulse to the global economy. And finally, as pointed out previously, emerging markets possess much improved national balance sheets and more competitive exchange rates compared to previous episodes of rising US rates.
But is buying into risk at this stage in the market cycle picking up pennies in front of a steamroller? Potentially. The shock value of last year’s two seminal events – the ‘Brexit’ vote on June 23rd and Donald Trump’s election on November 8th – may have faded, but the long term repercussions of these events have yet to make themselves felt. At a minimum, the increasing scepticism about trade, financial integration and international cooperation amongst policymakers does not warrant market volatility levels near historic lows and stock markets near historic highs. While low volatility can partly be explained by record low bond yields which support appetite for alternative assets, the long term consequences of these political risks appear insufficiently discounted. While the old adage holds that ‘in the long term we are all dead’, any upsurge in US trade protectionism, in particular with respect to China, has the potential to severely disrupt appetite for EM assets.
Market Strategy
Against this backdrop, our approach remains to acknowledge both the fundamental and cyclical improvements in emerging markets, but to stay wary of current market exuberance, which relies excessively on the notion of ‘Trumpflation’. In other words, while the MSCI EM outperformed the MSCI World by a strong 4.9% in Q1, we do not indiscriminately ramp up risk exposure in our allocation. Instead, we add risk where we see value and make some other adjustments.
Specifically, we have upgraded Mexico from underweight to neutral given both the proactive stance of Banxico in stemming peso weakness and rising inflation expectations and the receding threat of a wholesale dismantling of NAFTA by the US. We upgraded Korea to overweight as the ouster of President Park opened the door to a more certain and promising outlook, while valuations remain attractive. Similarly, we moved Taiwan and Malaysia from neutral to overweight, the former on the basis of an uptick in external demand and the latter on the basis of a recovering domestic outlook.
By contrast, after a spectacular but short-lived run, we downgrade Russia from overweight to neutral as there has yet been little fundamental improvement, political tensions, both domestic and international, are intensifying again and valuations have become unattractive.

Company Overview
Expertise
At City of London, we focus not on gathering assets, but on building products that reflect our expertise. Initially, and for many years since the firm was founded, that expertise was very specific to closed-end funds (CEF) which offered emerging markets exposure. This was subsequently complemented by applying our unrivalled knowledge of closed-end funds around the world to the development of a Frontier Emerging Markets CEF strategy, Developed Markets CEF strategy, a Global Tactical Asset Allocation CEF strategy, as well as a Tactical Income CEF strategy using the same investment process.  So today, while we remain both proud and protective of our "boutique" status, we offer a range of products which are defined by the twin pillars of our expertise: emerging markets and closed-end funds.
Process
We have always striven to develop and nurture an investment process which does not rely on 'star' fund managers, but rather upon a series of analytical procedures that can produce repeatable and sustainable first or second quartile performance versus our peers. Our process employs an array of proprietary tools for analysing and identifying value. These quantitative tools supplement both macroeconomic analysis and a trading expertise that has been developed over a period of over 25 years. Our aim is to deliver consistent relative outperformance combined with low volatility relative to the applicable emerging markets benchmarks, via taking advantage of discount anomalies in closed-end funds.
Client Service
Our clients are our business. If performance is our first priority, then client service is a close second. We understand that a "one size fits all" approach is not appropriate. Our aim is to be open and accessible to each and every client, and while we have a designated client service team we also expect and encourage our institutional clients to enjoy direct contact with fund managers and other key individuals within the investment management team. We acknowledge that our industry has faced some difficult issues in recent times, both with respect to the opaque practices of a few, and with respect to volatile market conditions. We are, and always have been, an open book to our clients. While we would never seek to impose, we try to anticipate the concerns of our clients, and with that in mind we offer personal visits by our senior investment officers to all of our institutional clients and achieve a significant take up rate. We believe that our focus on client service is a key driver of our long term client retention.

Overview
City of London Investment Group PLC
City of London Investment Group PLC is an established asset management group which has built its reputation, with an institutional client focus, by specialising in emerging market closed-end fund investment.  In recent years the Group has by way of diversification successfully added natural resource and developed market strategies to its product range. City of London operates its business from offices in London, Philadelphia, Singapore, Dubai and Seattle.
CoL Diversification
Closed-end Funds - The Original Expertise
A closed-end fund (or an investment trust or company)
is one with a fixed number of shares outstanding, and
one which does not redeem shares in the way an
open-ended one (such as a mutual fund or unit trust)
does. The price of a share in a publicly traded closed-end
fund is determined entirely by supply and demand,
so shares can either trade below their net asset value
("at a discount") or above it ("at a premium"). It is this
characteristic that we seek to exploit, buying those
shares we consider cheap, generally at what we believe
to be an unjustifiable discount, and selling those we
consider expensive, those at an unwarranted small
discount or at a premium.
Emerging Markets - The First Application of Our Expertise
Emerging Markets as a description of young high growth
economies first appeared in 1981 when only six such markets
(Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand) could be accessed by foreign investors. Today there
are almost 60, including the 'frontier' markets that are at
earlier stages of development, with the largest being the socalled
BRIC's economies – those of Brazil, Russia, India and
China. City of London realised early on that institutional
investors were struggling to access these markets in a
professionally managed, risk-diversified way and that a
product focused on the closed-end funds run by specialist
managers could hold great appeal.
Tactical Income CEF Strategy - For US Taxable Investors
The Tactical Income Closed-End Fund Strategy seeks to provide a high-level of after-tax total return for US taxable investors. Our multi-sector tactical asset allocation approach results in a cross-asset diversified income stream that is tax–advantaged. We believe that a customizable, multi-asset class approach provides the greatest flexibility to exploit closed-end fund opportunities. We specialize in identifying and capitalizing on discount movements and pricing anomalies to provide above average, long-term outperformance versus the appropriate index whilst seeking to manage exposure to realized short term capital gains.
Global Tactical Asset Allocation CEF Strategy - A "go-anywhere" Approach
The Global Tactical Asset Allocation Closed-End Fund Strategy seeks to provide long-term capital growth via a value-driven, “go-anywhere” approach. We believe that a customizable, global multi-asset class approach provides the greatest flexibility to exploit closed-end fund opportunities for non-taxable investors. We specialize in identifying and capitalizing on closed-end fund pricing anomalies across the world to provide above average, long-term outperformance versus an appropriate index, with differentiated alpha capture from CEF discounts.

Company Overview
Expertise
At City of London, we focus not on gathering assets, but on building products that reflect our expertise. Initially, and for many years since the firm was founded, that expertise was very specific to closed-end funds (CEF) which offered emerging markets exposure. This was subsequently complemented by applying our unrivalled knowledge of closed-end funds around the world to the development of a Frontier Emerging Markets CEF strategy, Developed Markets CEF strategy, a Global Tactical Asset Allocation CEF strategy, as well as a Tactical Income CEF strategy using the same investment process.  So today, while we remain both proud and protective of our "boutique" status, we offer a range of products which are defined by the twin pillars of our expertise: emerging markets and closed-end funds.
Process
We have always striven to develop and nurture an investment process which does not rely on 'star' fund managers, but rather upon a series of analytical procedures that can produce repeatable and sustainable first or second quartile performance versus our peers. Our process employs an array of proprietary tools for analysing and identifying value. These quantitative tools supplement both macroeconomic analysis and a trading expertise that has been developed over a period of over 25 years. Our aim is to deliver consistent relative outperformance combined with low volatility relative to the applicable emerging markets benchmarks, via taking advantage of discount anomalies in closed-end funds.
Client Service
Our clients are our business. If performance is our first priority, then client service is a close second. We understand that a "one size fits all" approach is not appropriate. Our aim is to be open and accessible to each and every client, and while we have a designated client service team we also expect and encourage our institutional clients to enjoy direct contact with fund managers and other key individuals within the investment management team. We acknowledge that our industry has faced some difficult issues in recent times, both with respect to the opaque practices of a few, and with respect to volatile market conditions. We are, and always have been, an open book to our clients. While we would never seek to impose, we try to anticipate the concerns of our clients, and with that in mind we offer personal visits by our senior investment officers to all of our institutional clients and achieve a significant take up rate. We believe that our focus on client service is a key driver of our long term client retention.

This is City of London Group plc


City of London Group plc (COLG) is a closed-ended investment company, investing in financial services businesses which provide finance to the SME and professional services sectors. It does this by financing trade and securing specialist funding throughout the supply chain to help fuel growth in these sectors, as major national and foreign banks limit new lending to those borrowers. COLG seeks to identify and exploit product niches and business models in these sectors where they are supported by strong day to day management teams, providing initial equity, working capital and seed funding for those teams.

COLG has developed specialist financing platforms, pledging significant seed funds to Credit Asset Management Limited, a provider of asset backed finance for the SME sector and commercial loans predominantly to professional practice firms, and Trade Finance Partners Limited, a trade finance provider to the SME market.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

1 You have choices for what to do with your employer sponsored retirement plan. Depending on your financial circumstances, needs and goals, you may choose to roll over to an IRA or convert to a Roth, roll over to an employer sponsored plan from a prior employer to an employer sponsored plan at your new employer, take a distribution or leave the account where it is. Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care.
