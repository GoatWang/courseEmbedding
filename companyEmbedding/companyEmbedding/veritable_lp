We Changed Everything
Prior to 1986 we were compensated for our advice by doing transactions on behalf of clients. With the encouragement of a dozen clients we formed a new company and radically changed our business model and the fundamental relationship between ourselves and our clients. Our mission for the past 30 years has been to provide unbiased, comprehensive investment advice based on client advocacy, not salesmanship:

Veritable client portfolios don’t necessarily look like everyone else’s.
Veritable has a long history of investing in select ideas and structures early in their lifecycles. Where solutions do not already exist, we have no qualms about creating them and we are not afraid to be different.

We use our firm’s scale and experience to negotiate improved investment terms, increase transparency, and enhance safety.
In the run up to the most recent financial crisis, when most hedge fund assets were locked up behind limited partnership structures, Veritable used the unusual terms it had negotiated with outside managers to move more than $500 million of hedge fund capital from prime brokerage accounts to the safety of custody accounts in U.S. money center banks.




Past performance does not necessarily 
 predict future results.
We believe that great processes are more important to long term investment success than how well an investment or manager has performed (or who else is investing).  We believe that tremendous context and a deep understanding of how people make investment decisions is the keystone to successful investing.




























We are concerned that many families do not know how their investments are truly performing.
We strive to provide clear reporting and communication as a part of the Veritable experience. We developed an after-tax reporting system over 20 years ago as a way to better inform us and our clients about portfolio performance and suitable tactics.



 

We are Not Afraid to Change Everything
At Veritable we are not interested in emulating other investment firms.  We want to use our experience and resources to lead the rest of the wealth management industry.




Veritable works with families across the United States from offices in suburban Philadelphia and San Francisco.

Meet Our Team.
In November of 1986 we were a one-employee firm. I answered the phones, wrote investment policies, made investments, prepared reports and met with the firm’s ten intrepid clients. Those clients introduced me to their friends and whenever I had a little room in our budget, I went looking for more help, always focusing my search on some skill set we otherwise lacked. Today I have the privilege of working with more than 80 energetic people who represent a broad array of specialized expertise. The firm’s leadership, which I present below, has an average tenure of over 13 years at Veritable.

The Right People
Without question, our most valuable asset is our people. We have consistently recruited talented professionals who also bring a specialized skill or life experiences to our business. Approximately half of our firm has earned advanced degrees and designations. We have been fortunate to have very little turnover of senior professionals during the past nearly three decades.

The Client Experience
As a Veritable client, your needs come first. We constantly strive to see the investment process through your eyes. As partners and colleagues, we set exacting standards for ourselves. Veritable’s spirit of innovation and entrepreneurial thinking has served our clients for decades with thoughtful advice and practical wisdom.
It is this deep-seated commitment to you that is unparalleled in the industry.








Consult



Our relationship with you is comprehensive.


We are active participants in every dimension of your financial life, whether by providing advice on structuring a business transaction;  employing tax optimization strategies; acting as a sounding board for estate planning; or tailoring a plan to make effective gifts to charity. Whatever the issue, we respond creatively and resourcefully with analysis, thoughtful judgment, and follow-through.








Invest



At our core, we are investors. Our goal is to maximize your after-tax returns with an acceptable level of risk. After careful study of your unique situation, we produce a tailored investment plan that serves as a roadmap for our consulting relationship.


The process begins with a detailed interview. We synthesize this information with empirical analyses of your unique tax, estate planning, business, and personal circumstances to establish a balance of income and growth that will fit your needs both now and in the future. We use third-party funds, managers and solutions to fulfill the growth aspects of the investment plan.
Once you have had a chance to review and approve this investment plan, we carefully implement it. Our internal portfolio managers, analysts and traders are talented investors, constantly searching for the right structure, solution or third-party managers to blend together within your portfolio. We are dedicated to thoughtfully managing your costs related to transactions, taxes, and third party fees.
Finally, we make revisions to the investment plans as necessary. The most successful public market investors understand that investment policy and asset allocation must be dynamic. It is not a “set it and forget it” proposition. Circumstances change and the most successful investment plans must be flexible.








Curate



In the United States, there are more than 5,000 public companies traded on the major exchanges and more than 14,000 mutual funds. Layer on hedge funds, private equity opportunities, private real estate deals and other specialty investments, and the list of investment options is truly enormous.


At Veritable, we are determined to be discriminating buyers and allocators of capital. We have always been solution agnostic and open, combining both active and passive investment strategies within client portfolios.
When allocating capital to domestic fixed income and certain index replication strategies, we maintain a trading desk that allows us to provide you with tailored, total-return strategies while avoiding the additional fees and costs of an external manager.
When and where active management is desirable, we engage in a rigorous process of research and due diligence in an effort to identify money managers around the world. Of the more than 10,000 money managers we’ve met and interviewed over the last 25 years, we have employed less than 100.








Discuss



We believe that clear and open written and spoken communication is paramount to successfully collaborating with our clients.


Through frequent meetings and updates, we build a close working relationship that will establish expectations, reduce anxiety, and outline a clear path to addressing your financial goals. We believe that this ultimately results in better long-term investment performance. Important inflection points in our process include policy development; the transmission of new investment opportunities; providing market commentary; reflecting important changes or issues regarding tax or estate planning topics; and routine meetings to review results and discuss new ideas.








Protect



The modern investment landscape presents families with a complex collection of risks.


As fiduciaries, we help clients to navigate an ever-changing financial landscape. Decades of experience provides us with a unique perspective on how best to protect you.
With over $12 billion of capital under management and an established reputation among outside money managers as a thoughtful, long-term investor, we are able to negotiate better terms such as full transparency, separate accounts and reduced fees.








Report



It is your right to know the truth about your investment performance – net of taxes and fees.


In good times and bad, a Veritable client has access to both pre-tax and after-tax returns vs. benchmarks for: 1) their overall portfolio 2) each asset class and 3) for individual investments and strategies.  Our reporting allows you to measure the value of our advice and investment acumen. Do your bank and brokerage statements provide the same?







Experience Veritable
Veritable is a national firm serving families across the United States with offices in suburban Philadelphia and San Francisco. Contact us to discuss how Veritable might provide unique advice to help your own family.

A Unique Opportunity

Archean Capital Partners (Archean) is a joint venture between Veritable, L.P. and Moelis Asset Management LP.  Archean is a private market investment platform that seeks to deploy capital with highly qualified portfolio managers who are interested in starting their own firms.  Archean is focused on opportunities in such specialties as buyout, growth, restructuring/turnaround, direct lending, and real estate.


Veritable’s primary objective with regard to Archean is to generate enhanced returns for its clients through careful fund manager selection and thoughtful investment structuring.







“Investments by Archean will give managers the certainty of a large, initial source of capital for an early first close.” 


Archean is able to provide portfolio managers with the initial investment capital, advice and infrastructure necessary to launch new, independent firms.  Archean’s involvement should also enhance the manager’s ability to secure additional capital commitments from other investors.
The complexities of researching and successfully investing with emergent private market firms require special skills. Veritable has made dozens of substantial investments with a variety of early-stage alternative strategy managers over the past two decades.  We believe this experience contributes to our firm’s deep knowledge and extensive context as it relates to alternative market investing.

AMG Wealth Partners Announces Investment in VeritableBOSTON and PALM BEACH, Fla., March 20, 2012 - AMG Wealth Partners, LP, a subsidiary of Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE: AMG), has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an equity interest in Veritable, LP. After the closing of the transaction and consistent with AMG’s investment approach, Veritable’s management and employees will hold a significant equity interest in the business and continue to direct its day-to-day operations.
Veritable, a leading wealth management firm, manages over $10 billion across nearly 200 ultra-high-net-worth families. A pioneer in open-architecture wealth advisory services, Veritable provides comprehensive, objective and tax-sensitive investment consultation through an approach customized for each client’s specific needs. Founded in 1986 by Chief Executive Officer Michael Stolper, the firm is based in Newtown Square, Pa., and has 84 employees, including 36 investment advisory and 12 research professionals.
“We are very pleased to partner with Veritable, a fast-growing and widely recognized leader among independent wealth management firms,” stated Sean M. Healey, AMG’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Over the next decade, the wealth management industry will benefit from favorable demographic trends, which will result in a significant increase in the number of high-net-worth individuals and drive growing demand for institutional-quality wealth advisory firms. As one of the most highly regarded and successful firms in the industry, Veritable is well positioned to continue to capitalize on this opportunity. Veritable’s decision to join AMG Wealth Partners underscores the strength of our investment model and our reputation as the partner of choice for boutique firms.”
John W. Copeland, President of AMG Wealth Partner, added, “Veritable is an outstanding firm with a 25-year track record of providing unbiased, comprehensive advice and industry-leading investment performance to wealthy families. We are impressed with Veritable’s entrepreneurial culture, the tremendous depth of talent across the organization and the tailored approach to each individual client.”
“We are excited to join AMG Wealth Partners as we believe their unique approach serves the best interests of our clients, partners and employees,” said Mr. Stolper. “Veritable’s success is based on our firm’s culture, objectivity and commitment to client service, and our partnership with AMG ensures the preservation of these core principles – now and for future generations.” 
Upon completion of the transaction, AMG Wealth Partners will own an equity interest in Veritable, and a broad group of Veritable’s senior professionals, who have made long-term commitments to the firm, will continue to hold a significant equity interest. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

AMG’s strategy is to generate growth through the internal growth of existing Affiliates, as well as through investments in new Affiliates. In addition, AMG provides centralized assistance to its Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations.
AMG Wealth Partners employs the essential elements of AMG’s proven partnership model, with an approach tailored to meet the unique attributes and needs of independent wealth advisory firms.

Certain matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those projected in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including changes in the securities or financial markets or in general economic conditions, the availability of equity and debt financing, competition for acquisitions of interests in investment management firms, the ability to close pending investments, the investment performance of our Affiliates and their ability to effectively market their investment strategies, and other risks detailed from time to time in AMG’s filings with the SEC. Reference is hereby made to the “Risk Factors” set forth in AMG’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
AMG routinely posts information that may be significant for investors in the Investor Information section of its website, and encourages investors to consult that section regularly. For additional information, please visit www.amg.com.
