SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION
[Release No. 34–80891; File No. SR–
NASDAQ–2017–054]

June 8, 2017.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(‘‘Act’’),1 and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,2
notice is hereby given that on May 26,
2017, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC
(‘‘Nasdaq’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission
(‘‘SEC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed
rule change as described in Items I, II,
and III below, which Items have been
prepared by the Exchange. The
Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule
change from interested persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement of the Terms of Substance of
the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange proposes to merge the
OpenView depth-of-book product into
TotalView, and to amend the
Exchange’s fees at Rules 7023 and 7026
to reflect the merger of these two
products, as described further below.
The Exchange has designated the
proposed amendments to be operative
on August 1, 2017.
The text of the proposed rule change
is available on the Exchange’s Web site
at http://nasdaq.cchwallstreet.com, at
the principal office of the Exchange, and
at the Commission’s Public Reference
Room.

proposed rule change. The text of these
statements may be examined at the
places specified in Item IV below. The
Exchange has prepared summaries, set
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of
the most significant aspects of such
statements.
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement of the Purpose of, and the
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule
Change
1. Purpose
The purpose of the proposed rule
change is to amend the Exchange’s fees
at Rules 7023 and 7026 to merge the
OpenView depth-of-book product into
TotalView.
TotalView and OpenView
TotalView, the Exchange’s complete
depth data feed product for Nasdaqlisted securities, provides every eligible
order at every price level for all Nasdaq
members, as well as Net Order
Imbalance information.3 OpenView—
almost universally purchased in
conjunction with Nasdaq’s other depthof-book products, TotalView and Level
2 4—provides the same information as
TotalView for stocks listed on other
exchanges.
TotalView and OpenView may be
purchased through monthly
subscription fees or enterprise license
fees. Different fee structures apply if
purchasers opt to view TotalView or
OpenView using an Enhanced Display
Solution (‘‘EDS’’) or utilize the data in
a non-display fashion using a Managed
Data Solution (‘‘MDS’’). The current fees
associated with TotalView and
OpenView that will be affected by the
proposed changes, set forth in Rules
7023 and 7026, are as follows:
1. Per Subscriber Fees. Monthly NonProfessional per Subscriber fees are $14
for TotalView,5 and $1 for OpenView.6
Monthly Professional Subscriber fees
are $70 for TotalView,7 and $6 for
OpenView.8
2. Professional Subscriber Fees for
Non-Display Usage. The professional
Subscriber fees for Non-Display Usage
3 Net Order Imbalance information provides data
relating to buy and sell interest at the open and
close of the trading day, in the context of an Initial
Public Offering, and after a trading halt.
4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 79863
(January 23, 2017) 82 FR 8632 (January 27, 2017)

will be retired as a separate product).

based upon direct access set forth in
Rule 7023(b)(4) allow for the purchase
of all depth-of-book products, including
TotalView, Level 2 and OpenView, for
one fee.9
3. Enterprise License Fees. The
enterprises [sic] license fees set forth in
Nasdaq Rules 7023(c)(1) and (c)(2) allow
for the purchase of TotalView and
OpenView, and the enterprise license
fees at 7023(c)(3) allow for the purchase
of all three depth-of-book products,
including TotalView, Level 2 and
OpenView, under the same fee
structure.10
4. Per Subscriber Fees for Enhanced
Display Solutions. The monthly fee for
Professional Subscribers using EDS
under Rule 7026(a)(1)(B) is $74 for
TotalView and Level 2 and $6 for
OpenView. Non-Professional
Subscribers of EDS pay the applicable
TotalView, Level 2 or OpenView rates.11
5. Enhanced Display Solution
Enterprise License. The EDS enterprise
license set forth in Rule 7026(a)(1)(C)
allows TotalView and Level 2 to be
distributed to an unlimited number of
Professional Subscribers for $70, and
OpenView for $6.
6. Managed Data Solutions. Rule
7026(b) sets forth a fee structure for
MDS that applies the same fees for the
distribution of TotalView, Level 2 and
OpenView.

Proposed Changes
The Exchange proposes to amend the
fees at Rules 7023 and 7026 to merge
OpenView into TotalView. In substance,
the Exchange will combine all fees for
TotalView and OpenView into a single
sum, without increasing the total price
of the two products, and make a number
of conforming changes to delete specific
references to OpenView. The specific
fee changes to Rules 7023 and 7026 are
as follows:
1. Per Subscriber Fees. Monthly NonProfessional per Subscriber fees will be
changed from $14 for TotalView 12 and
9 The Rule 7023(b)(4) fees are based on the
number of Subscribers; the fee structure allows a
Subscriber to obtain any combination of TotalView,
Level 2 and OpenView, or all three products, for the
same per Subscriber fee.
10 The enterprise license fees set forth in Rules
7023(c)(1) and 7023(c)(2) are comprised of two
components: An enterprise license fee and perSubscriber monthly fees. A Distributor may obtain
any combination of TotalView, Level 2 and
OpenView, or all three products, for the same
enterprise license and per-Subscriber monthly fees
under Rules 7023(c)(1) and (c)(2). The fee structure
set forth in Rule 7023(c)(3) is an enterprise license
fee without per-Subscriber monthly fees. A
Distributor may obtain any combination of
TotalView, Level 2 and OpenView, or all three
products, for the enterprise license fee set forth in
Rule 7023(c)(3).

$1 for OpenView 13 to $15 for
TotalView, which will be redefined in
current Rule 7023(a)(1)(C) to include
OpenView data. Monthly Professional
Subscriber fees will be changed from
$70 for TotalView 14 and $6 for
OpenView 15 to $76 for TotalView,
which will include OpenView data.
2. Professional Subscriber Fees for
Non-Display Usage. There will be no
substantive change to the Professional
Subscriber fees for Non-Display Usage
set forth in Nasdaq Rule 7023(b)(4),
which already allows for the purchase
of all three depth-of-book products,
including OpenView, TotalView and
Level 2, under the same fee structure.
Explicit references to OpenView will be
deleted as a technical, conforming
change.
3. Enterprise License Fees. There will
be no substantive change to the
enterprises [sic] license fees set forth in
Nasdaq Rules 7023(c)(1), (c)(2) and
(c)(3), which already allow for the
purchase of depth-of-book products,
including OpenView and TotalView,16
for the same fee. Explicit references to
OpenView will be deleted as a
technical, conforming change.
4. Per Subscriber Fees for Enhanced
Display Solutions. The monthly fee for
Professional Subscribers using EDS will
be changed from $74 for TotalView and
Level 2 and $6 for OpenView 17 to $80
for TotalView, which will include all
OpenView data, and Level 2. NonProfessional Subscribers of EDS will
continue to pay at the applicable
TotalView or Level 2 rates.18 Explicit
references to OpenView will be deleted
as a technical, conforming change.
5. Enhanced Display Solution
Enterprise License. The monthly
professional subscriber fee for
purchasers of an enterprise license with
EDS will be changed from $70 for
TotalView and Level 2 and $6 for
OpenView 19 to $76 for TotalView,
which will include all OpenView data,
and Level 2.
6. Managed Data Solutions. There
will be no substantive change to the fee
structure for MDS set forth in Rule
7026(b), which already allows for the
distribution of all three depth-of-book
products, including OpenView,
TotalView and Level 2, under the same
fee structure. Explicit references to

OpenView will be deleted as a
technical, conforming change.
In addition to all of these changes, the
definition of OpenView will be removed
from the current Rule book at Rule
7023(a)(1)(B), and the data provided in
OpenView will be added to the
definition of TotalView currently in
Rule 7023(a)(1)(C), which will be redesignated as Rule 7023(a)(1)(B).
The proposed rule change will lower
administrative costs and simplify the
purchase of depth-of-book products,
with no impact on fees for most
customers. Almost all purchasers of
depth products already purchase
OpenView in conjunction with
TotalView or Level 2, and prices will
not change for these customers. Most of
the limited number of customers
purchasing TotalView or OpenView
alone are in the process of phasing out
the practice, and will not be materially
affected by the proposed change.
Depth-of-book customers that
purchase TotalView and OpenView
together have to manage separate
reporting, billing and approvals for two
products that they utilize as a single
product. The resulting administrative
burden applies to four separate
categories of fees: (i) Non-Professional
per Subscriber fees for TotalView 20 and
OpenView; 21 (ii) Professional
Subscriber fees for TotalView 22 and
OpenView; 23 (iii) monthly fees for
Professional and Non-Professional
Subscribers using EDS; 24 and (iv)
monthly subscriber fees for purchasers
of an EDS enterprise license.25 The
proposed change will lessen the
administrative burden on these
customers—representing the bulk of
depth-of-book purchasers—while
leaving fees and product quality
unaffected.
Nasdaq has engaged in discussions
with Distributors that purchase
OpenView without TotalView or Level
2—or TotalView or Level 2 without
OpenView—and determined that this
practice is being phased out. This
practice had its origins before Nasdaq
became an Exchange, when Nasdaq did
not trade a significant number of
securities listed on other exchanges.
Now, Nasdaq routinely trades the
securities of other exchanges, and the
rationale for this practice is obsolete. As
such, Nasdaq does not expect merging
OpenView into TotalView to have a
long-term impact on customers that are

already in the process of deciding
whether to purchase either both
products, or neither, because of
fundamental changes in the economic
environment. The proposed fee
change—which leaves the total cost of
OpenView and TotalView unchanged—
is unlikely to alter that decision.
No transition time is needed to merge
OpenView into TotalView—they are
already offered in a compatible formats
[sic] and Distributors require no time to
modify their systems to accommodate
the change.
The proposed fees are optional in that
they apply only to firms that elect to
purchase these products. The proposed
changes do not impact the cost of any
other Nasdaq product.

2. Statutory Basis
The Exchange believes that its
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)
of the Act,26 in general, and furthers the
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5)
of the Act,27 in particular, in that it
provides for the equitable allocation of
reasonable dues, fees and other charges
among members and issuers and other
persons using any facility, and is not
designed to permit unfair
discrimination between customers,
issuers, brokers, or dealers.
The Commission and the courts have
repeatedly expressed their preference
for competition over regulatory
intervention in determining prices,
products, and services in the securities
markets. In Regulation NMS, while
adopting a series of steps to improve the
current market model, the Commission
highlighted the importance of market
forces in determining prices and SRO
revenues and, also, recognized that
current regulation of the market system
‘‘has been remarkably successful in
promoting market competition in its
broader forms that are most important to
investors and listed companies.’’ 28
Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities
and Exchange Commission 29
(‘‘NetCoalition’’) the D.C. Circuit upheld
the Commission’s use of a market-based
approach in evaluating the fairness of
market data fees against a challenge
claiming that Congress mandated a costbased approach.30 As the court
emphasized, the Commission ‘‘intended
in Regulation NMS that ‘market forces,
rather than regulatory requirements’
play a role in determining the market

data . . . to be made available to
investors and at what cost.’’ 31
Further, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that
competition for order flow is ‘fierce.’
. . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n the U.S.
national market system, buyers and
sellers of securities, and the brokerdealers that act as their order-routing
agents, have a wide range of choices of
where to route orders for execution’;
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its
market share percentages for granted’
because ‘no exchange possesses a
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in
the execution of order flow from broker
dealers’ . . . .’’ 32
The Exchange believes that the
proposal to integrate Nasdaq TotalView
and OpenView into a single depth-ofbook product is an equitable allocation
of reasonable dues, fees or other
charges. Almost all purchasers of
Nasdaq depth-of-book products already
treat TotalView and OpenView as a
single, combined product, and the
proposed changes will reduce
administrative burden. Customers that
do not currently purchase both products
are already in the process of deciding
whether to purchase either both
products, or neither, and the proposed
fee change—which leaves the total cost
of OpenView and TotalView
unchanged—is unlikely to alter that
decision. The fees for TotalView and
OpenView, like all proprietary data fees,
are constrained by the Exchange’s need
to compete for order flow, and are
subject to competition from other
products and among broker-dealers for
customers. If Nasdaq is incorrect in its
assessment of these markets, there are
no barriers to entry for competitors with
substantially similar products.
The Exchange believes that the
proposed fee changes are an equitable
allocation because the fees
appropriately reflect the value of depthof-market data to customers as well as
industry practice in which most
customers purchase the current versions
of TotalView and OpenView
concurrently. The proposed fee changes
are not unfairly discriminatory because
the Exchange will apply the same fee to
all similarly-situated subscribers.

inter-market competition, the Exchange
notes that it operates in a highly
competitive market in which market
participants can readily favor competing
venues if they deem fee levels at a
particular venue to be excessive. In such
an environment, the Exchange must
continually adjust its fees to remain
competitive with other exchanges and
with alternative trading systems that
have been exempted from compliance
with the statutory standards applicable
to exchanges. Because competitors are
free to modify their own fees in
response, and because market
participants may readily adjust their
order routing practices, the Exchange
believes that the degree to which fee
changes in this market may impose any
burden on competition is extremely
limited.
The question of whether the prices of
depth-of-view products are constrained
by competitive forces was examined in
2016 by an Administrative Law Judge in
an application for review by the
Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association of actions taken by
Self-Regulatory Organizations.33 After a
four-day hearing and presentation of
substantial evidence, the administrative
law judge stated that ‘‘competition plays
a significant role in restraining exchange
pricing of depth-of-book products’’ 34
because ‘‘depth-of-book products from
different exchanges function as
substitutes for each other,’’ 35 and, as
such, ‘‘the threat of substitution from
depth-of-book customers constrains
their depth-of-book prices.’’ 36 In
addition, the administrative law judge
stated that ‘‘[s]hifts in order flow and
threats of shifting order flow provide a
significant competitive force in the
pricing of . . . depth-of-book data.’’ 37
As such, Nasdaq’s depth-of-book fees
are ‘‘constrained by significant
competitive forces.’’ 38 As an example of
the impact of market forces on the price
of proprietary data, the Exchange
recently lowered the Nasdaq Basic
enterprise license fee for the
distribution of certain information by
broker-dealers from $350,000 to
$100,000.39

B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that
the proposed rule change will impose
any burden on competition not
necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act. In terms of

The proposed changes will integrate
Nasdaq TotalView and OpenView into a
single depth-of-book product. If the
proposed product revisions are
unattractive to market participants, it is
likely that the Exchange will lose
market share.
Market forces constrain fees for
TotalView, like all depth-of-book
products, in three respects. First, all fees
related to TotalView are constrained by
competition among exchanges and other
entities attracting order flow. Firms
make decisions regarding depth-of-book
products and other proprietary data
based on the total cost of interacting
with the Exchange, and order flow
would be harmed by the
supracompetitive pricing of any
proprietary data product. Second, the
prices of TotalView are constrained by
the existence of substitutes that are
offered, or may be offered, by entities
that offer proprietary data. Third,
competition among Distributors for
customers will further constrain the cost
of TotalView.

mstockstill on DSK30JT082PROD with NOTICES

Competition for Order Flow
Fees related to TotalView are
constrained by competition among
exchanges and other entities seeking to
attract order flow. Order flow is the ‘‘life
blood’’ of the exchanges. Broker-dealers
currently have numerous alternative
venues for their order flow, including
self-regulatory organization (‘‘SRO’’)
markets, as well as internalizing brokerdealers (‘‘BDs’’) and various forms of
alternative trading systems (‘‘ATSs’’),
including dark pools and electronic
communication networks (‘‘ECNs’’).
Each SRO market competes to produce
transaction reports via trade executions,
and two FINRA-regulated Trade
Reporting Facilities (‘‘TRFs’’) compete
to attract internalized transaction
reports. The existence of fierce
competition for order flow implies a
high degree of price sensitivity on the
part of BDs, which may readily reduce
costs by directing orders toward the
lowest-cost trading venues.
The level of competition and
contestability in the market for order
flow is demonstrated by the numerous
examples of entrants that swiftly grew
into some of the largest electronic
trading platforms and proprietary data
producers: Archipelago, Bloomberg
Tradebook, Island, RediBook, Attain,
TracECN, and the BATS exchanges. A
proliferation of dark pools and other
ATSs operate profitably with
fragmentary shares of consolidated
market volume. For a variety of reasons,
competition from new entrants,
especially for order execution, has

VerDate Sep<11>2014

17:36 Jun 13, 2017

Jkt 241001

increased dramatically over the last
decade.
Each SRO, TRF, ATS, and BD that
competes for order flow is permitted to
produce proprietary data products.
Many currently do or have announced
plans to do so, including NYSE, NYSE
Amex, NYSE Arca, the BATS
exchanges, and IEX. This is because
Regulation NMS deregulated the market
for proprietary data. While BDs had
previously published their proprietary
data individually, Regulation NMS
encourages market data vendors and
BDs to produce proprietary products
cooperatively in a manner never before
possible. Order routers and market data
vendors can facilitate production of
proprietary data products for single or
multiple BDs. The potential sources of
proprietary products are virtually
limitless.
The markets for order flow and
proprietary data are inextricably linked:
A trading platform cannot generate
market information unless it receives
trade orders. As a result, the
competition for order flow constrains
the prices that platforms can charge for
proprietary data products. Firms make
decisions on how much and what types
of data to consume based on the total
cost of interacting with Nasdaq and
other exchanges. Data fees are but one
factor in a total platform analysis. If the
cost of the product exceeds its expected
value, the broker-dealer will choose not
to buy it. A supracompetitive increase
in the fees charged for either
transactions or proprietary data has the
potential to impair revenues from both
products. In this manner, the
competition for order flow will
constrain prices for proprietary data
products.
Substitute Products
The price of depth-of-book data is
constrained by the existence of
competition from other exchanges, such
as NYSE and the BATS exchanges,
which sell proprietary depth-of-book
data. While a small number of highly
sophisticated traders purchase depth-ofbook products from multiple exchanges,
most customers do not. Because most
customers would not pay an excessive
price for TotalView when substitute
data is available from other proprietary
sources, the Exchange is constrained in
its pricing decisions.
Competition Among Distributors
Competition among Distributors
provides another form of price
discipline for proprietary data products
to ensure that fees are equitable, fair,
reasonable and not unfairly
discriminatory. If the price of TotalView

PO 00000

Frm 00098

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

27321

were set above competitive levels,
Distributors purchasing TotalView
would be at a disadvantage relative to
their competitors, and would therefore
either purchase a substitute or forego
the product altogether.
In summary, market forces constrain
the price of depth-of-book data such as
TotalView through competition for
order flow, competition from substitute
products, and in the competition among
vendors for customers.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC; 
Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To 
Merge the OpenView Depth-of-Book Product Into TotalView

June 8, 2017.
    Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Act''),\1\ and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\ notice is hereby given that 
on May 26, 2017, The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (``Nasdaq'' or 
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the 
Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance 
of the Proposed Rule Change

    The Exchange proposes to merge the OpenView depth-of-book product 
into TotalView, and to amend the Exchange's fees at Rules 7023 and 7026 
to reflect the merger of these two products, as described further 
below. The Exchange has designated the proposed amendments to be 
operative on August 1, 2017.
    The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's 
Web site at http://nasdaq.cchwallstreet.com, at the principal office of 
the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

    In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and 
discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The 
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in 
sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

1. Purpose
    The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the Exchange's 
fees at Rules 7023 and 7026 to merge the OpenView depth-of-book product 
into TotalView.
TotalView and OpenView
    TotalView, the Exchange's complete depth data feed product for 
Nasdaq-listed securities, provides every eligible order at every price 
level for all Nasdaq members, as well as Net Order Imbalance 
information.\3\ OpenView--almost universally purchased in conjunction 
with Nasdaq's other depth-of-book products, TotalView and Level 2 \4\--
provides the same information as TotalView for stocks listed on other 
exchanges.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Net Order Imbalance information provides data relating to 
buy and sell interest at the open and close of the trading day, in 
the context of an Initial Public Offering, and after a trading halt.
    \4\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 79863 (January 23, 
2017) 82 FR 8632 (January 27, 2017) (SR-NASDAQ-2017-004) (explaining 
that Level 2 will be retired as a separate product).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TotalView and OpenView may be purchased through monthly 
subscription fees or enterprise license fees. Different fee structures 
apply if purchasers opt to view TotalView or OpenView using an Enhanced 
Display Solution (``EDS'') or utilize the data in a non-display fashion 
using a Managed Data Solution (``MDS''). The current fees associated 
with TotalView and OpenView that will be affected by the proposed 
changes, set forth in Rules 7023 and 7026, are as follows:
    1. Per Subscriber Fees. Monthly Non-Professional per Subscriber 
fees are $14 for TotalView,\5\ and $1 for OpenView.\6\ Monthly 
Professional Subscriber fees are $70 for TotalView,\7\ and $6 for 
OpenView.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Nasdaq Rule 7023(b)(2)(A).
    \6\ Nasdaq Rule 7023(b)(3)(A).
    \7\ Nasdaq Rule 7023(b)(2)(B). Fees are for Display Usage, or 
for Non-Display Usage based upon indirect access.
    \8\ Nasdaq Rule 7023(b)(3)(B). Fees are for Display Usage, or 
for Non-Display Usage based upon indirect access.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. Professional Subscriber Fees for Non-Display Usage. The 
professional Subscriber fees for Non-Display Usage

[[Page 27319]]

based upon direct access set forth in Rule 7023(b)(4) allow for the 
purchase of all depth-of-book products, including TotalView, Level 2 
and OpenView, for one fee.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ The Rule 7023(b)(4) fees are based on the number of 
Subscribers; the fee structure allows a Subscriber to obtain any 
combination of TotalView, Level 2 and OpenView, or all three 
products, for the same per Subscriber fee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Enterprise License Fees. The enterprises [sic] license fees set 
forth in Nasdaq Rules 7023(c)(1) and (c)(2) allow for the purchase of 
TotalView and OpenView, and the enterprise license fees at 7023(c)(3) 
allow for the purchase of all three depth-of-book products, including 
TotalView, Level 2 and OpenView, under the same fee structure.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ The enterprise license fees set forth in Rules 7023(c)(1) 
and 7023(c)(2) are comprised of two components: An enterprise 
license fee and per-Subscriber monthly fees. A Distributor may 
obtain any combination of TotalView, Level 2 and OpenView, or all 
three products, for the same enterprise license and per-Subscriber 
monthly fees under Rules 7023(c)(1) and (c)(2). The fee structure 
set forth in Rule 7023(c)(3) is an enterprise license fee without 
per-Subscriber monthly fees. A Distributor may obtain any 
combination of TotalView, Level 2 and OpenView, or all three 
products, for the enterprise license fee set forth in Rule 
7023(c)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. Per Subscriber Fees for Enhanced Display Solutions. The monthly 
fee for Professional Subscribers using EDS under Rule 7026(a)(1)(B) is 
$74 for TotalView and Level 2 and $6 for OpenView. Non-Professional 
Subscribers of EDS pay the applicable TotalView, Level 2 or OpenView 
rates.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ Nasdaq Rule 7026(a)(1)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. Enhanced Display Solution Enterprise License. The EDS enterprise 
license set forth in Rule 7026(a)(1)(C) allows TotalView and Level 2 to 
be distributed to an unlimited number of Professional Subscribers for 
$70, and OpenView for $6.
    6. Managed Data Solutions. Rule 7026(b) sets forth a fee structure 
for MDS that applies the same fees for the distribution of TotalView, 
Level 2 and OpenView.
Proposed Changes
    The Exchange proposes to amend the fees at Rules 7023 and 7026 to 
merge OpenView into TotalView. In substance, the Exchange will combine 
all fees for TotalView and OpenView into a single sum, without 
increasing the total price of the two products, and make a number of 
conforming changes to delete specific references to OpenView. The 
specific fee changes to Rules 7023 and 7026 are as follows:
    1. Per Subscriber Fees. Monthly Non-Professional per Subscriber 
fees will be changed from $14 for TotalView \12\ and $1 for OpenView 
\13\ to $15 for TotalView, which will be redefined in current Rule 
7023(a)(1)(C) to include OpenView data. Monthly Professional Subscriber 
fees will be changed from $70 for TotalView \14\ and $6 for OpenView 
\15\ to $76 for TotalView, which will include OpenView data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ Nasdaq Rule 7023(b)(2)(A).
    \13\ Nasdaq Rule 7023(b)(3)(A).
    \14\ Nasdaq Rule 7023(b)(2)(B). Fees are for Display Usage, or 
for Non-Display Usage based upon indirect access.
    \15\ Nasdaq Rule 7023(b)(3)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. Professional Subscriber Fees for Non-Display Usage. There will 
be no substantive change to the Professional Subscriber fees for Non-
Display Usage set forth in Nasdaq Rule 7023(b)(4), which already allows 
for the purchase of all three depth-of-book products, including 
OpenView, TotalView and Level 2, under the same fee structure. Explicit 
references to OpenView will be deleted as a technical, conforming 
change.
    3. Enterprise License Fees. There will be no substantive change to 
the enterprises [sic] license fees set forth in Nasdaq Rules 
7023(c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3), which already allow for the purchase of 
depth-of-book products, including OpenView and TotalView,\16\ for the 
same fee. Explicit references to OpenView will be deleted as a 
technical, conforming change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ Level 2 data is included under Nasdaq Rule 7023(c)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. Per Subscriber Fees for Enhanced Display Solutions. The monthly 
fee for Professional Subscribers using EDS will be changed from $74 for 
TotalView and Level 2 and $6 for OpenView \17\ to $80 for TotalView, 
which will include all OpenView data, and Level 2. Non-Professional 
Subscribers of EDS will continue to pay at the applicable TotalView or 
Level 2 rates.\18\ Explicit references to OpenView will be deleted as a 
technical, conforming change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Nasdaq Rule 7026(a)(1)(B).
    \18\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. Enhanced Display Solution Enterprise License. The monthly 
professional subscriber fee for purchasers of an enterprise license 
with EDS will be changed from $70 for TotalView and Level 2 and $6 for 
OpenView \19\ to $76 for TotalView, which will include all OpenView 
data, and Level 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ Nasdaq Rule 7026(a)(1)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. Managed Data Solutions. There will be no substantive change to 
the fee structure for MDS set forth in Rule 7026(b), which already 
allows for the distribution of all three depth-of-book products, 
including OpenView, TotalView and Level 2, under the same fee 
structure. Explicit references to OpenView will be deleted as a 
technical, conforming change.
    In addition to all of these changes, the definition of OpenView 
will be removed from the current Rule book at Rule 7023(a)(1)(B), and 
the data provided in OpenView will be added to the definition of 
TotalView currently in Rule 7023(a)(1)(C), which will be re-designated 
as Rule 7023(a)(1)(B).
    The proposed rule change will lower administrative costs and 
simplify the purchase of depth-of-book products, with no impact on fees 
for most customers. Almost all purchasers of depth products already 
purchase OpenView in conjunction with TotalView or Level 2, and prices 
will not change for these customers. Most of the limited number of 
customers purchasing TotalView or OpenView alone are in the process of 
phasing out the practice, and will not be materially affected by the 
proposed change.
    Depth-of-book customers that purchase TotalView and OpenView 
together have to manage separate reporting, billing and approvals for 
two products that they utilize as a single product. The resulting 
administrative burden applies to four separate categories of fees: (i) 
Non-Professional per Subscriber fees for TotalView \20\ and OpenView; 
\21\ (ii) Professional Subscriber fees for TotalView \22\ and OpenView; 
\23\ (iii) monthly fees for Professional and Non-Professional 
Subscribers using EDS; \24\ and (iv) monthly subscriber fees for 
purchasers of an EDS enterprise license.\25\ The proposed change will 
lessen the administrative burden on these customers--representing the 
bulk of depth-of-book purchasers--while leaving fees and product 
quality unaffected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Nasdaq has engaged in discussions with Distributors that purchase 
OpenView without TotalView or Level 2--or TotalView or Level 2 without 
OpenView--and determined that this practice is being phased out. This 
practice had its origins before Nasdaq became an Exchange, when Nasdaq 
did not trade a significant number of securities listed on other 
exchanges. Now, Nasdaq routinely trades the securities of other 
exchanges, and the rationale for this practice is obsolete. As such, 
Nasdaq does not expect merging OpenView into TotalView to have a long-
term impact on customers that are

[[Page 27320]]

already in the process of deciding whether to purchase either both 
products, or neither, because of fundamental changes in the economic 
environment. The proposed fee change--which leaves the total cost of 
OpenView and TotalView unchanged--is unlikely to alter that decision.
    No transition time is needed to merge OpenView into TotalView--they 
are already offered in a compatible formats [sic] and Distributors 
require no time to modify their systems to accommodate the change.
    The proposed fees are optional in that they apply only to firms 
that elect to purchase these products. The proposed changes do not 
impact the cost of any other Nasdaq product.
2. Statutory Basis
    The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,\26\ in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) of the Act,\27\ in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and 
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any 
facility, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.

    \27\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission and the courts have repeatedly expressed their 
preference for competition over regulatory intervention in determining 
prices, products, and services in the securities markets. In Regulation 
NMS, while adopting a series of steps to improve the current market 
model, the Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in 
determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current 
regulation of the market system ``has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its broader forms that are most 
important to investors and listed companies.'' \28\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 
2005), 70 FR 37496, 37499 (June 29, 2005) (``Regulation NMS Adopting 
Release'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission 
\29\ (``NetCoalition'') the D.C. Circuit upheld the Commission's use of 
a market-based approach in evaluating the fairness of market data fees 
against a challenge claiming that Congress mandated a cost-based 
approach.\30\ As the court emphasized, the Commission ``intended in 
Regulation NMS that `market forces, rather than regulatory 
requirements' play a role in determining the market data . . . to be 
made available to investors and at what cost.'' \31\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ Id. at 537.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further, ``[n]o one disputes that competition for order flow is 
`fierce.' . . . As the SEC explained, `[i]n the U.S. national market 
system, buyers and sellers of securities, and the broker-dealers that 
act as their order-routing agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution'; [and] `no exchange can afford to 
take its market share percentages for granted' because `no exchange 
possesses a monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in the execution of 
order flow from broker dealers' . . . .'' \32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ Id. at 539 (quoting Securities Exchange Act Release No. 
59039 (December 2, 2008), 73 FR 74770, 74782-83 (December 9, 2008) 
(SR-NYSEArca-2006-21)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Exchange believes that the proposal to integrate Nasdaq 
TotalView and OpenView into a single depth-of-book product is an 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees or other charges. Almost 
all purchasers of Nasdaq depth-of-book products already treat TotalView 
and OpenView as a single, combined product, and the proposed changes 
will reduce administrative burden. Customers that do not currently 
purchase both products are already in the process of deciding whether 
to purchase either both products, or neither, and the proposed fee 
change--which leaves the total cost of OpenView and TotalView 
unchanged--is unlikely to alter that decision. The fees for TotalView 
and OpenView, like all proprietary data fees, are constrained by the 
Exchange's need to compete for order flow, and are subject to 
competition from other products and among broker-dealers for customers. 
If Nasdaq is incorrect in its assessment of these markets, there are no 
barriers to entry for competitors with substantially similar products.
    The Exchange believes that the proposed fee changes are an 
equitable allocation because the fees appropriately reflect the value 
of depth-of-market data to customers as well as industry practice in 
which most customers purchase the current versions of TotalView and 
OpenView concurrently. The proposed fee changes are not unfairly 
discriminatory because the Exchange will apply the same fee to all 
similarly-situated subscribers.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

    The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. In terms of inter-market 
competition, the Exchange notes that it operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive. In such an environment, the Exchange must continually adjust 
its fees to remain competitive with other exchanges and with 
alternative trading systems that have been exempted from compliance 
with the statutory standards applicable to exchanges. Because 
competitors are free to modify their own fees in response, and because 
market participants may readily adjust their order routing practices, 
the Exchange believes that the degree to which fee changes in this 
market may impose any burden on competition is extremely limited.
    The question of whether the prices of depth-of-view products are 
constrained by competitive forces was examined in 2016 by an 
Administrative Law Judge in an application for review by the Securities 
Industry and Financial Markets Association of actions taken by Self-
Regulatory Organizations.\33\ After a four-day hearing and presentation 
of substantial evidence, the administrative law judge stated that 
``competition plays a significant role in restraining exchange pricing 
of depth-of-book products'' \34\ because ``depth-of-book products from 
different exchanges function as substitutes for each other,'' \35\ and, 
as such, ``the threat of substitution from depth-of-book customers 
constrains their depth-of-book prices.'' \36\ In addition, the 
administrative law judge stated that ``[s]hifts in order flow and 
threats of shifting order flow provide a significant competitive force 
in the pricing of . . . depth-of-book data.'' \37\ As such, Nasdaq's 
depth-of-book fees are ``constrained by significant competitive 
forces.'' \38\ As an example of the impact of market forces on the 
price of proprietary data, the Exchange recently lowered the Nasdaq 
Basic enterprise license fee for the distribution of certain 
information by broker-dealers from $350,000 to $100,000.\39\

    The proposed changes will integrate Nasdaq TotalView and OpenView 
into a single depth-of-book product. If the proposed product revisions 
are unattractive to market participants, it is likely that the Exchange 
will lose market share.
    Market forces constrain fees for TotalView, like all depth-of-book 
products, in three respects. First, all fees related to TotalView are 
constrained by competition among exchanges and other entities 
attracting order flow. Firms make decisions regarding depth-of-book 
products and other proprietary data based on the total cost of 
interacting with the Exchange, and order flow would be harmed by the 
supracompetitive pricing of any proprietary data product. Second, the 
prices of TotalView are constrained by the existence of substitutes 
that are offered, or may be offered, by entities that offer proprietary 
data. Third, competition among Distributors for customers will further 
constrain the cost of TotalView.
Competition for Order Flow
    Fees related to TotalView are constrained by competition among 
exchanges and other entities seeking to attract order flow. Order flow 
is the ``life blood'' of the exchanges. Broker-dealers currently have 
numerous alternative venues for their order flow, including self-
regulatory organization (``SRO'') markets, as well as internalizing 
broker-dealers (``BDs'') and various forms of alternative trading 
systems (``ATSs''), including dark pools and electronic communication 
networks (``ECNs''). Each SRO market competes to produce transaction 
reports via trade executions, and two FINRA-regulated Trade Reporting 
Facilities (``TRFs'') compete to attract internalized transaction 
reports. The existence of fierce competition for order flow implies a 
high degree of price sensitivity on the part of BDs, which may readily 
reduce costs by directing orders toward the lowest-cost trading venues.
    The level of competition and contestability in the market for order 
flow is demonstrated by the numerous examples of entrants that swiftly 
grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and 
proprietary data producers: Archipelago, Bloomberg Tradebook, Island, 
RediBook, Attain, TracECN, and the BATS exchanges. A proliferation of 
dark pools and other ATSs operate profitably with fragmentary shares of 
consolidated market volume. For a variety of reasons, competition from 
new entrants, especially for order execution, has increased 
dramatically over the last decade.
    Each SRO, TRF, ATS, and BD that competes for order flow is 
permitted to produce proprietary data products. Many currently do or 
have announced plans to do so, including NYSE, NYSE Amex, NYSE Arca, 
the BATS exchanges, and IEX. This is because Regulation NMS deregulated 
the market for proprietary data. While BDs had previously published 
their proprietary data individually, Regulation NMS encourages market 
data vendors and BDs to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a 
manner never before possible. Order routers and market data vendors can 
facilitate production of proprietary data products for single or 
multiple BDs. The potential sources of proprietary products are 
virtually limitless.
    The markets for order flow and proprietary data are inextricably 
linked: A trading platform cannot generate market information unless it 
receives trade orders. As a result, the competition for order flow 
constrains the prices that platforms can charge for proprietary data 
products. Firms make decisions on how much and what types of data to 
consume based on the total cost of interacting with Nasdaq and other 
exchanges. Data fees are but one factor in a total platform analysis. 
If the cost of the product exceeds its expected value, the broker-
dealer will choose not to buy it. A supracompetitive increase in the 
fees charged for either transactions or proprietary data has the 
potential to impair revenues from both products. In this manner, the 
competition for order flow will constrain prices for proprietary data 
products.
Substitute Products
    The price of depth-of-book data is constrained by the existence of 
competition from other exchanges, such as NYSE and the BATS exchanges, 
which sell proprietary depth-of-book data. While a small number of 
highly sophisticated traders purchase depth-of-book products from 
multiple exchanges, most customers do not. Because most customers would 
not pay an excessive price for TotalView when substitute data is 
available from other proprietary sources, the Exchange is constrained 
in its pricing decisions.
Competition Among Distributors
    Competition among Distributors provides another form of price 
discipline for proprietary data products to ensure that fees are 
equitable, fair, reasonable and not unfairly discriminatory. If the 
price of TotalView were set above competitive levels, Distributors 
purchasing TotalView would be at a disadvantage relative to their 
competitors, and would therefore either purchase a substitute or forego 
the product altogether.
    In summary, market forces constrain the price of depth-of-book data 
such as TotalView through competition for order flow, competition from 
substitute products, and in the competition among vendors for 
customers.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed 
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others

    No written comments were either solicited or received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

    Because the foregoing proposed rule change does not: (i) 
Significantly affect the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant burden on competition; and (iii) 
become operative for 30 days from the date on which it was filed, or 
such shorter time as the Commission may designate, it has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act \40\ and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.\41\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \40\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii).
    \41\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b-4(f)(6) 
requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change at 
least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed 
rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. 
The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule 
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is: (i) 
Necessary or appropriate in the public interest; (ii) for the 
protection of investors; or (iii) otherwise in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether the 
proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.

Drawing on its heritage as the American Stock Exchange, NYSE American is an exchange designed for growing companies, and offers investors greater choice in how they trade.
NYSE American is a competitively priced venue that blends unique features derived from the NYSE, such as electronic Designated Market Makers (e-DMMs) with quoting obligations for each NYSE American-listed company, with NYSE Arca’s fully electronic price/time priority execution model.
NYSE American also delivers advanced functionality, such as an intentional delay mechanism, which is intended to encourage midpoint trading strategies, and discretionary pegged orders, which provide investors with an additional tactic to patiently enter and exit positions while limiting adverse selection.

NYSE American Offers:
Dedicated e-DMMs with quoting obligations in NYSE American-listed securities to enhance price discovery and liquidity
Trading in all 8,000+ NMS securities in a fully electronic manner, including electronic auctions in NYSE American-listed securities
An intentional 350 microsecond delay on all orders, proprietary data feeds and outbound routing to allow resting pegged orders to re-price before new incoming orders arrive  Trades and quotes, however, will be reported to the Securities Information Processor (SIP) without an added delay 
Discretionary pegged orders, which peg to the near side of the protected best bid and offer (PBBO), i.e., buys peg to the bid and sells peg to the offer. The order will automatically adjust as the PBBO changes, and has discretion to trade up to the midpoint of the PBBO under stable quote conditions.

The Nasdaq Stock Market (/ˈnæzˌdæk/ ( listen)) is an American stock exchange. It is the second-largest exchange in the world by market capitalization, behind only the New York Stock Exchange.[2] The exchange platform is owned by Nasdaq, Inc.,[3] which also owns the Nasdaq Nordic (formerly known as OMX) and Nasdaq Baltic stock market network and several other US stock and options exchanges.

History[edit]
When it was founded, NASDAQ stood for the acronym of "National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations".[4] NASDAQ was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD),[5] which divested itself of NASDAQ in a series of sales in 2000 and 2001. The Nasdaq Stock Market is owned and operated by Nasdaq, Inc., the stocks of which were listed on its own stock exchange marketing July 2, 2002, under the ticker symbol NDAQ.

When the Nasdaq Stock Market began trading on February 8, 1971, it was the world's first electronic stock market. At first, it was merely a quotation system and did not provide a way to perform electronic trades.[6] The Nasdaq Stock Market helped lower the spread (the difference between the bid price and the ask price of the stock) but was unpopular among brokerages which made much of their money on the spread.
The Nasdaq Stock Market eventually assumed the majority of major trades that had been executed by the over-the-counter (OTC) system of trading, although there are still many securities traded in this fashion. As late as 1987, the NASDAQ exchange was still commonly referred to as "OTC" in media[7] and also in the monthly Stock Guides (stock guides and prodecures) issued by Standard & Poor's Corporation.[citation needed]
Over the years, the Nasdaq Stock Market became more of a stock market by adding trade and volume reporting and automated trading systems. It was also the first stock market in the United States to start trading online, highlighting Nasdaq-traded companies and closing with the declaration that the Nasdaq Stock Market is "the stock market for the next hundred years". The Nasdaq Stock Market attracted new growth companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, Oracle and Dell and helped modernize the IPO.
Its main index is the NASDAQ Composite, which has been published since its inception. However, its exchange-traded fund tracks the large-cap NASDAQ-100 index, which was introduced in 1985 alongside the NASDAQ 100 Financial Index which tracks the largest 100 companies in terms of market capitalization.
In 1992, the Nasdaq Stock Market joined with the London Stock Exchange to form the first intercontinental linkage of securities markets. The National Association of Securities Dealers spun off the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2000 to form a publicly traded company.
In 2006, the status of the Nasdaq Stock Market was changed from a stock market to a licensed national securities exchange.[8]
In 2007, Nasdaq merged with OMX, a leading exchange operator in the Nordic countries, expanded its global footprint, and changed its name to the NASDAQ OMX Group[9].
To qualify for listing on the exchange, a company must be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), must have at least three market makers (financial firms that act as brokers or dealers for specific securities) and must meet minimum requirements for assets, capital, public shares, and shareholders.
In February 2011, in the wake of an announced merger of NYSE Euronext with Deutsche Börse, speculation developed that NASDAQ OMX and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) could mount a counter-bid of their own for NYSE. NASDAQ OMX could be[when?] looking to acquire the American exchange's cash equities business, ICE the derivatives business. At the time, "NYSE Euronext’s market value was $9.75 billion. Nasdaq was valued at $5.78 billion, while ICE was valued at $9.45 billion."[10] Late in the month, Nasdaq was reported to be considering asking either ICE or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to join in what would probably have to be, if it proceeded, an $11–12 billion counterbid.[11]
The European Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System (EASDAQ) was founded as a European equivalent to the Nasdaq Stock Market. It was purchased by NASDAQ in 2001 and became NASDAQ Europe. Operations were shut down, however, as a result of the burst of the dot-com bubble. In 2007, NASDAQ Europe was revived as Equiduct, and is currently[when?] operating under Börse Berlin.[12]
On June 18, 2012, NASDAQ OMX became a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative on the eve of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20).[13]
In November 2016, NASDAQ Chief Operating Officer Adena Friedman was promoted to the role of CEO, becoming the first woman to run a major exchange in the U.S.[14]
Quote availability[edit]
NASDAQ quotes are available at three levels:

Level 1 shows the highest bid and lowest ask—inside quote.
Level 2 shows all public quotes of market makers together with information of market dealers wishing to buy or sell stock and recently executed orders.[15]
Level 3 is used by the market makers and allows them to enter their quotes and execute orders.[16]

Trading schedule[edit]
The Nasdaq Stock Market sessions eastern time are:
4:00 am to 9:30 am premarket session
9:30 am to 4:00 pm normal trading session
4:00 pm to 8:00 pm postmarket session[17]
Market tiers[edit]
The Nasdaq Stock Market has three different market tiers:

Capital Market (small cap) is an equity market for companies that have relatively small levels of market capitalization. Listing requirements for such "small cap" companies are less stringent than for other Nasdaq markets that list larger companies with significantly higher market capitalization.[18]
Global Market (mid cap) is made up of stocks that represent the Nasdaq Global Market. The Global Market consists of 1,450 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and liquidity requirements, and corporate governance standards. The Global Market is less exclusive than the Global Select Market.[19]
Global Select Market (NASDAQ-GS large cap) is a market capitalization-weighted index made up of US-based and international stocks that represent the Global Select Market Composite. The Global Select Market consists of 1,200 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and liquidity requirements and corporate governance standards. The Global Select Market is more exclusive than the Global Market. Every October, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department reviews the Global Market Composite to determine if any of its stocks have become eligible for listing on the Global Select Market.[20][21]

Average annualized growth rate[edit]
As of June 2015, the Nasdaq Stock Market had an average annualized growth rate of 9.24% since its opening in February 1971. Since the end of the recession in June 2009 however, it has increased by 18.29% per year.[22]

The Nasdaq Stock Market (/ˈnæzˌdæk/ ( listen)) is an American stock exchange. It is the second-largest exchange in the world by market capitalization, behind only the New York Stock Exchange.[2] The exchange platform is owned by Nasdaq, Inc.,[3] which also owns the Nasdaq Nordic (formerly known as OMX) and Nasdaq Baltic stock market network and several other US stock and options exchanges.

History[edit]
When it was founded, NASDAQ stood for the acronym of "National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations".[4] NASDAQ was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD),[5] which divested itself of NASDAQ in a series of sales in 2000 and 2001. The Nasdaq Stock Market is owned and operated by Nasdaq, Inc., the stocks of which were listed on its own stock exchange marketing July 2, 2002, under the ticker symbol NDAQ.




Former logo


When the Nasdaq Stock Market began trading on February 8, 1971, it was the world's first electronic stock market. At first, it was merely a quotation system and did not provide a way to perform electronic trades.[6] The Nasdaq Stock Market helped lower the spread (the difference between the bid price and the ask price of the stock) but was unpopular among brokerages which made much of their money on the spread.
The Nasdaq Stock Market eventually assumed the majority of major trades that had been executed by the over-the-counter (OTC) system of trading, although there are still many securities traded in this fashion. As late as 1987, the NASDAQ exchange was still commonly referred to as "OTC" in media[7] and also in the monthly Stock Guides (stock guides and prodecures) issued by Standard & Poor's Corporation.[citation needed]
Over the years, the Nasdaq Stock Market became more of a stock market by adding trade and volume reporting and automated trading systems. It was also the first stock market in the United States to start trading online, highlighting Nasdaq-traded companies and closing with the declaration that the Nasdaq Stock Market is "the stock market for the next hundred years". The Nasdaq Stock Market attracted new growth companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, Oracle and Dell and helped modernize the IPO.
Its main index is the NASDAQ Composite, which has been published since its inception. However, its exchange-traded fund tracks the large-cap NASDAQ-100 index, which was introduced in 1985 alongside the NASDAQ 100 Financial Index which tracks the largest 100 companies in terms of market capitalization.
In 1992, the Nasdaq Stock Market joined with the London Stock Exchange to form the first intercontinental linkage of securities markets. The National Association of Securities Dealers spun off the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2000 to form a publicly traded company.
In 2006, the status of the Nasdaq Stock Market was changed from a stock market to a licensed national securities exchange.[8]
In 2007, Nasdaq merged with OMX, a leading exchange operator in the Nordic countries, expanded its global footprint, and changed its name to the NASDAQ OMX Group[9].
To qualify for listing on the exchange, a company must be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), must have at least three market makers (financial firms that act as brokers or dealers for specific securities) and must meet minimum requirements for assets, capital, public shares, and shareholders.
In February 2011, in the wake of an announced merger of NYSE Euronext with Deutsche Börse, speculation developed that NASDAQ OMX and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) could mount a counter-bid of their own for NYSE. NASDAQ OMX could be[when?] looking to acquire the American exchange's cash equities business, ICE the derivatives business. At the time, "NYSE Euronext’s market value was $9.75 billion. Nasdaq was valued at $5.78 billion, while ICE was valued at $9.45 billion."[10] Late in the month, Nasdaq was reported to be considering asking either ICE or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to join in what would probably have to be, if it proceeded, an $11–12 billion counterbid.[11]
The European Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System (EASDAQ) was founded as a European equivalent to the Nasdaq Stock Market. It was purchased by NASDAQ in 2001 and became NASDAQ Europe. Operations were shut down, however, as a result of the burst of the dot-com bubble. In 2007, NASDAQ Europe was revived as Equiduct, and is currently[when?] operating under Börse Berlin.[12]
On June 18, 2012, NASDAQ OMX became a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative on the eve of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20).[13]
In November 2016, NASDAQ Chief Operating Officer Adena Friedman was promoted to the role of CEO, becoming the first woman to run a major exchange in the U.S.[14]
Quote availability[edit]
NASDAQ quotes are available at three levels:

Level 1 shows the highest bid and lowest ask—inside quote.
Level 2 shows all public quotes of market makers together with information of market dealers wishing to buy or sell stock and recently executed orders.[15]
Level 3 is used by the market makers and allows them to enter their quotes and execute orders.[16]

Trading schedule[edit]
The Nasdaq Stock Market sessions eastern time are:
4:00 am to 9:30 am premarket session
9:30 am to 4:00 pm normal trading session
4:00 pm to 8:00 pm postmarket session[17]
Market tiers[edit]
The Nasdaq Stock Market has three different market tiers:

Capital Market (small cap) is an equity market for companies that have relatively small levels of market capitalization. Listing requirements for such "small cap" companies are less stringent than for other Nasdaq markets that list larger companies with significantly higher market capitalization.[18]
Global Market (mid cap) is made up of stocks that represent the Nasdaq Global Market. The Global Market consists of 1,450 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and liquidity requirements, and corporate governance standards. The Global Market is less exclusive than the Global Select Market.[19]
Global Select Market (NASDAQ-GS large cap) is a market capitalization-weighted index made up of US-based and international stocks that represent the Global Select Market Composite. The Global Select Market consists of 1,200 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and liquidity requirements and corporate governance standards. The Global Select Market is more exclusive than the Global Market. Every October, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department reviews the Global Market Composite to determine if any of its stocks have become eligible for listing on the Global Select Market.[20][21]

Average annualized growth rate[edit]
As of June 2015, the Nasdaq Stock Market had an average annualized growth rate of 9.24% since its opening in February 1971. Since the end of the recession in June 2009 however, it has increased by 18.29% per year.[22]

The Nasdaq Stock Market (/ˈnæzˌdæk/ ( listen)) is an American stock exchange. It is the second-largest exchange in the world by market capitalization, behind only the New York Stock Exchange.[2] The exchange platform is owned by Nasdaq, Inc.,[3] which also owns the Nasdaq Nordic (formerly known as OMX) and Nasdaq Baltic stock market network and several other US stock and options exchanges.

History[edit]
When it was founded, NASDAQ stood for the acronym of "National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations".[4] NASDAQ was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD),[5] which divested itself of NASDAQ in a series of sales in 2000 and 2001. The Nasdaq Stock Market is owned and operated by Nasdaq, Inc., the stocks of which were listed on its own stock exchange marketing July 2, 2002, under the ticker symbol NDAQ.

When the Nasdaq Stock Market began trading on February 8, 1971, it was the world's first electronic stock market. At first, it was merely a quotation system and did not provide a way to perform electronic trades.[6] The Nasdaq Stock Market helped lower the spread (the difference between the bid price and the ask price of the stock) but was unpopular among brokerages which made much of their money on the spread.
The Nasdaq Stock Market eventually assumed the majority of major trades that had been executed by the over-the-counter (OTC) system of trading, although there are still many securities traded in this fashion. As late as 1987, the NASDAQ exchange was still commonly referred to as "OTC" in media[7] and also in the monthly Stock Guides (stock guides and prodecures) issued by Standard & Poor's Corporation.[citation needed]
Over the years, the Nasdaq Stock Market became more of a stock market by adding trade and volume reporting and automated trading systems. It was also the first stock market in the United States to start trading online, highlighting Nasdaq-traded companies and closing with the declaration that the Nasdaq Stock Market is "the stock market for the next hundred years". The Nasdaq Stock Market attracted new growth companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, Oracle and Dell and helped modernize the IPO.
Its main index is the NASDAQ Composite, which has been published since its inception. However, its exchange-traded fund tracks the large-cap NASDAQ-100 index, which was introduced in 1985 alongside the NASDAQ 100 Financial Index which tracks the largest 100 companies in terms of market capitalization.
In 1992, the Nasdaq Stock Market joined with the London Stock Exchange to form the first intercontinental linkage of securities markets. The National Association of Securities Dealers spun off the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2000 to form a publicly traded company.
In 2006, the status of the Nasdaq Stock Market was changed from a stock market to a licensed national securities exchange.[8]
In 2007, Nasdaq merged with OMX, a leading exchange operator in the Nordic countries, expanded its global footprint, and changed its name to the NASDAQ OMX Group[9].
To qualify for listing on the exchange, a company must be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), must have at least three market makers (financial firms that act as brokers or dealers for specific securities) and must meet minimum requirements for assets, capital, public shares, and shareholders.
In February 2011, in the wake of an announced merger of NYSE Euronext with Deutsche Börse, speculation developed that NASDAQ OMX and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) could mount a counter-bid of their own for NYSE. NASDAQ OMX could be[when?] looking to acquire the American exchange's cash equities business, ICE the derivatives business. At the time, "NYSE Euronext’s market value was $9.75 billion. Nasdaq was valued at $5.78 billion, while ICE was valued at $9.45 billion."[10] Late in the month, Nasdaq was reported to be considering asking either ICE or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to join in what would probably have to be, if it proceeded, an $11–12 billion counterbid.[11]
The European Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System (EASDAQ) was founded as a European equivalent to the Nasdaq Stock Market. It was purchased by NASDAQ in 2001 and became NASDAQ Europe. Operations were shut down, however, as a result of the burst of the dot-com bubble. In 2007, NASDAQ Europe was revived as Equiduct, and is currently[when?] operating under Börse Berlin.[12]
On June 18, 2012, NASDAQ OMX became a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative on the eve of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20).[13]
In November 2016, NASDAQ Chief Operating Officer Adena Friedman was promoted to the role of CEO, becoming the first woman to run a major exchange in the U.S.[14]
Quote availability[edit]
NASDAQ quotes are available at three levels:

Level 1 shows the highest bid and lowest ask—inside quote.
Level 2 shows all public quotes of market makers together with information of market dealers wishing to buy or sell stock and recently executed orders.[15]
Level 3 is used by the market makers and allows them to enter their quotes and execute orders.[16]

Trading schedule[edit]
The Nasdaq Stock Market sessions eastern time are:
4:00 am to 9:30 am premarket session
9:30 am to 4:00 pm normal trading session
4:00 pm to 8:00 pm postmarket session[17]
Market tiers[edit]
The Nasdaq Stock Market has three different market tiers:

Capital Market (small cap) is an equity market for companies that have relatively small levels of market capitalization. Listing requirements for such "small cap" companies are less stringent than for other Nasdaq markets that list larger companies with significantly higher market capitalization.[18]
Global Market (mid cap) is made up of stocks that represent the Nasdaq Global Market. The Global Market consists of 1,450 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and liquidity requirements, and corporate governance standards. The Global Market is less exclusive than the Global Select Market.[19]
Global Select Market (NASDAQ-GS large cap) is a market capitalization-weighted index made up of US-based and international stocks that represent the Global Select Market Composite. The Global Select Market consists of 1,200 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and liquidity requirements and corporate governance standards. The Global Select Market is more exclusive than the Global Market. Every October, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department reviews the Global Market Composite to determine if any of its stocks have become eligible for listing on the Global Select Market.[20][21]

Average annualized growth rate[edit]
As of June 2015, the Nasdaq Stock Market had an average annualized growth rate of 9.24% since its opening in February 1971. Since the end of the recession in June 2009 however, it has increased by 18.29% per year.[22]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

What Past Market Declines Can Teach Us
Stock market declines are the last thing most investors want to experience, but they are an inevitable part of investing. Perhaps a little historical background can help you put stock market declines in perspective.
Types of Stock Market Declines
A look back at stock market history since 1900 shows that declines have varied widely in intensity, length and frequency. In the midst of a decline, it’s been nearly impossible to tell the difference between a slight dip and a more prolonged correction.

The table below shows that declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been somewhat regular events.

Lessons Learned From Market Declines
Living with a market decline isn’t easy, but if you understand these 3 key lessons, you’ll be a more intelligent investor.













No one can predict consistently when market declines will happen.
It’s easy to look back today and say with hindsight that the stock market was overvalued at a particular time and due for a decline. But no one has been able to accurately predict market declines on a consistent basis.
In January 1973, a New York Times poll of 8 market authorities predicted that the market would “move somewhat higher” in the future. The Dow industrials proceeded to decline 45% over the next 23 months. Then, although almost no one predicted it, the Dow rose 38% in 1975.




 






No one can predict how long a decline will last.

Since 1982, with few exceptions, market declines have been relatively brief. Earlier market declines have lasted longer.

After the 1929 crash, it took investors 16 years to restore their investments if they invested at the market high. In 2000, it took about 5 years. But after the 1987 crash, it took about 23 months to get back. In 1990, it took about 8 months. (In all cases, dividends were assumed to be reinvested.)




 






No one can consistently predict the right time to get in or out of the market.

Successful market timing during a decline is extremely difficult because it requires a pair of near-perfect actions: getting out and then getting back in at the right time.

A common mistake investors make is to lose patience and sell at or near the bottom of a downturn. But even if you have decent timing and get out early in a decline, you still have to figure out when to get back in.

A bear market is not usually characterized by a straight-line decline in stock prices. Instead, the market’s downward trend is likely to be jagged — showing bursts of stock price increases, known as “sucker’s rallies,” and then declines.




 






Be sure to talk to your financial professional before making any changes to your financial plan.

Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
