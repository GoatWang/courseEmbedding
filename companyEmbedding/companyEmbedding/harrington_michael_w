Inside This Section





        More About NADA
    



The NADA Story                                                                  
    

The NADA story began in 1917 when 30 auto dealers traveled to the nation’s capital to convince Congress not to impose a luxury tax on the automobile. They successfully argued that the automobile is a necessity of American life, not a luxury. From that experience, NADA was born. Today, NADA represents nearly 16,500 new-car and -truck dealers, with 32,500 franchises, both domestic and international.




Mission Statement                                                             
    

The purpose of the National Automobile Dealers Association is to serve and represent the franchised new-car and -truck dealers of America, their management and employees.                                                                           
    
NADA has two main goals:                                                                           
    
1. To promote and enhance the franchise system and effectively communicate dealer views and concerns to all branches of the federal government, to manufacturers, and the public; and                                                                      
        
    
2. To strengthen the financial position of members as retailers through professional programs and services that improve the business skills of management personnel and the technical capabilities of non-management employees.
