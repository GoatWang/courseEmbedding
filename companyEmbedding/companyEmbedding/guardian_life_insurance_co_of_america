What is Disability Income Insurance?












YOU CAN’T WORK. FORTUNATELY, YOUR COVERAGE WILL.
People often ask: What is disability income insurance? One myth about disability income insurance (or, simply – disability insurance) is that it is only for rare, catastrophic accidents. In reality, many rely on these policies to cover the income they’ve lost due to relatively common conditions such as heart disease and arthritis. Learn how disability insurance works – protect yourself and your business.










Types We Offer


















What it is
Benefits
Who it's Best for






Individual Disability Insurance


Replaces income if you’re too sick or injured to work.
Can supplement long-term disability coverage that you may have through your employer.

Replaces a percentage of base salary and regular bonus or incentive income.
Can cover retirement contributions and student loan payments.
When you pay for this individual coverage with after-tax dollars, any benefit payments you receive are tax free.
Your policy belongs to you even if you change jobs.



You or your family relies on your income.
You are a high-earning individual who needs more income protection than the coverage offered by your employer.
You don’t have any disability insurance through work. 
 





Small Business Protection


As a small business owner, different types of disability insurance can help protect your business if you can’t work as a result of an injury or illness.  

Provides several options to help your business continue meeting its daily expenses – including employees’ salaries.
Offers funding to buy out a partner who can’t work due to illness or injury.
Continues payment of business loans.



You’re a small business owner who wants to be certain your business can keep running if you become unable to work due to illness or injury.
 





Basic Disability Offered by Employer


Replaces baseline income if you’re too ill or injured to work.

Provides a good foundation for income protection – typically safeguards from 40% to 60% of your base salary after taxes.



Your employer provides this coverage. Basic coverage protects about half of your income.
 





Supplemental Individual Disability Income Insurance


Extra coverage that your employer can offer on top of the base long-term disability insurance they may already offer you.

Can help you protect more of your base salary as well as different types of income like bonuses and incentive compensation.  
You own the policy, even if you change jobs.
No medical exam is required, making it an easy option.



Your employer offers this coverage and you want to safeguard more of your income.
Most of your income is derived from bonus or commissions.
 




















 How Much Does It Cost to Protect Your Income? 


                   
                      Use this calculator to estimate the monthly cost of disability income insurance in less than one minute!

LIFE THROWS THINGS YOUR WAY YOU DIDN’T PLAN ON
Every day, people are required to face the unexpected. If you can’t work because of an illness or injury, disability income insurance helps replace a portion of your income. It lets you focus on your recovery instead of worrying about your finances.

Chances are the basic disability benefits offered through your employer might cover 60% of your income at best. The rest would come out of your pocket. Supplemental disability insurance is comprehensive, covering you where other plans may leave off. An accident or illness does not necessarily have to be a financial catastrophe.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

What are Workplace Benefits?












BENEFITS AT WORK PROVIDE EMPLOYEES MORE THAN A PAYCHECK
Benefits offered through work have become increasingly important to Americans, and are now a key differentiator in picking one job over the other. From dental and vision, to life and disability insurance, these workplace benefits occupy a role in helping employees to feel more financially confident.










My Benefits at Work










 Life and Disability Income Insurance
FOR ALMOST EVERYONE, YOUR PAYCHECK IS YOUR LIVELIHOOD
While you may be a great saver, your financial security, and that of your loved ones, probably depends a great extent on your regular income. Disability insurance helps protect income during an illness or injury, while life insurance sets up a sum of money for your loved ones if you’re no longer able to be there for them. That’s what makes the insurance your employer offers so important.
Learn about income protection 

 Vision and Dental Insurance
LOOKING FOR DENTAL AND VISION CARE? START AT WORK.
Taking care of your teeth and vision are important for everyone, at every stage of life. The good thing is, some insurance will help with the costs. Find out whether or not your plans at work offer you the ability to see the dentist or get a new pair of glasses more affordably. 
More on protecting your health 

 Critical Illness, Cancer, and Accident Insurance
CONCENTRATE ON GETTING WELL – NOT THE COST
When unexpected life events happen, medical insurance may not cover all the costs associated with major illnesses. To reduce the burden of these expenses and protect your savings, offerings like critical illness, cancer, accident, and hospital indemnity insurance are available.
Why medical insurance isn’t enough 









COVERING YOUR EMPLOYEES









Workplace benefits are important. In fact eight out of 10 employees now say that benefits are a major factor in choosing which job to take1. Disability income insurance, life insurance, and dental and vision plans are a great way to provide a solid base of financial security and a means to a healthier lifestyle for your employees. These plans can be bundled or added on in a customized way. By offering this type of protection to current or potential employees, you are investing in the well-being of your people. 








 
KEEP YOUR EMPLOYEES SMILING, WITH A DENTAL PLAN

Dental care is a necessity, yet it’s not part of most conventional health plans. With one of the largest networks of dentists in the US, Guardian dental plans cover over seven million people and provide your employees with the coverage they’re looking for. 
Why dental insurance for your employees? 









 
TAKE CARE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE


Offering life insurance to your employees helps them financially support those they care most about at a very difficult time. It allows them to be secure in knowing their loved ones will be provided for.
Why life insurance for your employees? 









 
EMPOWER YOUR EMPLOYEES TO PROTECT THEIR SALARY


Your employees work hard. In times of sickness or injury they need income to maintain their standard of living. Help your employees by offering disability income insurance.
Why disability insurance for your employees? 









 
OFFER VISION CARE. SEE HAPPIER EMPLOYEES.


Vision care is an important part of overall health. Give your employees access to one of the largest networks of reliable doctors, help them save on vision care, glasses, contacts, and more. 
Why vision insurance for your employees? 








It’s important to help your employees thrive and stay healthy. One of the most significant ways you can help as an employer is to make comprehensive benefits packages available – offering voluntary benefits like cancer, critical illness, and accident insurance that they can opt into.








 
KEEP YOUR EMPLOYEES SMILING, WITH A DENTAL PLAN

Typical medical plans don’t cover many of the costs involved in hospital stays. Help employees by offering them real protection, with Hospital Indemnity benefits.
WHY HOSPITAL INDEMNITY INSURANCE FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES? 









 
WHEN SERIOUS ILLNESSES OCCUR, SECURITY COUNTS

It’s a two-way street: You depend on your employees, and they depend on you. Critical illness plans provide coverage in the event of serious illnesses, such as heart attacks. The cost of deductibles, transport, and treatments not covered by basic plans quickly add up. Allow your employees to protect themselves.  
Why offer critical illness insurance? 

 
ACCIDENTS COME WITHOUT WARNING. THAT’S WHY YOU PLAN.
Even the best medical insurance plans may not fully cover expenses such as X-rays, co-pays, ambulances, and recovery costs. Accident insurance provides a benefit to help pay those bills. Your employees will value the ability to opt for the extra coverage.
Why accident insurance for your employees? 

 
WHEN YOU’RE FIGHTING CANCER, MONEY SHOULDN’T ADD TO THE WORRY
One in three Americans have a risk of developing cancer at some point in their lives2. Giving your employees the opportunity to buy cancer insurance provides them with financial protection at a very tough time in life.
Why cancer insurance for your employees? 







Guardian offers a number of add-on products and services to enhance the protection you provide to your employees. TRIP helps with travel-related emergencies and issues, and WorkLifeMatters is an employee assistance program that lets employees access skilled professionals in full confidentiality to consult on important areas of life – from family counseling to finding a lawyer.








 
WHEN TRAVEL EMERGENCIES COME UP, TRIP IS THERE
Your employees many need to travel for your company. Or they may want to see the world for their own reasons. If they get sick abroad and they need help, TRIP is a service that covers them for the unexpected, from medical emergencies to lost tickets. Let them know they’ve got access to professional resources, wherever life’s journey takes them.
Why TRIP Insurance for your employees? 

 
LIFE CAN BE EASIER WHEN YOU CAN ACCESS EXPERTS
Sometimes people need private advice. Help your employees access experts through our comprehensive service – in absolute confidentiality. From marriage to adoption to psychological and legal counseling, employees can speak with certified professionals. It matters.
Why WorkLifeMatters for your employees? 








 
UNDERSTANDING BENEFITS IS IMPORTANT


Once you start offering Guardian coverage, we can help you provide comprehensive yet simple enrollment strategies for your employees, through our website, printed and online materials, or in person if you’re interested. 
Why Enrollment Services? 









 
THERE ARE BENEFITS TO KEEPING EMPLOYEES HAPPY


High up on the list of what employees seek: job benefits. Find out why a better benefits offering may help you to stand out as an employer.

About Us









How does a company get to be over 150 years old, while still staying relevant today? The answer lies in maintaining a strong set of values while keeping our clients’ needs primary in everything we do. As a mutual insurance company, we are owned by our policyholders who share in Guardian’s actual financial results through annual dividends*. These payments are determined by the firm’s profits, and Guardian has paid a dividend every year since 1868. We take the very long view, invest soundly, and maintain a strong capital base that enables us to meet our insurance commitments today and far into the future. Our sole responsibility is to our clients and policyholders, and that is reflected in everything we do.

History[edit]




The former Germania/Guardian Life Insurance Building in Union Square, Manhattan


Guardian founder Hugo Wesendonck, a German civil rights lawyer, participated in the 1848-49 revolution and helped draft a constitution for a united Germany. Accused of treason, he fled post-revolution Europe and landed in the U.S. With start-up funds from fellow German refugees, he opened Germania Life Insurance Company in 1860 on Wall Street in Manhattan, to cover the growing number of German immigrants arriving on American shores. Two years later, he opened a branch in San Francisco, and later across the country, reaching territories such as Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota.[4]
In 1868, Germania became the first U.S. insurance company to start an agency in Europe. By the early 20th century, almost half its business was outside North America, until the pressures of World War I forced it to stop its business in Europe.[5]
As operations expanded, the company moved to Union Square in 1911[6] – a location that would serve as Guardian's headquarters for more than 85 years. In 1979, Guardian began to regionalize many Home Office functions, and satellite offices are now located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Appleton, Wisconsin; Spokane, Washington; and Norwell, Massachusetts.[7] In 1999, Guardian relocated to its current headquarters to 7 Hanover Square in the Financial District.[8] In April 2017 the company announced plans to move several hundred employees to Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey.[9]
Products[edit]
Dental[edit]
Guardian is the 6th largest dental provider in the US, with 6.4 million participants as of February 2015.[10] Guardian acquired First Commonwealth in 1999,[11] and acquired Premier Access in 2014,[12] and Avesis in 2016.[13]
Disability insurance[edit]
In July 2001, Guardian merged with Berkshire Life Insurance Company. As of February 2015[update] the newly formed Berkshire Life Insurance Company of America subsidiary administers all disability products for Guardian.[14]
Human resources[edit]
Guardian acquired Reed Group in 2012 and through it, provides human resources to companies dealing with employees on absence due to disability. It helps manage and administer claims related to employee absences, offers "LeavePro", a software to manage absences, and offers "MDGuidelines", a web-based tool to manage employee's return to work.[15] In 2015 they grew this business by acquiring Aon Hewitt's absence management business.[16]
Investment services[edit]
In 2006, Guardian acquired 65% of RS Investments.[17] RS provides its services to pensions, investment companies, high net worth individuals, corporations, and banks. It also has a selection of mutual funds which it offers to clients.[18] In 2007, RS Investments was one of the largest stockholders in Corrections Corporation of America, with 2,486,866 shares.[19]
In September 2016 Guardian sold their 401(k) business to Ameritas Life.[20]
Additionally, Guardian owns a full service broker-dealer Park Avenue Securities (PAS).[21] PAS was established in 1999 by Guardian.[22]
Controversies[edit]
In 2009, Guardian was the subject of controversy when, in December 2008, it cancelled the insurance plan that covered Ian Pearl, who suffers from muscular dystrophy and requires 24-hour nursing care, which costs approximately a million dollars a year. Under the federal ERISA law Guardian was obligated to continue the coverage for one year after it cancelled the plan and thus policy under the plan. Guardian offered no comparable plan to replace it, and his parents characterized the cancellation as a "death sentence." His parents sued Guardian and lost the case in October 2009, when a federal judge found that Guardian had the right to terminate the entire plan. The Pearl family appealed to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and to the media, and publicized a memo that emerged during the trial, which characterized high cost policies like the one Pearl had, as "dogs" and "trainwrecks." Guardian publicly and personally apologized to the Pearls and agreed to continue coverage for Ian and two other patients in similar situations.[23][24] Ian Pearl lives in New York State, and as a result of the controversy, New York passed "Ian's Law" that among other things, requires that insurance companies that cancel insurance plans must offer similar replacement coverage to policy holders under the cancelled plan.[24]

How we can help you












Life Insurance
When you think about the joy your loved ones bring to you, you naturally think about what you can do for them in return, not only now, but in the future. By ensuring that they’ll be provided for in the event of unexpected circumstances, you’re taking care of them no matter what. Somehow, knowing that they’re covered helps you enjoy your own life more.
Learn More About Life Insurance


Disability Income Insurance
People tend not to understand the meaning of disability, in insurance terms. It stands for protecting your standard of living in the face of all-too-common events, such as a serious illness or an accident. Don’t count on luck. It’s better to be prepared.

Annuities
Retirement with a steady source of income that you can’t outlive. Sound good? Annuities are an agreement between an insurance company and you that can help provide this income stream. They’re also an agreement with yourself to enjoy your retirement.

Money doesn’t grow on trees. So people find other ways to multiply their savings. Investing is one of the most widely used strategies for accumulating wealth. Explore some of the diverse vehicles, and consider making investing part of your financial mix.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
