Personal[edit]
Mueller grew up in a middle-class family in Wisconsin with seven siblings.[5]
Mueller married his wife, Paula, who is often by his side at university events such as concerts and basketball games. The couple has four sons; the two older attended Arizona State University and the youngest attended Grand Canyon.[6]
Mueller enjoys golf and has been golfing with his children since they were three.[7]
Grand Canyon University[edit]
The university was established in 1949 but was on the brink of closing its doors in 2004 due to millions of dollars in debt. Mueller was hired in 2008 when the university went to the public market for an infusion of capital investment to put towards the West Phoenix campus. Under Mueller's watch, the university's ground campus enrollment has jumped from about 1,000 to over 11,000 as of the fall of 2014. Enrollment in online programs is over 55,000. Mueller's goal for the ground campus is to increase enrollment to 25,000 and continue to expand the campus.[8]
Mueller finished fourth in the Phoenix Business Journal's 2014 Businessman of the Year voting behind Michael Bidwill (Arizona Cardinals), MaryAnn Guerra (BioAccel), and Bob Parsons (GoDaddy).[9]
Early career[edit]
Mueller's first job in higher education was at his alma mater, Concordia University. He was a professor at the university from 1983 to 1987 as well as the university's head men's basketball coach.

Executive Team











Brian Mueller






Brian Mueller joined Grand Canyon University (GCU) in July 2008 to usher in a new era for the institution - from an entrepreneurial venture to a market-supported private university. Taking the successes he experienced as a teacher and coach at the high school and small college level as well as his 22 years of experience at the Apollo Group (the parent company of University of Phoenix), Mr. Mueller transformed GCU from a financially troubled university into a $2 billion institution that has become a driving force in higher education today.
As the university's president and CEO, Mr. Mueller is progressive and anticipatory in an industry that is slow in adapting to change. Since Mr. Mueller joined GCU, the university has experienced unprecedented growth. Enrollment on the Phoenix campus has increased from less than 1,000 to 16,000, while online enrollment has improved from 12,500 to 55,000. Read MoreMr. Mueller has also overseen a $600 million expansion of the campus through new technologies, classrooms, laboratories, athletic facilities and student amenities, with another $200 million in improvements scheduled for the next three years.
These efforts to create a better educational environment have been accomplished at no additional cost to students or taxpayers in Arizona. By creating a hybrid education model that relies on operational efficiencies and fiscal responsibility on its ground and online campuses, Mr. Mueller has been able to freeze tuition on GCU's Phoenix campus for seven straight years.This ensures one of his highest priorities as president - that a high-quality, private, Christian education is affordable to all socioeconomic classes. GCU awards approximately $140 million in institutional aid to students every year and remains among the most affordable private universities in the country.Academically, Mr. Mueller has led a reinvention of GCU's programs, aligning the school's curriculum with high-growth fields such as computer science, information technology and engineering, among others, while continuing to produce graduates with the high character and servant leadership the university is known for. The university now has nine colleges and offers more than 160 degree programs.
Another emphasis for Mr. Mueller has been his five-point plan to revitalize west Phoenix by 1) Developing a STEM workforce that attracts businesses to the area, 2) Creating jobs for local residents, 3) Supporting K-12 education, 4) Making the surrounding neighborhood safer through a $1 million partnership with the Phoenix Police Department, and 5) Helping hundreds of homeowners in the community through a first-of-its-kind partnership with Habitat for Humanity.GCU's involvement in the community is reflected in more than 100 service projects its students and staff have embraced.Mr. Mueller's vision for Christian education draws from his own experiences as a student, teacher and coach in Christian schools. His passion is also seen in his inspiring Chapel service addresses, which draw standing-room only crowds at GCU Arena.
Prior to joining GCU, Mr. Mueller was CEO of the University of Phoenix Online, when it grew from 3,000 students to 340,000 students in an eight-year time frame. He was eventually president of the Apollo Group, where the university as a whole grew to more than 450,000 students.
Mr. Mueller began his higher education career as a teacher and coach at Concordia University. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Education and Master of Arts in Education from Concordia.
Mr. Mueller serves on a myriad of boards, including the Greater Phoenix Economic Council and Arizona Commerce Authority, and is executive director of the Joy Community Church Foundation. He has been married to his wife Paula for nearly 40 years and has four grown children who also work at GCU.














Dr. Stan Meyer

Dr. Stan Meyer joined GCU in 2008 with more than 25 years of experience in higher education. Prior to joining the university, Dr. Meyer served the Apollo Group, Inc. from 2002 through 2008, as Executive Vice President for Marketing and Enrollment, as well as Division Director for Doctoral Programs and Regional Vice President of Axia College at University of Phoenix, a subsidiary of the Apollo Group, Inc.
 Read MoreDr. Meyer previously spent 19 years in higher education serving in various administrative and academic roles throughout the Concordia University system, including admissions, enrollment, financial aid, student retention, distance education and faculty. He also serves on the board of Phoenix-based Valley Lutheran High School.
Meyer earned his Doctor of Education in Institutional Management and Master of Business Administration from Pepperdine University (California) and his Bachelor of Arts in Communications from Concordia University (Nebraska).




Dan Bachus

Dan Bachus joined GCU in 2008 and brings more than eight years of executive-level finance and leadership experience to his position. Prior to joining the university, Bachus served as Chief Financial Officer for the Loreto Bay Company (2006-2008); as the Chief Accounting Officer and Controller of Apollo Group, Inc., a for-profit, post-secondary education company and the parent company of the University of Phoenix (2000-2006); and as an audit senior manager for Deloitte & Touche LLP (1992-2000).
 Read MoreBachus earned his Bachelor of Science in Accountancy from the University of Arizona and his Master of Business Administration from the University of Phoenix. He is also a certified public accountant and serves on the Board of Directors of the Valley of the Sun Jewish Community Center.














Joe Mildenhall

Joseph N. Mildenhall has been serving as Chief Information Officer in GCU since September 2009. From 1998 to September 2009, Mr. Mildenhall was employed by Apollo Education Group, Inc., a for-profit, postsecondary education company and the parent company of the University of Phoenix, serving between June 2006 and September 2009 as its chief information officer. Read MoreFrom 1998 to 2006, Mr. Mildenhall directed the design, development and deployment of the University of Phoenix online education environment and the student and faculty Internet portal supporting the rapid growth of the online campus beginning in 1998. From 1979 to 1988, Mr. Mildenhall held increasingly responsible roles in software development at J&K Computer Systems, eventually becoming vice president and co-owner.

GCU's Mission and Vision









Vision
GCU is a premier Christian university, educating students to lead and serve.
Mission
Grand Canyon University prepares learners to become global citizens, critical thinkers, effective communicators and responsible leaders by providing an academically challenging, values-based curriculum from the context of our Christian heritage.

























Mission Explanation



Mission Explanation



Since Grand Canyon University's (GCU) founding in 1949, the University has been a faith-based institution. It is the University's position that academic quality and integrity are the primary purposes of the University as evidenced in the Mission Statement:
"Grand Canyon University prepares learners to become global citizens, critical thinkers, effective communicators, and responsible leaders by providing an academically challenging, values-based curriculum from the context of our Christian heritage."
The manifestation of the Mission throughout the institution is much deeper, so the following Mission Explanation articulates the University's purpose, values, plans, and institutional priorities featuring students at the center. These explanations demonstrate GCU's Mission application to academics, co-curricular, and community. Each competency has been expounded upon to provide a consistent understanding of the extent of these competencies:
Global Citizen: One who learns with empathy, avoiding ethnocentrism and embracing the reality that people are different with different perspectives on history, religion, value-systems, and many other aspects of life and living. Global citizenship means that by understanding others one can understand more about oneself.• Academic: Becoming global citizens entails emphasizing the value and dignity of others as well as the need to bear personal responsibility for the welfare of the larger global society in which we live. Students develop their awareness through examination of the many facets of global society, working to relate to, understand, and communicate with cultures that are different from their own. Selected artifacts in General Education and the program major demonstrate students' competency in global citizenship.• Co-curricular: The formation of global citizens begins with a campus-wide commitment to live out faith within the context of a community marked by mutual respect and concern for one another. Students learn to work together to serve the needs of the less fortunate in the surrounding community and around the world. GCU students, faculty, and staff participate in global missions to developing countries, welcome and support international students in the campus and online communities, and engage sister communities around the world when appropriate.• Community: The University is committed to modelling the responsible citizenship it expects of its student body and alumni. As a university, this calling shapes the ways we think and act within academic disciplines and within both diverse local and foreign communities. GCU's role in a multicultural society is demonstrated through discipline-specific efforts in impoverished nations, such as nursing missions, as well as the University's local efforts to positively impact the community, such as tutoring individual students and thus improving the rating of public elementary and high schools in the surrounding neighborhood.
Critical Thinker: One who works to master clarity and logic in thought by asking questions and pursuing knowledge to avoid delusion and blind acceptance of ideas, to reduce vulnerability, and to work to find solutions rather than dwell on problems.• Academic: GCU's basic strategy for developing students' critical thinking skills centers on the concept of a worldview, which refers to the complex network of assumptions that shape thought and practice. Befitting the degree level, students demonstrate their ability to think critically through analytic reasoning, critical evaluation in the curriculum, and/or synthesizing current or creating new research to promote a culture of scholarship.• Co-curricular: The University is committed to the pursuit of understanding and affirms that genuine knowledge may be derived from a wide variety of sources, including human reason and introspection, scientific investigation, and divine revelation. The University community engages in critical thinking through governance opportunities aimed at dealing with current challenges and planning for the future, participating in scholarly events meant to challenge the community's current ideas, and analyzing data for continuous improvement in student learning, operational efficiencies, student engagement, and student affairs.• Community: GCU participates in thinking critically about the role higher education institutions have in the world with regards to their effect on individual students, families' welfare, the knowledge collective, and the economy. GCU engages with regulators, the Mayor, Governor, and Arizona Legislature on higher education issues and strives to advocate for student access, choice in degrees based on traditional academia as well as current/future market conditions, and the importance of all institutional types. To support these efforts, GCU offers opportunities in which the public can engage in events that evoke critical thinking around the community and academic discourse like lecture series, competitions, and town halls. Through these venues, the University goes outside its virtual walls to create a constant exchange of information with scholarly peers, external communities, and the public.
Effective Communicator:One who works toward perfecting his or her professional communication skills, is cognizant of how communication impacts others intellectually and emotionally, and is challenged to understand and ethically employ traditional and innovative modalities.• Academic: Communication depends substantially on clarity of thought and the ability to present ideas logically and coherently. But effective communication requires a capacity to interact with others in a way that accounts for the complexities of human nature and interpersonal relationships. GCU urges students to emulate this basic strategy when engaging others' ideas and understandings. Students demonstrate their ability to effectively communicate through writing effectiveness and writing mechanics across the students' chosen program. Students use technology to demonstrate competence in mediated communication, connect globally to present an "e-self" that is sensitive to audience and context, and analyze and interpret visual rhetoric. • Co-curricular: GCU regards humility to be a crucial virtue and the appropriate starting point for effective communication. Faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to engage one another in accordance with the wisdom of the New Testament which teaches that one should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry (James 1:19). GCU provides internal community members the opportunity to participate in the governance of the University and for their respective viewpoints to be heard; ensures there are multiple channels through which the University apprises its internal constituencies of academic and operational policies, processes, and updates; and provides support through venues and resources for academic discourse.• Community: As a university, we strive to communicate the essence of the institution today and the vision of its future. GCU is committed to respectful dialogue and charitable engagement in all matters including engagement in conversation with the larger academic community by sharing ideas and best practices; to transparent communication of current status, student learning outcomes, and goal achievement of the University; and to ongoing discourse about the important role the University plays in the local and national economy as well as in the public and common good.
Responsible Leader: One who is grounded in the reality of the world, accepts the consequences of choice, and strives unselfishly to help others meet their highest potential.• Academic: The University embraces the traditional Christian conviction that education relates to the whole person and should assist individuals in finding and living with purpose. Consequently, GCU strives to produce graduates who are committed to living and leading in ways that bear a transformative influence on the families, organizations, businesses, and communities in which they are members.• Co-curricular: GCU prepares students with the knowledge, skills, and virtues necessary for service as servant leaders within their respective vocations and within the larger society. Through responsible leadership, faculty, students, and staff support each other academically, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and financially through opportunities to lead and learn in mentorship programs, living and learning communities, ministry, and health and wellness programs.• Community: In order to model responsible leadership to its students, as an institution GCU has distinguished itself in the ways it wisely manages, distributes, and employs the many resources God has provided. This can be seen in University efforts to hold tuition to affordable levels so the larger society can access higher education, to create well-paying jobs not only for students but for those in the expanded community, to care for community resources that contribute to public good, to provide opportunities for the free exchange of ideas, and to give charitably from the heart.
The Mission must be seen from the context of the Christian Heritage: • Academic: The University educates students from a distinctively Christian perspective and prepares them for careers marked by kindness, service, and integrity. Students show their understanding and expression of Christian Worldview through the General Education curriculum and student learning artifacts throughout the major.• Co-curricular: As an institution, GCU values every student and employee entrusted to its care. As a missional campus, GCU welcomes students from all walks of life to seek truth and to find their purpose in an environment shaped by Christian love and compassion. Students have rich co-curricular discussion with other students, faculty, and staff through scheduled campus ministries, services, spiritual life opportunities, and life groups; or through informal mentorships and peer relationships.• Community: The University endeavors to create an environment characterized by love for neighbors and concern for the world we live in. The internal GCU community demonstrates this commitment through local and global outreach such as student-run ministries, GCU sponsored ministries, college missions, and co-curricular opportunities.
These critical attributes have been determined to be essential to student success throughout their educational journey and after graduation; they are measured annually through GCU's Mission-Critical assessment, as well as programmatic and Co-curricular assessment initiatives. At GCU, we attend to the scriptural imperative: "If a man vows a vow to the Lord, or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth." (Numbers 30:2 ESV)

Graduates of GCU will be able to express aspects of the Christian worldview, which affect human value and dignity, ethical decision-making, academic disciplines and vocation.
"For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus." (1 Timothy 2:5)




Global Citizens

Global citizens learn with empathy, avoid ethnocentrism and embrace the reality that people are different. They appreciate a range of perspectives on history, religion, value systems and many other aspects of life. Global citizenship means that by understanding others, we learn to understand ourselves.
"The same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him." (Romans 10:12b)













Effective Communicators

Effective communicators excel in language proficiency, understand how the written word impacts others intellectually and emotionally, and are challenged to employ new venues and modes of communication.
"May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O Lord." (Psalm 19:14)




Responsible Leaders

Responsible leaders are grounded in the reality of the world, accept the consequences of choice and strive unselfishly to help others meet their highest potential through servant leadership.
"Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant." (Matthew 20:26)




Critical Thinkers

Critical thinkers work to master clarity and logic in thought. They ask questions and pursue knowledge to avoid the blind acceptance of ideas, searching for solutions rather than dwelling on problems.
"Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth." (2 Timothy 2:15)

Executive Team











Brian Mueller






Brian Mueller joined Grand Canyon University (GCU) in July 2008 to usher in a new era for the institution - from an entrepreneurial venture to a market-supported private university. Taking the successes he experienced as a teacher and coach at the high school and small college level as well as his 22 years of experience at the Apollo Group (the parent company of University of Phoenix), Mr. Mueller transformed GCU from a financially troubled university into a $2 billion institution that has become a driving force in higher education today.
As the university's president and CEO, Mr. Mueller is progressive and anticipatory in an industry that is slow in adapting to change. Since Mr. Mueller joined GCU, the university has experienced unprecedented growth. Enrollment on the Phoenix campus has increased from less than 1,000 to 16,000, while online enrollment has improved from 12,500 to 55,000. Read MoreMr. Mueller has also overseen a $600 million expansion of the campus through new technologies, classrooms, laboratories, athletic facilities and student amenities, with another $200 million in improvements scheduled for the next three years.
These efforts to create a better educational environment have been accomplished at no additional cost to students or taxpayers in Arizona. By creating a hybrid education model that relies on operational efficiencies and fiscal responsibility on its ground and online campuses, Mr. Mueller has been able to freeze tuition on GCU's Phoenix campus for seven straight years.This ensures one of his highest priorities as president - that a high-quality, private, Christian education is affordable to all socioeconomic classes. GCU awards approximately $140 million in institutional aid to students every year and remains among the most affordable private universities in the country.Academically, Mr. Mueller has led a reinvention of GCU's programs, aligning the school's curriculum with high-growth fields such as computer science, information technology and engineering, among others, while continuing to produce graduates with the high character and servant leadership the university is known for. The university now has nine colleges and offers more than 160 degree programs.
Another emphasis for Mr. Mueller has been his five-point plan to revitalize west Phoenix by 1) Developing a STEM workforce that attracts businesses to the area, 2) Creating jobs for local residents, 3) Supporting K-12 education, 4) Making the surrounding neighborhood safer through a $1 million partnership with the Phoenix Police Department, and 5) Helping hundreds of homeowners in the community through a first-of-its-kind partnership with Habitat for Humanity.GCU's involvement in the community is reflected in more than 100 service projects its students and staff have embraced.Mr. Mueller's vision for Christian education draws from his own experiences as a student, teacher and coach in Christian schools. His passion is also seen in his inspiring Chapel service addresses, which draw standing-room only crowds at GCU Arena.
Prior to joining GCU, Mr. Mueller was CEO of the University of Phoenix Online, when it grew from 3,000 students to 340,000 students in an eight-year time frame. He was eventually president of the Apollo Group, where the university as a whole grew to more than 450,000 students.
Mr. Mueller began his higher education career as a teacher and coach at Concordia University. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Education and Master of Arts in Education from Concordia.
