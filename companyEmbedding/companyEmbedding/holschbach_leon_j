CSBS Appoints Midland States Bank’s Holschbach to Bankers Advisory Board







SPRINGFIELD – The Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) recently announced the appointment of Leon J. Holschbach, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Midland States Bank, to the Bankers Advisory Board (BAB).  The BAB serves to advise and assist the CSBS Board of Directors from the perspective and experience of state-chartered banking institutions in pursuit of the organization’s goals and to provide industry input on appropriate areas of CSBS activities. Holschbach’s two-year term expires in May of 2018. The BAB’s next meeting will take place on September 12th in Forth Worth, Texas. 
“I commend the CSBS for appointing Leon to the Bankers Advisory Board,” said Bryan A. Schneider, IDFPR Secretary.  “As Vice Chairman and CEO to Illinois’ largest state-chartered bank, Leon brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to the appointment and will, undoubtedly, provide invaluable insight into how federal policies, legislation and regulation impact state-chartered banks.” 
As of March 31, 2016, Midland States Bank had assets of approximately $2.9 billion, and its Wealth Management Group had assets under administration of approximately $1.2 billion. Midland provides a full range of commercial and consumer banking products and services, merchant credit card services, trust and investment management, and insurance and financial planning services. In addition, commercial equipment leasing services are provided through Heartland Business Credit, and multi-family and healthcare facility FHA financing is provided through Love Funding, Midland’s non-bank subsidiaries. Midland has more than 80 locations across the United States.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
