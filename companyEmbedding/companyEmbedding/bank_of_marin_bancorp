COMMITTEE ON THE SHELTERLESS (COTS)
Petaluma, CA

Bank of Marin


WEALTH MANAGEMENT & TRUST SERVICES
Trust, Wills, and Healthcare Directives
As a relationship-focused bank, we put you first at every stage of life. This includes helping you navigate the complexities of establishing trusts, wills and healthcare directives. At Bank of Marin our role is to guide you at the right time, to help you answer your most pressing questions and concerns, and to anticipate your needs before they become an unnecessary burden to your family or your business.
There can be some confusion about how a trust is different from a will and who needs one. Most people need a will and a healthcare directive as part of a basic estate plan. We can help you analyze your assets to determine if the cost of creating and maintaining a trust is justified. For those who already have a trust, we can also help determine if your trust needs updating.
For more information about our services and how we can meet your needs, please contact a member of our knowledgeable Wealth Management & Trust Team.

Melanie Rempe, Negar Farrokhnia, Molly Foley


Celebrating Employee Leaders 
“Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.”
— John F. Kennedy
Bank of Marin has been a longtime supporter of local Chambers of Commerce leadership programs and recently celebrated three graduates from the year-long programs in Novato and San Rafael.
These programs include once-a-month learning sessions, group projects and field trips to learn leadership skills and network with other businesses.
Leadership Novato participant and class valedictorian Molly Foley was inspired by the places she learned about, including Hamilton Air Force Base and the Marin Museum of Contemporary Art, as well as time spent with Novato Mayor Denise Athas.
Says Molly, “I learned so many things about the town’s history and our local economy that are directly applicable to my role in community relations at the Bank.”
A graduate of the San Rafael Leadership Institute and a Relationship Officer for the Bank in San Rafael, Negar Farrokhnia was also inspired by the organizations she spent time with, including the Buck Institute and the Bay Model. “I learned a lot of leadership lessons and got to know the Marin business community much better, which will really pay off in my interactions with customers.”
Fellow San Rafael graduate and Bank of Marin Commercial Banking Officer Melanie Rempe summed up the experience for future graduates. “Go in with an open mind and embrace all that these programs have to offer. It will surprise you how much you didn’t know but should know about Marin.”

Bank of Marin Bancorp- On July 1, 2007 a bank holding company reorganization 
was completed whereby Bank of Marin Bancorp became the parent holding company for 
Bank of Marin, which was incorporated in August 1989 and opened for business in 
January 1990. On the date of the reorganization, each outstanding share of Bank 
of Marin common stock was converted into one share of Bank of Marin Bancorp common 
stock and Bank of Marin became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the holding company. 
Bank of Marin Bancorp assumed the ticker symbol BMRC, which was formerly used by 
Bank of Marin. Virtually all of the Bancorp's business is conducted through its 
sole subsidiary, Bank of Marin.

Bank of Marin Bancorp Reports Earnings of $5.2 Million




Raises Dividend Two Cents Per Share




                    	July 24, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time 
                    	



NOVATO, Calif.--(EON: Enhanced Online News)--Bank of Marin Bancorp, "Bancorp" (NASDAQ: BMRC), parent company of Bank 
      of Marin, announced earnings of $5.2 million in the second quarter of 
      2017, compared to $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $4.8 
      million in the second quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share were 
      $0.84 in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $0.74 in the prior 
      quarter and $0.79 in the same quarter last year. Earnings for the first 
      six months of 2017 totaled $9.7 million, compared to $10.5 million in 
      the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.58 and 
      $1.72 in the first six months of 2017 and 2016, respectively.
    

      “We had another strong, productive quarter,” said Russell A. Colombo, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our consistent, disciplined 
      sales management process allowed us to both expand existing 
      relationships and build new ones, which resulted in both loan and 
      deposit growth. In addition, we have strategic initiatives in place to 
      open new offices in Healdsburg and in the East Bay by the end of the 
      year. I am pleased with our excellent results and remain confident that 
      2017 will be another outstanding year for Bank of Marin."
    

      Bancorp also provided the following highlights from its operating and 
      financial performance for the second quarter of 2017:
    


        Total deposits increased $61.3 million in the second quarter to 
        $1,840.5 million. Non-interest bearing deposits represented 48.5% of 
        total deposits and the cost of total deposits for the quarter was 
        0.06%, down one basis point from March 31, 2017 and down two basis 
        points from June 30, 2016.
      

        Gross loans totaled $1,491.5 million at June 30, 2017 and increased 
        $13.9 million from $1,477.6 million at March 31, 2017. New loan volume 
        of $55.5 million in the second quarter of 2017 was $11.0 million 
        higher than the same quarter of 2016. Our current pipeline 
        approximates last year at this time, and should translate into loan 
        growth throughout the year.
      

        Excellent credit quality remains the hallmark of our culture. 
        Non-accrual loans represented 0.08% of total loans as of June 30, 
        2017. There was no provision for loan losses recorded in the quarter, 
        and a $208 thousand reversal of provision for losses on off-balance 
        sheet commitments primarily related to a decrease in unfunded 
        commitments.
      

        All capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements for a 
        well-capitalized institution. Total risk-based capital ratio for 
        Bancorp increased to 15.0% at June 30, 2017, compared to 14.7% at 
        March 31, 2017. Tangible common equity to tangible assets was 11.1% at 
        June 30, 2017, compared to 11.2% at March 31, 2017.
      

        The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share on 
        July 21, 2017, a $0.02 increase from prior quarter. This represents 
        the 49th consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Bank of 
        Marin Bancorp. The dividend is payable on August 11, 2017, to 
        shareholders of record at the close of business on August 4, 2017.
      


Loans and Credit Quality


      Second quarter loan originations totaled $55.5 million, compared to 
      $23.9 million last quarter and $44.5 million in the same quarter last 
      year. Loan payoffs for the quarter were $48.1 million, up from $32.7 
      million in the first quarter and $40.2 million in the same quarter last 
      year. The largest portion of payoffs in the current quarter came from 
      the successful completion of construction projects and the sale of 
      assets underlying other loans.
    

      Non-accrual loans totaled $1.2 million, or 0.08% of the loan portfolio 
      at both June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017, down from $2.7 million, or 
      0.19% a year ago. Classified loans totaled $29.3 million at June 30, 
      2017, compared to $30.2 million at March 31, 2017 and $20.4 million at 
      June 30, 2016. Accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days totaled $393 
      thousand at June 30, 2017, compared to $834 thousand at March 31, 2017 
      and $135 thousand a year ago.
    

      There was no provision for loan losses recorded in the second quarter of 
      2017, as the level of reserves was deemed appropriate for the portfolio, 
      consistent with the prior quarter and same quarter a year ago. Net 
      recoveries were $13 thousand in the second quarter of 2017, compared to 
      net charge-offs of $223 thousand in the prior quarter and net recoveries 
      of $59 thousand in the same quarter a year ago. The ratio of loan loss 
      reserves to loans was 1.02% at June 30, 2017, compared to 1.03% at 
      March 31, 2017 and 1.04% at June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2017, total loan 
      loss reserves to loans excluding acquired loans was 1.07%.
    

Investments


      The investment portfolio decreased $12.1 million from the prior quarter 
      to $401.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to principal paydowns 
      and maturities, partially offset by purchases of $5.3 million during the 
      second quarter. Given the interest rate environment, the Bank opted to 
      leave excess cash at the Federal Reserve Bank as a short-term investment 
      alternative.
    

Deposits


      On-balance sheet deposits increased to $1,840.5 million at June 30, 
      2017, compared to $1,779.3 million at March 31, 2017. The quarterly 
      increase was primarily due to $46.0 million in off-balance sheet funds 
      returned in the second quarter from our third party deposit networks. We 
      continue to see fluctuations from large deposit clients' seasonal cash 
      flows and the placement by existing clients of funds from asset sales 
      that will be distributed to the beneficiaries of trusts or transitioned 
      into real estate or other investments.
    

Earnings


      “The second quarter 2017 results affirm the success of our efforts to 
      grow organically,” said Tani Girton, Chief Financial Officer. “Our hard 
      work and commitment to relationship banking are also paying off, with a 
      stronger net interest margin, improved efficiency ratio, and 1.01% 
      return on assets.”
    

      Net interest income totaled $18.3 million in the second quarter of 2017, 
      compared to $17.6 million in the prior quarter. Actions by the Federal 
      Open Market Committee to increase rates in December 2016, March 2017 and 
      June 2017, have positively impacted yields on our rate sensitive 
      interest earning assets. Additionally, the increase in net interest 
      income from the prior quarter reflects slightly higher acquired loan 
      income as shown in the table below and an increase of $30.0 million in 
      average earnings assets.
    

      Net interest income of $18.3 million in the second quarter of 2017 
      increased $1.1 million from $17.2 million for the same quarter last 
      year. The increase was primarily driven by a $93.7 million increase in 
      interest earning assets. In addition, the second quarter of 2016 
      included a $312 thousand prepayment fee on the retirement of a Federal 
      Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") fixed advance. Higher yields on investment 
      securities and interest-bearing cash, and upward repricing of variable 
      rate loans also positively impacted interest income.
    

      Net interest income totaled $35.9 million in the first six months of 
      2017, compared to $35.8 million for the same period in 2016. The $121 
      thousand increase primarily relates to a $68.3 million increase in 
      average earning assets compared to June 30, 2016, a decrease in interest 
      expense resulting from a prepayment fee and interest associated with the 
      retirement of a FHLB fixed advance in June 2016 and a decline in rates 
      paid on deposits. Additionally, the higher yield on investment 
      securities and interest-bearing cash, and the upward repricing of 
      variable rate loans positively impacted interest income, partially 
      offset by a decrease of $990 thousand in acquired loan income and a 
      decline in the yield on fixed rate loans when compared to June 30, 2016.
    

      The tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.85% in the second quarter 
      of 2017, compared to 3.79% in the prior quarter and 3.77% in the same 
      quarter a year ago. The increase of six basis points in the second 
      quarter of 2017 compared to the prior quarter is primarily due to an 
      increase in the yield on earning assets and increased acquired loan 
      income.
    

      Loans acquired through the acquisition of other banks are classified as 
      purchased credit impaired ("PCI") or non-PCI loans and are recorded at 
      fair value at acquisition date. For acquired loans not considered credit 
      impaired, the level of accretion varies due to maturities and early 
      payoffs. Accretion on PCI loans fluctuates based on changes in cash 
      flows expected to be collected. Gains on payoffs of PCI loans are 
      recorded as interest income when the payoff amounts exceed the recorded 
      investment.
    

      As our acquired loans continue to pay off, we expect the accretion on 
      acquired loans to continue to decline. Accretion and gains on payoffs of 
      purchased loans recorded to interest income were as follows:

1 Accretable yield on PCI loans totaled $1.3 million, $1.4 
      million and $1.7 million at June 30, 2017, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 
      2016, respectively.
    

2 Unaccreted purchase discounts on non-PCI loans totaled $1.4 
      million, $1.6 million and $2.5 million at June 30, 2017, March 31, 2017 
      and June 30, 2016, respectively.
    

      Non-interest income totaled $2.1 million in both the first and second 
      quarter of 2017 and $2.4 million in the same quarter a year ago. The 
      decrease compared to the same quarter a year ago primarily relates to 
      $284 thousand in gains on the sale of investment securities in the 
      second quarter of 2016. Non-interest income totaled $4.2 million in the 
      first half of 2017 compared to $4.6 million for the same period of 2016. 
      The decrease primarily relates to $394 thousand in gains on the sale of 
      investment securities in the first half of 2016.
    

      Non-interest expense totaled $12.6 million in the second quarter of 
      2017, $13.0 million in the prior quarter and $12.0 million in the same 
      quarter a year ago. The decrease from the prior quarter was primarily 
      due to a reversal of the provision for losses on off-balance sheet 
      commitments. The reversal resulted from a decrease in total commitments 
      during the quarter primarily driven by the completion and pay-off of a 
      construction project, an increase in average commitment usage, and a 
      reduction of estimated loss factors. Lower personnel expense also 
      contributed to the decrease in non-interest expense from the prior 
      quarter. The decrease in 401(k) employer contribution (as maximum 
      employer match has been reached) and deferrals of loan origination 
      costs, were partially offset by an increase in salaries due to 
      additional full-time equivalent personnel and annual merit increases.
    

      The increase from the same quarter a year ago was primarily due to 
      higher salaries and benefits related to filling open positions and 
      incentive bonus, as well as higher occupancy expense and recruiting 
      fees. These increases were partially offset by the reversal of provision 
      for losses on off-balance sheet commitments (discussed above).
    

      Non-interest expense totaled $25.6 million in the first half of 2017, 
      compared to $24.0 million in the first half of 2016. The increase was 
      primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to filling open 
      positions which resulted in additional incentive bonus, stock-based 
      compensation and 401(k) employer match. The search for qualified 
      employees resulted in recruiting fees which contributed to an increase 
      in other expenses. Occupancy and equipment expense also increased 
      primarily due to higher rent and maintenance costs.

Forward-Looking Statements


      This release may contain certain forward-looking statements that are 
      based on management's current expectations regarding economic, 
      legislative, and regulatory issues that may impact Bancorp's earnings in 
      future periods. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact 
      that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They

      words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” 
      “would,” “should,” “could” or “may.” Factors that could cause future 
      results to vary materially from current management expectations include, 
      but are not limited to, general economic conditions, economic 
      uncertainty in the United States and abroad, changes in interest rates, 
      deposit flows, real estate values, costs or effects of future 
      acquisitions, competition, changes in accounting principles, policies or 
      guidelines, legislation or regulation, and other economic, competitive, 
      governmental, regulatory and technological factors (including external 
      fraud and cyber-security threats) affecting Bancorp's operations, 
      pricing, products and services. These and other important factors are 
      detailed in various securities law filings made periodically by Bancorp, 
      copies of which are available from Bancorp without charge. Bancorp 
      undertakes no obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions 
      to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events 
      or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect the

2 Excludes accruing troubled-debt restructured loans of 
          $17.0 million, $17.2 million and $19.9 million at June 30, 2017, 
          March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Excludes purchased 
          credit-impaired (PCI) loans with carrying values of $2.3 million,

          30, 2017, March 31,2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. These 
          amounts are excluded as PCI loan accretable yield interest

3 Tangible common equity to tangible assets is considered 
          to be a meaningful non-GAAP financial measure of capital adequacy 
          and is useful for investors to assess Bancorp's ability to absorb 
          potential losses. Tangible common equity includes common stock, 
          retained earnings and unrealized gain on available for sale 
          securities, net of tax, less goodwill and intangible assets of $8.8 
          million, $8.9 million and $9.3 million at June 30, 2017, March 31, 
          2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Tangible assets exclude 
          goodwill and intangible assets.

1 Interest income/expense is divided by actual number of 
          days in the period times 360 days to correspond to stated interest 
          rate terms, where applicable.
        



           
        



2 Yields on available-for-sale securities are calculated 
          based on amortized cost balances rather than fair value, as changes 
          in fair value are reflected as a component of stockholders' equity. 
          Investment security interest is earned on 30/360 day basis monthly.
        



           
        



3 Yields and interest income on tax-exempt securities and 
          loans are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis using the Federal 
          statutory rate of 35 percent.
        



           
        



4 Average balances on loans outstanding include 
          non-performing loans. The amortized portion of net loan origination 
          fees is included in interest income on loans, representing an 
          adjustment to the yield.

July 25--Bank of Marin Bancorp, the parent company of Novato-based Bank of Marin, reported earnings of $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2017, up from $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2016.
Earnings for the first six months of 2017 totaled $9.7 million, down from $10.5 million in the first half of 2016.
"We're very happy with the quarter," said Russell Colombo, chief executive of Bank of Marin. "We had solid earnings, loan and deposit growth and no loan problems."
Colombo said the bank plans to open new offices in Healdsburg and in the East Bay by the end of 2017.
Second quarter loan originations totaled $55.5 million, compared with $44.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. Loan payoffs for the quarter were $48.1 million, up from $40.2 million in the same quarter last year.
"There has been a lot of payoffs but our lenders are doing a good job of creating a lot of volume," Colombo said. "There will be payoffs because a lot of what we do is finance real estate, and real estate prices are up so properties get sold."
The bank's gross loans increased $13.9 million during the first quarter to $1.49 billion. Bank of Marin's gross loans totaled $1.47 billion in the first quarter of 2017.
In the second quarter of 2017, Bank of Marin's nonperforming loans totaled $1.2 million compared with $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2016. The bank has made no provision for loan losses so far this year.
Bank of Marin's total deposits increased $61.3 million in the second quarter to $1.84 billion. The bank's deposits in the second quarter of 2016 totaled $1.70 billion.
The bank's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 29 cents per share on July 21, an increase of two cents from the prior quarter. Bank of Marin's stock, which trades under the symbol BMRC on the Nasdaq, closed at $63.90 per share, up $1.60 per share, on Monday.

Bank of Marin Announces Resignation of Michaela Rodeno from Board of Directors

Posted July 25th, 2017 for Bank of Marin 






Printer-friendly versionRecognized for extensive wine industry knowledge and board experience
NOVATO, CA – (July 25, 2017) – Bank of Marin Bancorp (NASDAQ: BMRC), parent company of Bank of Marin, has announced the resignation of Michaela Rodeno from the Company’s Board of Directors, effective Friday, July 21, 2017.
Rodeno joined the Board in 2012 and served on the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee.
“Michaela has served Bank of Marin and its shareholders with particular distinction and her service will be greatly missed,” said Brian M. Sobel, Chairman of the Board. “She is an extraordinarily talented director and a wonderful colleague. Leaving the Board will give Michaela more time to spend with family, traveling and tending to Villa Ragazzi, the Rodeno family winery. We wish her the very best.”
During a distinguished 40-year career in the wine industry, Rodeno was Employee #2 and Vice President of Marketing at Domaine Chandon and the first CEO of St. Supery Winery – one of the industry’s very few female CEOs.
Throughout her career and into retirement, Rodeno served in leadership roles on a number of boards and advisory committees in the wine and banking industries. She also serves as an advisor to Astia, a global organization that works with and mentors scalable women-owned businesses.

Having Grown To $1 Billion In Assets As Of 
	December 31, 2008, Bank of Marin Bancorp Is Well Positioned For Growth In 
	Their Marketplace, Serving Three Counties In Northern California




Company 
	Profile:
On July 1, 2007 a bank 
	holding company reorganization was completed whereby Bank of Marin Bancorp 
	became the parent holding company for its sole subsidiary, Bank of Marin. On 
	this date each outstanding share of Bank of Marin common stock was converted 
	into one share of Bank of Marin Bancorp common stock and Bank of Marin 
	became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the holding company. Bank of Marin 
	Bancorp assumed the ticker symbol BMRC, which was formerly used by Bank of 
	Marin.

 

Bank of Marin was 
	incorporated in August 1989, received its charter from the California 
	Superintendent of Banks (now the California Department of Financial 
	Institutions) and commenced operations on January 23, 1990 with two branch 
	offices. The Bank is an insured bank under the Federal Deposit Insurance 
	Act. At the initial offering price of $10.00 per share 824,000 shares were 
	sold, primarily to residents of Marin County. Since that initial offering 
	the number of shares outstanding has changed as the result of stock splits 
	and stock dividends, stock option exercises, conversion of subordinated 
	debentures due May 2001, contribution of newly issued stock in the early 
	years of the Bank's Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan, stock issued 
	in payment of director fees and two stock repurchase plans.

 

Virtually all of the 
	Bancorp�s business is conducted through its sole subsidiary, Bank of Marin. 
	The Bank operates through twelve branch offices in Marin and southern Sonoma 
	counties, north of San Francisco, California. The Bank also has a commercial 
	loan production office in San Francisco. The Bank�s customer base is made up 
	of business and personal banking relationships from the communities near the 
	branch office locations. The Bank�s business banking focus is on small to 
	medium sized business, professionals and not-for-profit organizations.


Russell 
	A. Colombo
President, CEO and Director

Russell A. Colombo is a lifelong 
	resident of Marin County. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in 
	Agricultural Economics & Business Management from University of California, 
	Davis and an MBA in Banking & Finance from Golden Gate University. He joined 
	Bank of Marin in March 2004 as Executive Vice President and Branch 
	Administrator and was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Operating 
	Officer in July 2005. As of July 1, 2006 he assumed the position of 
	President and Chief Executive Officer. He has thirty-four years of banking 
	experience including positions as Senior Vice President and Group Manager of 
	the San Francisco office of Comerica Bank and as Senior Vice President and 
	Regional Manager during his nineteen year career with Union Bank of 
	California. He serves on the Boards of Hanna Boys Center, Marin Workforce 
	Housing Trust, and is Chair of College of Marin�s President�s Circle.

Interview conducted by: 
	Walter Banks, Publisher, CEOCFOinterviews.com, Published � May 8, 2009


CEOCFO: Mr. 
	Colombo, what is your vision for the Bank of Marin?


Mr. Colombo: �I�ve been CEO since July of 2006 and we are a 
	community bank that serves three counties in Northern California, San 
	Francisco, Marin County, which is on the other side of the Golden Gate 
	Bridge in San Francisco, and Sonoma, County which is directly north of that. 
	This community that we serve is a fairly affluent community. The medium 
	household income is about twice what the average in the state and in the 
	country as well. So we have a lot of wealth here, however in an area that 
	primarily has a very low population growth, there is a lot of accumulation 
	of wealth. Our vision as we go forward is to serve our communities and 
	continue to expand in the contiguous counties around our market. We just 
	passed a billion dollars in assets on December 31, 2008. We provide a 
	variety of services and lending facilities to consumers and small businesses 
	in our market. We do not offer residential mortgages, but other than that, 
	we offer a pretty broad array of business products and loans, such as 
	commercial real estate, commercial loans and consumer loans (such as home 
	equity loans) and other types of consumer loans. Our vision as we go forward 
	is to continue to grow and to be the dominant community bank of our market.�

 


CEOCFO: You�ve grown to a billion in assets; would you tell us 
	how you got there?


Mr. Colombo: �All of the growth for this bank since we started 
	19 years ago has been organic. We have 12 branch offices; 9 in Marin County, 
	3 in Sonoma County (Petaluma) and one loan production office, not a full 
	branch, in San Francisco. We have not made any acquisitions in our history. 
	We maintain a culture of serving our communities and giving back to the 
	communities that we serve. Our loan growth was very strong in 2008, and we 
	had 22% loan growth. Credit quality remains good. Fourth quarter wasn�t as 
	good as historical numbers, but we were still very profitable and made $2.5 
	million in the fourth quarter and for the year over $12 million. Contrary to 
	many banks theses days, we�re in very good financial condition. I look at 
	that and I think it�s a function that we stayed pretty true to our 
	communities and did not venture into other areas looking for growth. It 
	served us well because there�s not a lot of big residential development here 
	in Marin county, so we haven�t had the problems that so many communities 
	have had with sub-prime mortgages and the over building of single family 
	homes.�

 


CEOCFO: Are you still considered a de novo?


Mr. Colombo: �We were de novo back in 1990. As a $1 billion 
	bank, while it�s relatively small to the big banks in our market, we are the 
	largest community bank.�

 


CEOCFO: What are your plans for future growth?


Mr. Colombo: �When we look at growth, we look at it from three 
	perspectives. We have been working really hard to expand our product 
	offerings to our small business clients. We have a very strong presence in 
	this community and we�re trying to expand the product offerings so that we 
	can expand the services that we provide them and continue to build that 
	market share. Secondly, we�re focused on growing our market share in Marin 
	County and Sonoma by developing new businesses and taking market share from 
	our competitors. Thirdly, we�re looking at expanding outside of our market. 
	Our San Francisco loan production office was our first venture outside of 
	our existing footprint and now we�re expanding that office to grow our 
	business development efforts in East Bay, so that we build our commercial 
	banking activity. We think it is important to build our commercial banking 
	activities because that grows the core deposit base of the bank which is our 
	real strength. About 25% of our deposits are in demand deposits and that 
	really is the value of our franchise.�

 


CEOCFO: Is your focus more on commercial or consumer at this 
	point?


Mr. Colombo: �We�re more of a commercial bank, but we like to 
	consider ourselves as a community bank. When you look at deposits in Marin 
	County, on the business side we have about 25% market share and on the 
	consumer side, it�s much less. Our total market share deposits are about 
	10%. We have built the bank by serving the small business man and the 
	consumer growth has really been a function of that. In other words, we bank 
	the individuals who have businesses. It starts out more as a business bank, 
	but we also offer many consumer products other than residential mortgages.�

 


CEOCFO: You mentioned that you are in a wealth growth area; 
	has the economic downturn affected the bank of Marin?


Mr. Colombo: �It certainly has affected us. While this county 
	is more resilient than most, it certainly has been impacted. The retail 
	sales are down and the unemployment is up, but relative to other 
	communities, it�s not nearly as bad. When I think of that, I look at the 
	fact that there hasn�t been a lot of new residential development in markets, 
	which has been a catalyst for all of the problems. In areas like Sacramento, 
	where there is huge residential development, they have problems, which 
	causes commercial real estate problems. We do a lot of commercial real 
	estate lending, but we are in markets that are relatively mature, so you 
	don�t� have the kind of problems that come with the high growth, new 
	development areas. Therefore, we�ve been impacted relatively less than the 
	rest of the country; this county is in pretty good shape.�

 


CEOCFO: Did you participate in the Tarp funding?


Mr. Colombo: �Yes, we chose to participate in the Tarp 
	funding, but have already repurchased the $28 million in preferred stock 
	that was originally issued. When we received the Tarp funding we were - and 
	still are - a very healthy bank and only had to leverage that twice in order 
	for it to be EPS neutral. The reality was we received our funding on 
	December 5th and by December 31st we had lent out 
	$27.1 million. At that time we viewed the program as an opportunity for a 
	good bank to increase capital and leverage that capital with more lending to 
	the communities we serve. We didn�t take it because we needed it. But the 
	rules of the TARP program changed, and we felt it would negatively impact 
	our customers, shareholders, and employees and overall how we run our 
	organization as an independent business. 

We are still a very 
	healthy, stable bank and well capitalized with a Risk-Based Capital Ratio 
	exceeding the regulatory standard for a �Well Capitalized� institution.
	

 


CEOCFO: Capitalization is key for banks.


Mr. Colombo: �We clearly are not leveraged as high as the 
	investment banks and we have not taken the risky portfolio positions that 
	the investment banks do. We have a very well diversified loan portfolio. Our 
	credit under writing is very conservative and has been consistently applied 
	over the years. We�ve had very high capital ratio and we decided that this 
	would be a good opportunity to expand that capital ratio. At a 14% capital 
	ratio, we are in a pretty good position to weather even more significant 
	downturn than we�ve had thus far. We thought that was important to protect 
	our shareholders and to protect the organization even if there are problems. 
	However, if there weren�t, we have a lot of capital to grow the bank even 
	further. Clearly, we�ve gone over a billion dollars with a very significant 
	loan growth in 2008 and we�re anticipating that 2009 will continue that 
	trend.�

 


CEOCFO: Would you ever consider making acquisitions as a part 
	of your growth strategy?


Mr. Colombo: �The bank has never made an acquisition, however, 
	if an opportunity came along that would enhance our franchise, we would 
	certainly consider it. We keep our eyes open and it�s not like we would 
	never do it. We would not make an acquisition however that jumped over a 
	market or was not contiguous of existing markets.�

 


CEOCFO: What would you say sets you apart and gives you an 
	edge on you competition with both the smaller community banks and the larger 
	community banks in your area?


Mr. Colombo: �I think the real edge is with being a community 
	bank. The businesses that are located in this area can come to us and 
	actually deal with bankers that take the time to understand the business and 
	provide a service level that the bigger banks can�t and won�t do. We�re part 
	of this community, so we collect deposits from our markets and then we 
	reinvest in our communities. We�re not collecting deposits in Marin and 
	lending in Sacramento; we�re keeping it local. On top of that, we have a 
	very high level of service and we�re a high touch bank. That means better 
	communication with our customers, and that�s what�s important. When 
	customers have problems, they want a bank that has taken the time to 
	understand what they do. Another advantage is that from a structural 
	standpoint, we are very well capitalized. As I talked about, the real value 
	of our franchise is our core deposit ratio. We have 25% in demand deposits 
	and when you add savings and Now Accounts to that, over 40% of our funding 
	is in either no interest or very low interest accounts. Our cost of funds in 
	total is just over 1% and our net interest margin is 5.35%, so that�s a 
	tremendous advantage over our competition.�

 


CEOCFO: Do you have the products that you feel are necessary 
	for what your customers are asking for, or are there products that you think 
	you�ll be adding?


Mr. Colombo: �The last couple of years we have been focusing 
	on bringing on the kind of products that our business customers need. We 
	brought on remote deposit capture, positive pay, and automated lock box, and 
	we�ve wrapped all of our business offering into a product offering that we 
	call BAM, which is Business Account Management. Our cash management products 
	are up to date. Our business internet banking is top quality. We�re able to 
	go to our clients and offer the same types of services that they would get 
	from a bigger bank with a much higher level of service. What we want to do 
	is to focus on building loyalty with our clients and having them understand 
	the value proposition that we offer versus banking with some other 
	organization.�

 


CEOCFO: In closing, why should potential investors put Bank of 
	Marin Bancorp on their radar and would you ever consider going to the street 
	for funding?


Mr. Colombo: 
	�We are a public company and we are traded on Nasdaq Capital Markets. We 
	have about 5.2 million shares outstanding. We�re trading currently about 
	just over book. For a bank like ours, our multiple is 8 � times earnings, 
	which is pretty low, but financials in general are being dragged down by all 
	of the mess that is going on. I personally think that we have a very strong 
	market niche and if you look historically, the trading values for banks like 
	ours are a a lot higher than we are currently trading. If you look at our 
	organization, the fundamentals are very good, conservative underwriting, 
	high core deposit ratio, a good diversification of loans, no residential 
	mortgages and not a lot of borrowing. Most of our funding is deposit based 
	as opposed to the borrowing a lot of money from the Federal Home Loan Bank. 
	We have a product called CDARS, which is a deposit product where we offer 
	CDs that you can have FDIC insurance up to $50 million. Technically, that�s 
	called a brokered deposit, but it�s all with our customers and we don�t do 
	other brokered deposits. We�re gathering deposits in our market and lending 
	them out in these markets and that�s a key strength. We have such a strong 
	deposit base that the chances of a liquidity crisis, which in my view is a 
	big risk for some banks that borrow a lot of money, is very low and we have 
	managed that pretty well. Overall, we have a very bright future because of 
	the fundamentals of our business.�

Bank of Marin Bancorp Reports Earnings of $4.5 Million

                            Company Release - 4/24/2017 8:00 AM ET




Announces 48th Consecutive Quarterly Cash Dividend

    NOVATO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Bank of Marin Bancorp, "Bancorp" (NASDAQ:BMRC), parent company of Bank
      of Marin, announced earnings of $4.5 million in the first quarter of
      2017, compared to $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $5.6
      million in the first quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share were
      $0.74 in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $0.93 in both the prior
      quarter and the same quarter last year.
    

      “The Bank continues to operate at a very high level,” said Russell A.
      Colombo, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Disciplined
      fundamentals are the key to remaining consistently successful over the
      years, with a focus on long-term profitability. We will stay true to our
      mission and our markets, and invest in the strategic initiatives we have
      developed to grow in those markets and build the value of the franchise.”
    

      The Bank is investing in a number of strategic initiatives. This summer
      we will be opening a new branch office in Healdsburg, California, which
      will stretch our footprint north and help us solidify our presence in a
      vibrant and growing market. We will also be expanding our geographic
      reach by adding a commercial banking office in the East Bay, which
      continues to be one of the strongest growth markets in the Bay Area
      region.
    

      Bancorp also provided the following highlights from its operating and
      financial performance for the first quarter of 2017:
    


        Total deposits increased $6.6 million in the first quarter to $1,779.3
        million. Non-interest bearing deposits represent 49.4% of total
        deposits, and the cost of total deposits dropped one basis point to
        0.07%, from both the prior quarter and the first quarter of 2016.
      

        Gross loans decreased $9.0 million and totaled $1,477.6 million at
        March 31, 2017, compared to $1,486.6 million at December 31, 2016. New
        loan volume of $23.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 was $5.2
        million lower than the same quarter of 2016. The pipeline is
        considerably stronger than at this time last year, which should
        translate into loan growth throughout the year.
      

        All capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements for a
        well-capitalized institution. Total risk-based capital ratio for
        Bancorp was 14.7% at March 31, 2017 compared to 14.3% at December 31,
        2016. Tangible common equity to tangible assets increased to 11.2% at
        March 31, 2017 from 11.0% at December 31, 2016.
      

        The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.27 per share on
        April 21, 2017. This represents the 48th consecutive
        quarterly dividend paid by Bank of Marin Bancorp. The dividend is
        payable on May 12, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of
        business on May 5, 2017.
      


Loans and Credit Quality


      First quarter loan originations totaled $23.9 million versus $29.1
      million in the same quarter last year. Loan payoffs for the quarter were
      $32.7 million, down from $37.3 million the same quarter last year. The
      largest portion of payoffs came from the successful completion of
      construction projects and sales of other assets. The commercial
      financing market continues to be competitive in general, but rate
      compression seems to be stabilizing as the prospect of an increasing
      rate environment becomes more prevalent. Consumer loans received a $7.9
      million boost in the quarter from Tenants in Common ("TIC") loans, a
      highly specialized product we offer that continues to perform well as an

      Non-accrual loans totaled $1.2 million, or 0.08% of Bank of Marin's loan
      portfolio at March 31, 2017, compared to $0.1 million, or 0.01%, at
      December 31, 2016 and $2.7 million, or 0.18% a year ago. A well secured
      $1.1 million commercial real estate loan with a low loan-to-value ratio
      was placed on non-accrual status during the first quarter of 2017.
      Classified loans increased $10.6 million to $30.2 million at March 31,
      2017, up from $19.6 million at December 31, 2016. One relationship of
      $9.6 million and the non-accrual loan of $1.1 million previously
      mentioned were downgraded to substandard in the first quarter of 2017.
      Accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days totaled $834 thousand at March 31,
      2017, compared to $410 thousand at December 31, 2016 and $584 thousand a
      year ago.
    

      There was no provision for loan losses recorded in the first quarters of
      2017 and 2016 as the level of reserves is deemed appropriate for the
      portfolio, compared to a reversal of provision for loan losses of $300
      thousand in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs were $223
      thousand in the first quarter of 2017, compared to net recoveries of $29
      thousand in the prior quarter and the same quarter a year ago. The ratio
      of loan loss reserves to loans was 1.03% at March 31, 2017, compared to
      1.04% at both December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016. At March 31, 2017,
      total loan loss reserves to loans excluding acquired loans was 1.09%.
    

Investments


      The investment portfolio totaled $414.0 million at March 31, 2017, a
      decrease of $3.1 million from December 31, 2016. Effective February 24,
      2017, $129 million of mortgage-backed securities were transferred from
      available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity at fair value to
      reduce balance sheet volatility. Our strong liquidity position made this
      possible.
    

Deposits


      On-balance-sheet deposits totaled $1,779.3 million at March 31, 2017,
      compared to $1,772.7 million at December 31, 2016. The normal business
      activity of our customers produced $61.4 million in non-interest bearing
      deposit growth during the quarter. Excess liquidity of $46.0 million was
      converted to one-way money market deposit sales with our third party
      deposit networks, limiting deposit growth to $6.6 million, which
      otherwise would have been $52.6 million.
    

Earnings


      “Historically, first quarter loan growth is slower than the rest of the
      year. We continue to see a strong flow of commercial lending
      opportunities, but we can't fully control the timing of loan closings,”
      said Tani Girton, Chief Financial Officer. “With a strong pipeline and
      credit quality that remains at the top of our peer group, we are looking
      forward to a continuation of the success that Bank of Marin has shown
      for 27 years. Our strong capital and low cost deposit base position us
      well for the future.”
    

      Net interest income totaled $17.6 million in the first quarter of 2017,
      compared to $18.0 million in the prior quarter and $18.6 million in the
      same quarter a year ago. The decrease from earlier quarters was
      primarily due to a decline in gains on early payoffs of acquired loans
      and purchased loan accretion as shown in the table below. In addition,
      there were fewer days in the first quarter of 2017. These variances were
      partially offset by an increase in the yield on investment securities in
      the first quarter of 2017. Finally, average earning assets were higher
      in 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, while interest expense
      was lower as a result of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") fixed rate
      advance prepayment last year.
    

      The tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.79% in the first quarter of
      2017, compared to 3.78% in the prior quarter and 4.04% in the same
      quarter a year ago. The minimal increase in the first quarter of 2017,
      compared to the prior quarter, reflects the changes discussed above. As
      presented in the table below, there were no gains on payoffs of
      purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans in the first quarter of this
      year compared to $287 thousand, or six basis points impact on the net
      interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was offset
      by increases in the yield on investment securities and average loan
      balances.
    

      Loans acquired through the acquisition of other banks are classified as
      PCI or non-PCI loans and are recorded at fair value at acquisition date.
      For acquired loans not considered credit impaired, the level of
      accretion varies due to maturities and early payoffs. Accretion on PCI
      loans fluctuates based on changes in cash flows expected to be
      collected. Gains on payoffs of PCI loans are recorded as interest income
      when the payoff amounts exceed the recorded investment. PCI loans
      totaled $2.9 million at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and
      $2.8 million at March 31, 2016, respectively.
    

      As our acquired loans continue to pay off, we expect the accretion on
      acquired loans to continue to decline. Accretion and gains on payoffs of
      purchased loans recorded to interest income were as follows:

1 Accretable yield on PCI loans totaled $1.4 million,
            $1.5 million and $1.7 million at March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016
            and March 31, 2016, respectively.
          





2 Unaccreted purchase discounts on non-PCI loans
            totaled $1.6 million, $1.8 million and $2.8 million at March 31,
            2017, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.
          




      Non-interest income in the first quarter of 2017 totaled $2.1 million,
      compared to $2.5 million in the prior quarter and $2.2 million in the
      same quarter a year ago. The decrease compared to the prior quarter
      primarily relates to a $347 thousand special cash dividend paid on FHLB
      stock and $31 thousand in gains on the sale of investment securities in
      the fourth quarter of 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an
      increase in fees collected on one-way deposit sales placed with third
      party deposit networks in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease from
      the same quarter last year is partially due to a $110 thousand gain on
      the sale of securities in the first quarter of 2016 and lower wealth
      management and trust services fees in 2017, partially offset by an
      increase of $63 thousand in cash dividends on FHLB stock and $37
      thousand in fees collected on one-way deposit sales this year.
    

      Non-interest expense totaled $13.0 million in the first quarter of 2017,
      $11.8 million in the prior quarter and $12.0 million in the same quarter
      a year ago. The increase from both the fourth quarter and the first
      quarter of 2016 was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits
      related to filling open positions, an increase in 401(k) matching, and
      implementation of the new accounting rule for stock-based compensation.
      In addition, a provision of $165 thousand for off-balance sheet
      commitments was recorded in the first quarter of 2017, as a result of
      the increase in classified loans.

          retained earnings and unrealized gain on available for sale
          securities, net of tax, less goodwill and intangible assets of $8.9

1 Interest income/expense is divided by actual number of
          days in the period times 360 days to correspond to stated interest
          rate terms, where applicable.
        



2 Yields on available-for-sale securities are calculated
          based on amortized cost balances rather than fair value, as changes
          in fair value are reflected as a component of stockholders' equity.
          Investment security interest is earned on 30/360 day basis monthly.
        



3 Yields and interest income on tax-exempt securities and
          loans are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis using the Federal
          statutory rate of 35 percent.
        



4 Average balances on loans outstanding include
          non-performing loans. The amortized portion of net loan origination
          fees is included in interest income on loans, representing an
          adjustment to the yield.

Bank of Marin


WEALTH MANAGEMENT & TRUST SERVICES
Trust, Wills, and Healthcare Directives
As a relationship-focused bank, we put you first at every stage of life. This includes helping you navigate the complexities of establishing trusts, wills and healthcare directives. At Bank of Marin our role is to guide you at the right time, to help you answer your most pressing questions and concerns, and to anticipate your needs before they become an unnecessary burden to your family or your business.
There can be some confusion about how a trust is different from a will and who needs one. Most people need a will and a healthcare directive as part of a basic estate plan. We can help you analyze your assets to determine if the cost of creating and maintaining a trust is justified. For those who already have a trust, we can also help determine if your trust needs updating.
For more information about our services and how we can meet your needs, please contact a member of our knowledgeable Wealth Management & Trust Team.

Celebrating Employee Leaders 
“Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other.”
— John F. Kennedy
Bank of Marin has been a longtime supporter of local Chambers of Commerce leadership programs and recently celebrated three graduates from the year-long programs in Novato and San Rafael.
These programs include once-a-month learning sessions, group projects and field trips to learn leadership skills and network with other businesses.
Leadership Novato participant and class valedictorian Molly Foley was inspired by the places she learned about, including Hamilton Air Force Base and the Marin Museum of Contemporary Art, as well as time spent with Novato Mayor Denise Athas.
Says Molly, “I learned so many things about the town’s history and our local economy that are directly applicable to my role in community relations at the Bank.”
A graduate of the San Rafael Leadership Institute and a Relationship Officer for the Bank in San Rafael, Negar Farrokhnia was also inspired by the organizations she spent time with, including the Buck Institute and the Bay Model. “I learned a lot of leadership lessons and got to know the Marin business community much better, which will really pay off in my interactions with customers.”
Fellow San Rafael graduate and Bank of Marin Commercial Banking Officer Melanie Rempe summed up the experience for future graduates. “Go in with an open mind and embrace all that these programs have to offer. It will surprise you how much you didn’t know but should know about Marin.”
