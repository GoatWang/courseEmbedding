What people are saying about Quell



reviews


Quell Has Been Near-Miraculous for Me

I had been suffering from extreme neuropathic pain. My neuropathy resulted from physical injury that caused permanent damage to the nerves in my feet. Since using Quell, I have had absolutely no significant discomfort or pain. My mobility is also vastly improved. This is a fantastic product that is destined to change the lives of millions who suffer from chronic pain. It has truly resulted in a major change for the better in the quality of my life.

 - Hawkeye


Overrides Pain Signals

My Quell was easy to calibrate and position on my calf. My chronic back pain seemed to blur down in intensity. After about two weeks of daily wear, the pain relief was unbelievable. I wear it constantly even when wearing skirts and heels. The real test came the day I forgot to put it on and had a difficult time getting through my normal routine. For non-medicated chronic pain relief, there is nothing more effective than Quell.
 - “Amazon Customer”


So Happy I Found It!

Two years ago, I had my spine fused from top to bottom with 2 rods and 35 screws, and I’ve had nothing but intense pain ever since. I am on several different pain meds and sleeping has been a real struggle. Since Quell, I have been able to get off one of the major pain meds. I use Quell mainly for sleeping and have gone from 6 hours sleep to 8-9 hours. I have even been able to start doing some cooking again. This device really works well for me.

I Love My Quell!

I’ve suffered from chronic pain since a terrible car wreck almost three years ago. I was crushed from the sternum down. I learned to walk again and my body is full of implanted metal to help rebuild my bones. My right leg is worse than my left and hurts 24/7. My favorite time to wear Quell is while sleeping. It distracts my brain from pain and helps me sleep better. Since the wreck, I’ve been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis all over my body. 
 - Megan


Quell Has Changed My Life – No Exaggeration

“I suffer from fibromyalgia, which unlike other pain conditions doesn’t respond well to pain medication…I take at least half the OTC pain medicine, have more energy, sleep much better, ache less…, and feel happier than in a long time.”
 - April


He Simply Lost Hope Until Quell

For two years, my husband was in severe pain due to nerve damage from shingles. His pain was excruciating … Within one hour of starting Quell, his pain went from an 8 to a very mild 1. He is happy and slowly returning to the person his family loves!
 - Lindy

Quell Has Lived Up to Its Promises

I am always skeptical about any product that claims drug-free pain relief, but Quell has lived up to its promises and even exceeded them for me. Since I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis, my sleep each night had steadily decreased due to the pain in my hips and knees. From the first night I wore Quell to bed, I was finally able to once more sleep through the night, and this has made an enormous difference in my energy and state of mind. 

              - Anthony            


It’s a Miracle!

My mom suffers from stenosis, sciatica, and neuropathy-type pain. She is unable to take any pain medication. She has had two epidural steroid injections, which has helped but didn’t totally remove her pain. Within two days of trying Quell, she was back to her normal energetic self and pain-free. I have contacted everyone I know who suffers from chronic pain. Thank you Quell for giving me my mom back!!!

              - Marian            


Excellent for Diabetic Foot Pain

I have both sciatica and diabetic foot pain. Before Quell, I could not even stand to have a sheet touch my foot. Now the night pains are completely gone and I can get to sleep a lot easier. I would highly recommend this device for anyone with foot/toe pain.

              - Ken

Quell® Wearable Pain Relief Quell is an FDA cleared, over-the-counter wearable therapeutic device for chronic pain. Always worn on the upper calf, Quell taps into the body’s natural pain response system to provide widespread pain relief. Quell combines advanced neurotechnology in a wearable format with a sophisticated app for users to personalize and control therapy while tracking their pain and relevant health metrics.
READ MORE
Quell is a 100% drug free wearable designed to provide widespread relief for the millions of people suffering with chronic pain (an estimated one in three Americans). Using advanced neurotechnology, Quell stimulates sensory nerves, tapping into the body’s pain response system. Sensory nerves carry neural pulses to the brain which trigger a natural response that blocks pain signals, leading to widespread pain relief.
Quell is the only device of its kind that is FDA cleared for use while sleeping – an especially critical feature for those living with chronic pain who often lose sleep, creating a vicious cycle that affects them into the following day. Users have the option to personalize and manage their therapy discreetly via the Quell companion smartphone app, which offers therapy utilization and advanced sleep tracking. Quell offers those living with chronic pain another option to treat their condition without introducing a co-pay or prescription. With Quell, those living with chronic pain are empowered to reclaim their lives. Quell is available online at QuellRelief.com, through select healthcare professionals and retailers.

Quell Has Been Near-Miraculous for Me

I had been suffering from extreme neuropathic pain. My neuropathy resulted from physical injury that caused permanent damage to the nerves in my feet. Since using Quell, I have had absolutely no significant discomfort or pain. My mobility is also vastly improved. This is a fantastic product that is destined to change the lives of millions who suffer from chronic pain. It has truly resulted in a major change for the better in the quality of my life.

 - Hawkeye


Overrides Pain Signals

My Quell was easy to calibrate and position on my calf. My chronic back pain seemed to blur down in intensity. After about two weeks of daily wear, the pain relief was unbelievable. I wear it constantly even when wearing skirts and heels. The real test came the day I forgot to put it on and had a difficult time getting through my normal routine. For non-medicated chronic pain relief, there is nothing more effective than Quell.
 - “Amazon Customer”


So Happy I Found It!

Two years ago, I had my spine fused from top to bottom with 2 rods and 35 screws, and I’ve had nothing but intense pain ever since. I am on several different pain meds and sleeping has been a real struggle. Since Quell, I have been able to get off one of the major pain meds. I use Quell mainly for sleeping and have gone from 6 hours sleep to 8-9 hours. I have even been able to start doing some cooking again. This device really works well for me.

I Love My Quell!

I’ve suffered from chronic pain since a terrible car wreck almost three years ago. I was crushed from the sternum down. I learned to walk again and my body is full of implanted metal to help rebuild my bones. My right leg is worse than my left and hurts 24/7. My favorite time to wear Quell is while sleeping. It distracts my brain from pain and helps me sleep better. Since the wreck, I’ve been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis all over my body. 
 - Megan


Quell Has Changed My Life – No Exaggeration

“I suffer from fibromyalgia, which unlike other pain conditions doesn’t respond well to pain medication…I take at least half the OTC pain medicine, have more energy, sleep much better, ache less…, and feel happier than in a long time.”
 - April


He Simply Lost Hope Until Quell

For two years, my husband was in severe pain due to nerve damage from shingles. His pain was excruciating … Within one hour of starting Quell, his pain went from an 8 to a very mild 1. He is happy and slowly returning to the person his family loves!

Quell Has Lived Up to Its Promises

I am always skeptical about any product that claims drug-free pain relief, but Quell has lived up to its promises and even exceeded them for me. Since I was diagnosed with osteoarthritis, my sleep each night had steadily decreased due to the pain in my hips and knees. From the first night I wore Quell to bed, I was finally able to once more sleep through the night, and this has made an enormous difference in my energy and state of mind. 

              - Anthony            


It’s a Miracle!

My mom suffers from stenosis, sciatica, and neuropathy-type pain. She is unable to take any pain medication. She has had two epidural steroid injections, which has helped but didn’t totally remove her pain. Within two days of trying Quell, she was back to her normal energetic self and pain-free. I have contacted everyone I know who suffers from chronic pain. Thank you Quell for giving me my mom back!!!

              - Marian            


Excellent for Diabetic Foot Pain

I have both sciatica and diabetic foot pain. Before Quell, I could not even stand to have a sheet touch my foot. Now the night pains are completely gone and I can get to sleep a lot easier. I would highly recommend this device for anyone with foot/toe pain.

              - Ken
