Item #: MPR-414F-PA


		The MPR Series Biomedical Refrigerator and Freezer Combinations from Panasonic are designed for specific vaccine and biological storage applications, making them ideal for clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, clinical labs, and medical offices. The MPR-414F-PA combines high performance refrigeration with advanced control and alarm monitoring systems as well as energy efficient and cost-effective cabinet design. All housed within one unit, the refrigerator uses fan-forced air circulation (cycle defrost) to keep the inner refrigerated cabinet at an average temperature of +4°C while the freezer uses direct cooling (manual defrost) to cool the inner freezer cabinet down to temperatures as low as -30°C. This space-saving refrigerator with freezer features two separate compressors (one for each section), a microprocessor controller, two access ports (one for each section), casters, remote alarm contacts, and key locks. The MPR Series Biomedical Refrigerator and Freezer Combos have all the right features for even the strictest applications including: advanced temperature controls, precise uniformity, temperature stability, energy savings, and accurate alarms and monitoring.
