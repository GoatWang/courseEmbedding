What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

LLC Pricing Packages - Affordable LLC Formation Services from LegalZoomWhen you decided to form an LLC, one of your first questions may have been "how much does an LLC cost"? Fortunately, LegalZoom makes the process of starting an LLC affordable and simple. With three LLC pricing packages to choose from, there is a package to fit the needs of any business. The Economy package LLC cost includes filing of the document forming the LLC with the state, a personalized operating agreement, name availability check, a financial account authorization letter, and a 30 business day turnaround. Standard package LLC fees include everything from the Economy package with a 15 business day turnaround, plus a company seal and binder, and 20 customized membership certificates. The Express Gold LLC formation package includes everything from the Standard package with a 7-10 business day turnaround, plus a Federal Tax ID (EIN) (discounted and expedited), a tax consultation with 1-800Accountant, and a 30-day trial of attorney advice. Get started forming an LLC by answering a few questions about your business. We'll assemble your LLC documents and file them directly with the appropriate state agency and you'll receive your completed LLC package by mail. The LLC price for all packages includes a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a Peace of Mind Review.

The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is

please contact us immediately upon placing an order so that we can submit the filing with
the name reservation attached to the articles of formation.

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

LLC Pricing Packages - Affordable LLC Formation Services from LegalZoomWhen you decided to form an LLC, one of your first questions may have been "how much does an LLC cost"? Fortunately, LegalZoom makes the process of starting an LLC affordable and simple. With three LLC pricing packages to choose from, there is a package to fit the needs of any business. The Economy package LLC cost includes filing of the document forming the LLC with the state, a personalized operating agreement, name availability check, a financial account authorization letter, and a 30 business day turnaround. Standard package LLC fees include everything from the Economy package with a 15 business day turnaround, plus a company seal and binder, and 20 customized membership certificates. The Express Gold LLC formation package includes everything from the Standard package with a 7-10 business day turnaround, plus a Federal Tax ID (EIN) (discounted and expedited), a tax consultation with 1-800Accountant, and a 30-day trial of attorney advice. Get started forming an LLC by answering a few questions about your business. We'll assemble your LLC documents and file them directly with the appropriate state agency and you'll receive your completed LLC package by mail. The LLC price for all packages includes a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a Peace of Mind Review.







1After the 30-day trial period, benefits to the Business Legal Plan (also Business Advantage Pro or Business Advisory Plan) continue automatically at the plan rate (currently $39.99 per month). Cancel by calling (877) 818-8787. For full details, see the Legal Plan Contract and Subscription Terms.2Some restrictions apply. For full details, see our Legal Plan Contract and Subscription Terms for details. Any product discounts are applied at checkout.3Pricing does not include post-formation requirements such as annual report fees, statement of officers fees or taxes. Please see the LLC Knowledge Center for examples of these fees. You may also contact the state, an accountant or LegalZoom for more information about these fees.4Once your LLC becomes legally effective, your card will automatically be charged $159.00. Service renews annually thereafter for the same fee until canceled. For full terms and conditions, click here. ** Does not include required newspaper publication fee.
