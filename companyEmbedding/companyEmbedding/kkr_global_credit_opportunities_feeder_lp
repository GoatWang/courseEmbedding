PHC completes acquisition of medical devices business from Bayer. Gains global sales channels, opportunities for business beyond diabetes Nikkei Sangyo Shimbun

	This month, major medical devices manufacturer Panasonic Healthcare Holdings closed its acquisition of Bayer Diabetes Care. PHC has for many years provided Bayer with medical equipment as an OEM and through this acquisition has established a unified manufacturing and sales framework. The deal also gives PHC access to global sales channels and could lead to expansion beyond blood glucose monitoring systems. In less than two years since its acquisition by a U.S. investment fund, Panasonic Healthcare has embarked on a new growth phase.

	The team that led Bayer's diabetes equipment business expressed their appreciation of Panasonic Healthcare President & CEO Hidehito Kotani at the end of 2015, saying, "We're delighted that we have finally come together." Mr. Kotani commented that the deal "Feels like getting married to a long-term partner. The integration will be smooth."

	Through the carve-out, PHC is acquiring Bayer's diabetes equipment business unit worldwide for approximately 132 billion yen. Bayer's unit is number 3 globally with a 15% share of the market. The addition of PHC's share brings this to 20%. Mr. Kotani commented that his goal is the "top share."

	Bayer launched its diabetes equipment business in 1969 and began selling PHC's blood glucose meters in 1991. The majority of blood glucose meters sold by the company in about 125 countries are manufactured by PHC.

	The central theme of the acquisition is "integration of manufacture and sales." According to Mr. Kotani, "Until now, our ability to hear customer feedback directly and leverage this in the development of new products has been insufficient. By integrating development, manufacturing, and sales we can increase the speed of product development and get our products to patients more quickly.

	Access to Bayer's sales channels is significant. Through the acquisition, Ascensia Diabetes comes under the PHC umbrella, bringing with it 35 local affiliates in 34 countries, including the U.S., Germany, and France.

	Preparation is now underway to establish offices in Saudi Arabia, The UAE, Kuwait, and Egypt. Mr. Kotani said that he hopes to take advantage of these sales channels to expand sales to diagnostic equipment beyond diabetes.

	The presence of U.S. investment fund KKR, which owns 80% of PHC, was a major factor in this large acquisition where the price exceeded PHC's own annual sales.

	Panasonic sold PHC to KKR in March 2014 as part of its structural reforms to address deteriorating business performance. Reflecting on the Bayer deal, Mr. Kotani said that "Without KKR's global experience in corporate carve outs, this acquisition from Bayer wouldn't have happened."

	The deal gives PHC annual sales in the region of 200 billion yen and places it among the top medical equipment manufacturers in Japan. With plans to relist in the future, observers will now want to know how the deal will bring concrete synergies for PHC.

KKR Income Opportunities Fund seeks to dynamically allocate across credit instruments to capitalize on changes in relative value among corporate credit investments and manage against macroeconomic risks. The Fund is designed to offer investors:

Investment experience of KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, the Fund’s investment adviser, which is a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., a leading global investment firm with a 40-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence
Potential for attractive levels of current income through monthly distributions
A targeted portfolio investing primarily in bank loans and high yield securities
KKR Credit's consistent approach and robust credit investment process that seeks to adapt credit strategies to market conditions

KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC serves as KKR Income Opportunities Fund’s investment adviser (the “Adviser”). Launched in 2004, the Adviser is a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (together with the Adviser and its other affiliates, “KKR”). The Adviser’s investment teams, which are organized by industry, invest across the capital structure with the goal of achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns and protecting capital. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s investment objectives of seeking a high level of current income with a secondary objective of capital appreciation will be achieved or that the Fund’s investment program will be successful.
An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. The Fund’s investment policy of investing primarily in bank loans and high yield securities, including special situations opportunities, involves certain risks. Investors could lose some or all of their investment.
The securities in which the Fund will invest may be rated below investment grade. Such securities are regarded as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to an issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal and are commonly referred to as “high yield” securities or “junk” bonds.
For a summary of the risks associated with an investment in the Fund, please see the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus. The Fund intends to use leverage. Leverage involves the use of various financial instruments or borrowings in an attempt to increase the return of an investment. The use of leverage involves risk, including the potential for higher volatility and greater declines of the Fund’s net asset value, and fluctuations of dividends and other distributions paid by the Fund. For additional risk information, see the “Leverage” section of the prospectus.
Risks: For information regarding the risks associated with an investment in the Fund, including, No operating history, Investment and market risk, Market discount risk, Leverage risk, Fixed-Income Instruments risk, Senior Loans risk, Credit risk, Subordianted and Unsecured or Partially Secured Loans risk, Mezzanie securities risk, Below Investment Grade Instruments risk, Special Situations risk, Short selling risk, Prepayment risk, Credit Derivatives risk, Derivatives risk, Income risk, Regulatory risk, Risks related to the Fund’s clearing broker and central clearing counterparty, Structured Products risk, Repurchase Agreements risk, Reverse Repurchase Agreements and Dollar Rolls risk, Swap risk, Options and Futures risk, Exchange-Traded Funds risk, Counterparty risk, Counterparty and Prime Brokerage risk, Lender Liability risk, Distressed Debt, Litigation, Bankruptcy and Other Proceedings, Convertible Securities risk, When-Issued Securities and Forward Commitments, Risk of Investments in Equity Securities or Warrants Incidental to Investments in Loans and Fixed-Income Instruments, U.S. Government Debt Securities risk, Non-U.S. Securities risk, Foreign Currency risk, Eurozone risk, Legal and Regulatory risk, Event Driven Investing, Valuation risk, Liquidity risk, Inflation/Deflation risk, Conflicts of Interest risk, Tax risk, Uncertain Tax Treatment, Complex Transactions/ Contingent Liabilities/Guarantees and Indemnities, Dependence on Key Personnel risk, Material Risks of Significant Methods of Analysis, Non-Diversification Risk, Market Developments, Market Disruptions from Natural Disasters or Geopolitical risks, Government Intervention in the Financial Markets, Portfolio Turnover risk, Anti-Takeover Provisions, Risks Relating to Fund’s RIC Status, RIC-Related Risks of Investments Generating Non-Cash Taxable Income, please see “Investment objective, policies and risks” in the Fund’s prospectus.
