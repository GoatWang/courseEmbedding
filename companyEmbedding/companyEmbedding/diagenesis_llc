Reservoir quality prediction
 Geocosm  specializes in sandstone diagenetic modeling and reservoir quality risk assessment.
Our approach is scientifically rigorous, quantitative, reproducible, and testable. Our methods build on our expertise in sandstone diagenesis, petrophysics, basin modeling, computer simulation methods, and risk assessment.


Consortia
We work closely with industry 
				and academia to develop and apply new technologies designed to reduce 
				exploration and production related risk associated with sandstone 
				reservoir characteristics. 

RQC: Consortium for the Quantitative Prediction of Sandstone Reservoir Quality
T>Map consortium
Fracture Research and Application Consortium





 Technology 
 
T>Map™ extends Touchstone™ by automating the simulation of sandstone reservoir properties using data from 3D basin models.  T>Map can use burial history data exported from any 3D basin modeling system.  
Touchstone
  Our Touchstone™ software system incorporates facilities for analysis of controls on sandstone reservoir quality    in analog samples and for forward modeling of sandstone diagenesis and petrophysical properties for areas away from well control.  

Prism2D












Prism2D™ is our  unparalleled system for simulation of sandstone diagenesis and is an important  research tool for many Geocosm R&D activities. 
COAN
  COAN™ is an  image analysis system for sandstones that was developed by Geocosm for quantitative analysis of the spatial geometry of grain coating materials, among other things.

Carbonate Diagenesis







































 
                                245



Instructors: Dr. Peter A. Scholle, and Dr. Dana Ulmer-Scholle, New Mexico Tech & Scholle Petrographic
Synopsis 
Carbonate diagenesis includes any physical or chemical changes that occur in carbonate rocks after their deposition. It can begin on the sea floor and may include early subaerial exposure (syn/eogenetic) continue through possible burial (mesogenetic) and into possible uplift-related (telogenetic) realms. Since diagenesis has profound effects on the porosity and permeability evolution of the carbonate reservoirs, understanding these changes can provide valuable information on both the history of reservoir potential through time as well as the history of fluid flow through the units. Although many reservoirs produce mainly from original or early formed pores, there is a growing understanding that late-stage diagenesis can also form excellent productive porosity. Unlike most courses that consist of only lectures, this course provides participants an opportunity to have hands-on experience using standard petrographic techniques to better understand how diagenesis impacts carbonate reservoirs and how to identify the processes involved and their relative timing. This class is designed for participants who have some fundamental knowledge of geology and some minimal petrographic experience (i.e., can identify common minerals like quartz, calcite, etc. under the microscope)
The Course
Integrating petrography into petrophysical or core studies of carbonate rocks provides unique and important information about their diagenetic history. The information garnered from petrographic analyses can be utilized to better understand reservoir trends, diagenetic effects that impact reservoir quality, and fluid flow through these rocks. This course combines half-day lectures with hands-on petrographic observations of thin sections from a variety of carbonate rocks. Participants are also welcome to bring their own thin section samples to the class.
Course Topics
Overview of carbonate rocks and their composition
Syndepositional to early burial diagenesis (marine and meteoric processes)
Burial diagenesis
Uplift-related diagenesis
Dolomitization
The Instructors
Dana S. Ulmer-Scholle
Dana developed an early love for geology while growing up on the classic Upper Ordovician outcrops around Cincinnati, Ohio. She received a B.S. degree in 1981 from the University of Cincinnati. Dana completed a M.S. degree (1983) at Southern Methodist University working on the Mississippian Arroyo Peñasco Group of New Mexico. After a stint working for ARCO Exploration Co., she returned to SMU for a Ph.D. (1992). Her dissertation research concen- trated on evaporite-related diagenesis in upper Paleozoic carbonate rocks from New Mexico, Wyoming and Greenland.
Dana has worked, or consulted, for a number of companies including Amoco Oil and Gas Co., ARCO Exploration, ARCO International, Mobil Research, and Maersk Oil and Gas. Currently, she is the co-owner of Scholle Petrographic, LLC, a petrographic consulting company. Dana is also an Associate Research Professor at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. She teaches carbonate-related courses including petrography and depositional/diagenetic models. Her research interests include CO2 sequestration in carbonate and siliciclastic systems, carbonate sedimentology and diagenesis, petrography, low-temperature isotope and trace element geochemistry, fluid inclusion analysis and fluid flow histories in sedimentary rocks. While at New Mexico Tech, she has also been involved in environmental investigations that include heavy-metals bioremediation and fate-and-trans- port of heavy minerals in the environment. She is the author, coauthor or editor on numerous papers, reports, books and CD-ROMs with AAPG Memoir 77 receiving the Robert H. Dott, Sr., Memorial Award (2005). 
Peter A. Scholle
Peter received his B.S. in geology from Yale University in 1965. After a year at the University of Munich in Germany, and another year at the University of Texas at Austin, he received a Ph.D. in geology from Princeton University in 1970. His dissertation work, on deep-water carbonate turbidites in the Italian Apennines, was supervised by Al Fischer.
Peter’s professional employment included state and federal government, the petroleum industry, and academia. He worked for five years for various oil com- panies (Cities Service, Gulf and Chevron) and consulted for other oil companies for many years. Nine years were spent with the U. S. Geological Survey in Reston (VA) and Denver (CO), including three years as chief of the Oil and Gas Branch. He taught at the University of Texas at Dallas for three years and was Albritton Professor of Geology at Southern Methodist University in Dallas from 1985 to 1999. From 1999-2011, he was the New Mexico State Geologist and director of the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. He is now the co-owner of Scholle Petrographic, LLC. 
Peter has devoted much of his time to carbonate research and writing. His major interests are in deepwater carbon- ates (especially chalks) as well as the diagenesis and petroleum potential of Permian rocks in many areas of the world. He has worked in nearly 30 countries and has written, coauthored, or edited nine books, about 200 papers and abstracts, 23 CD-ROMs, and a number of other computer or audio-visual products. Peter has been a member of AAPG and SEPM since 1976-77. He was an AAPG Distinguished Lecturer (1975-76) and received the AAPG President’s award twice, the Sproule Memorial Award, the AAPG Certificate of Merit and the AGI Ian Campbell Medal for Superlative Service to the Geosciences (2013). He served as president and special publications editor of SEPM and is an honorary member of that society. He was also president of AGI and AASG (the Association of American State Geologists).

Title: Diagenesis, fracturing, and production from Monterey Formation, offshore California













            Diagenesis of the Monterey Formation includes the opal-A opal-CT microcrystalline-quartz transformation, dolomitization, and in some places the formation of brittle, vitreous cherts. These diagenetic transformations produce a more brittle rock. Diagenesis is thus considered a major control on the fracture potential of Monterey rocks. Once formed, fractures become excellent fluid migration paths. Fluid migration along fractures creates vuggy porosity adjacent to the fracture and may promote the generation of secondary matrix porosity, primarily in carbonate-rich lithologies. The Monterey is characterized by high matrix porosity but very low matrix permeability. The vast quantities of hydrocarbons produced from this formation require production from matrix porosity in addition to production from fracture porosity. A model is suggested in which matrix-bound hydrocarbons migrate into fractures that intersect high porosity-low permeability beds. These fractures either intersect high porosity-low permeability beds. These fractures either intersect other fractures, the borehole, or stratigraphic breccias; any or all of these conditions should enhance productivity. This model diminishes the problems associated with fluids migrating long distances through a low-permeability matrix. Implications of the model include the following: (1) fracturing carbonate-rich rocks with matrix porosity should yield the best production; (2) chert-rich lithologies with no matrix porosity will produce primarily frommore » fractures; (3) high-porosity shales with few fractures are candidates for hydrofracture treatments to enhance productivity.« less

Title: Diagenesis and secondary porosity enhancement from dissolution of analcime cement in reservoir sandstones: The Upper Permian Pingdiquan Formation, Junggar basin, northwest China













            The Junggar Basin is one of the largest and most important oil-producing basins in China, in which Upper Permian lacustrine oil shales are among the thickest and richest petroleum source rocks in the world. The Upper Permian Pingdiquan Formation was deposited predominantly in fan-delta sequences within a lacustrine setting. The Pingdiquan Formation sandstones constitute the principal oil reservoirs, whereas the interbedded black shales are the predominant oil source rocks. The early diagenetic mineral assemblage in the sandstones comprises siderite, pyrite, analcime, albite, calcite and authigenic quartz as well as trace amount of halite; By contrast, the late diagenetic minerals are characterized by authigenic K-feldspar, ankerite, and minor amounts of mixed-layer clay minerals. Petrographic, mineralogical and available paleoecological data suggest that early authigenic minerals in the sandstones were controlled by alternating periodic fresh water and saline/alkaline water episodes in a lacustrine environment. The cementation of siderite, analcime, calcite and albite occluded the substantial porosity in the sandstones at an early diagenetic stage. However, extensive dissolution of analcime cement and labile detrital feldspars occurred during burial diagenesis, resulting in a significant secondary porosity enhancement in the sandstones and making them very good quality oil reservoirs. The origin of secondary porosity is relatedmore » to the generation of various organic acids due to organic maturation of the interbedded exceptionally organic-rich oil shales.« less

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
