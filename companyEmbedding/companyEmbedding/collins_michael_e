Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results

DALLAS, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Michael E. Collins has been appointed to the Comerica Incorporated Board of Directors. Collins is a former banking and finance executive with nearly 40 years of regulatory experience, including service with the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and Philadelphia. In his final two years at the Philadelphia Fed he was the executive vice president in charge of all supervision and regulation. Collins will serve as a member of the board's Enterprise Risk Committee. The announcement was made by Ralph W. Babb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.










 







							 		Michael E. Collins was appointed to the Comerica Incorporated Board of Directors.
							  



 

 
 



"Mike is a welcome addition to the Comerica team," said Babb. "He brings to our board a number of key skills, including a strong background in risk management and relevant business management experience, as well as a deep understanding of the financial services industry, particularly bank regulation.  A former banker, consultant and strategic advisor, Mike has demonstrated considerable leadership abilities over the course of his long and distinguished professional career, and will bring thoughtful and valuable insights to our board."
Collins, 65, most recently served as a consultant to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and as Chairman of the Advisory Board of the American Bankers Association Stonier Graduate School of Banking. In addition, he was the President and Chief Executive Officer of TD Bank USA, part of the U.S. Retail business line of the Toronto, Ontario, Canada-based TD Bank Group, and managed the bank's Audit, Legal, Compliance, Anti-Money Laundering, and regulatory and government affairs functions. Collins also served in various roles with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia over a period of 37 years, including as supervising examiner, examination review officer and as a senior vice president and lending officer.
Collins has a bachelor's degree in economics and marketing from Susquehanna University. He also is a graduate of the University of Virginia's Graduate School of Retail Bank Management, and completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School, among other notable educational achievements.
"With Mike's appointment, we are bringing another fresh perspective to our board, as well as the right mix of skills and expertise as we continue to focus on delivering long-term value to our shareholders," added Babb. 
Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:    CMA) is a financial services company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and strategically aligned by three business segments: The Business Bank, The Retail Bank, and Wealth Management. Comerica focuses on relationships, and helping people and businesses be successful. In addition to Texas, Comerica Bank locations can be found in Arizona, California, Florida and Michigan, with select businesses operating in several other states, as well as in Canada and Mexico. Comerica reported total assets of $74 billion at September 30, 2016.

Collins Michael E
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Collins Michael E carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Collins Michael E currently holds license C28070 (Architect), which was Inactive when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Collins Michael E



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Collins Michael E



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.











What else should I know before hiring Collins Michael E



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
