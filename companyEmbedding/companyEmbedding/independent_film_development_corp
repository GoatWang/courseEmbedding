  Independent Film Development Corp http://www.indyfilmcorp.com/    O/S: 585,867,360 (October 14, 2016)    AS raised from 2B to 6B on 10-6-16 Real Estate Development WHAT WE DO With offices in New York City and Beverly Hills, IFLM is a diversified, publicly held real estate and entertainment company, whose common stock trades under the ticker symbol, IFLM. Management has developed a business plan of operations to acquire and develop undervalued and/or distressed commercial/residential real estate, and themed resort and hotel properties. The company’s plan of operations seeks to acquire real estate assets which present high value creation potential due to the complexity or illiquidity of their existing ownership and/or capital structure. In such situations, IFLM will seek to actively work through the complexities, gain control of the asset, actively manage, recapitalize and thereby create value. For those assets lying within the hospitality space, IFLM will leverage its entertainment, hospitality and film expertise to transform the properties into genre themed hotels and resorts. The final product will be a paradigm-shifting convergence of hospitality and entertainment, providing guests with a full immersion experience during their stay. For those assets lying outside of the hospitality space, IFLM will sell the assets at a price which realizes that added value creation for its investors.   Chief Executive Officer Jeff Ritchie was born and raised in Kansas. At the age of 21, he joined the Topeka Police Department and for the next seven and half years, he worked on everything from undercover narcotics and criminal intelligence to a federal drug enforcement task force. Moving to LA, Ritchie went into film production, and produced his first film within a year of arriving.  He then went on to produce, direct and write more than thirteen feature films and dozens of national commercial spots. During this time he developed and ran five separate production companies. Because of his creative talents, Mr. Ritchie was sought out by IFLM, offering Ritchie the position of CEO. He took the company still in its incubation stage to a fully reporting public company. Just this year, Mr. Ritchie stepped down as CEO of IFLM to make way for David Garland, as the company’s strategic focus shifted to real estate. The company focuses on developing genre themed hotel resorts and theme parks. This was Mr. Ritchie's brainchild which he developed from his 20+ years in the film industry, as well as his real estate investment and development work in LA’s San Fernando Valley. The ultimate goal is to match the best of creative Hollywood talent with hospitality and entertainment, creating the next generation of hotels, resorts and parks. Mr. Ritchie is focusing on this with the Port Royale and Hilltop Manor theme resorts.    CFO Rachel Boulds joined IFLM in February of 2012 and handles all things financial for the Company. From August 2009 to the present, Ms. Boulds has been engaged in her sole accounting practice, providing all aspects of consulting and accounting services to clients, including the preparation of full disclosure financial statements for public companies to comply with GAAP and SEC requirements. From August 2004 through July 2009, she was employed as an Audit Senior for HJ & Associates, LLC, where she performed audits and reviews for public and private companies including the preparation of financial statements to comply with GAAP and SEC requirements. From 2003 through 2004, Ms. Boulds was employed as an Audit Senior for Mohler, Nixon and Williams. From September 2001 through July 2003, Ms. Boulds worked as an ABAS Associate for PriceWaterhouseCoopers. From April 2000 through February 2001, she was employed as an eCommerce Accountant for the Walt Disney Group’s GO.com.  Ms. Boulds holds a B.S. in Accounting from San Jose University, 2001 and is licensed as a CPA in the state of Utah.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?

Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
