Sage Hospitality




















































Sage Hospitality, one of the leading hotel investment and management companies in the U.S., announced the purchase of seven Courtyard by Marriott hotels in partnership with Whitman Peterson.  The purchase marks the onset of a programmatic, highly-focused investment strategy between Sage and Whitman Peterson, wherein they plan to acquire a sizable portfolio of select-service hotels in need of high-impact capital, operational, and/or brand improvements.  
This first portfolio of hotels, purchased from Clarion Partners and C-III Capital Partners, will bring Sage’s management portfolio up to more than 60 hotels nationwide.  The properties are located in desirable, business-oriented submarkets of Atlanta, Ga., Dallas, Texas, Detroit, Mich. and Cleveland, Ohio.   Each hotel will receive significant capital for complete guestroom and public space renovations, which include the addition of the Marriott Courtyard Refreshing Business Lobby (including the “Bistro” dining concept) to assist in repositioning each property.  Once completed, these hotels will be better equipped to regain their leading positions within each submarket and take full advantage of their prime locations and strong brand.
“This transaction represents precisely the type of opportunity on which Sage and Whitman Peterson are uniquely qualified to execute,” said Michael Everett, Chief Investment Officer at Sage Hospitality.  “Our national investment, operating, and capital projects teams allow us to source, reposition, and efficiently operate one-off assets or large portfolios across the country – and having a significant allocation of capital toward this effort really opens up great opportunities for us.”  
The seven properties joining Sage Hospitality are:
• Courtyard Atlanta Norcross/Peachtree Corners
• Courtyard Marietta Windy Hill
• Courtyard Atlanta Marietta/I75 North
• Courtyard Dallas Addison/Midway
• Courtyard Dallas LBJ at Josey
• Courtyard Detroit Southfield
• Courtyard Cleveland Beachwood

Sage Hospitality's comprehensive management portfolio includes major international brands for Marriott, Starwood, Hilton and IHG as well as the independent boutique hotels. Sage Hospitality has further differentiated with the creation of the Sage Restaurant Group, which has created and is managing over nine unique restaurant concepts including the acclaimed Mercat a la Planxa restaurant in Chicago.

Our Search StrategyENTREPRENEURS THROUGH ACQUISITION
In all our investments, we seek to partner with exceptional entrepreneurs. In search, we back exceptional people who are seeking to be entrepreneurs through acquisition.
HOW DOES SEARCH WORK?
Search entrepreneurs ("Searchers") spend up to 3 years looking for a company to acquire and then operate as CEO.  Approximately 60% search solo and 40% search with a partner.  Searchers raise a small amount (usually $300k-$400k per Searcher) from investors who ideally provide the support and equity capital needed to find and acquire a target company.  Typically, ideal acquisitions for our Searchers are companies with strong recurring revenue, $2 to $5 million of cash flow, and a history of profit and growth. 
WHO ARE TYPICAL SEARCHERS AND INVESTORS?
While originally popular among newly-minted MBAs, the search model has captured the interest of many mid-level managers and even seasoned executives.  Over 200 search funds have been formed since 1983 and the model has gained significant popularity in recent years.  Search investors include both seasoned operators and investment professionals who immediately enhance the Searcher’s network, due diligence capabilities, and experience base.
WHAT IS OUR HISTORY IN SEARCH?
Our Founding Partner and Chairman, Joel Peterson, was one of the early investors in search funds and a former board member of Asurion.  Joel teaches courses in entrepreneurship and leadership at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and his firm, Peterson Partners, continues to be an active search fund investor. 
WHY WORK WITH US?
Searchers need three resources from investors: network, capital, and assistance.
1. A Large Network. Our network includes over 130 portfolio company CEOs and more than 100 investors with deep expertise in a variety of private equity, venture capital, and real estate markets. We regularly leverage this network to assist our Searchers. 
2. Flexible Capital. Our dedicated search group provides the initial capital required for the search unit and pro-rata or super pro-rata investments. Additionally, we have the flexibility to back Searchers with larger transactions. 
3. Assistance. Searchers often have a lonely road – whether looking for a business, or running one. Our mentality is that we work for our entrepreneurs, and we want to provide them whatever help they need. We believe our selective approach to investing in search fund entrepreneurs ensures our ability to deliver on our promise to be great partners. For us, success means building relationships that extend well beyond the first investment.  












“Peterson Partners has been fantastic to work with. They really understand our business and industry, and their insights have been essential in helping us evaluate our long-term strategy. It’s been a pleasure to have team players on our board whose expertise adds real value to our company.”
Mahesh Rajasekharan & Sumit Garg – Cleo

“Peterson has been far more than an investor since the inception of our search.  Peterson has acted as true partners and advisors as we narrowed in on an acquisition and have continued that support on our board as we run and grow this business.  Given our business has had both opportunities and challenges, both of which require difficult decisions, we are far better off having had and continue to have Peterson Partners on our team.”

Our Venture StrategyWe provide seed funding to exceptional entrepreneurs looking for a partner to help solve the challenges that accompany rapid growth.
Seed funding fills the gap between angels and traditional venture capital. Our initial investment size ranges from $100k to $500k, and we reserve significant capital to grow with our entrepreneurs and their companies over time.
Originally Peterson Ventures consisted of our Founding Partner and Chairman personally backing outstanding entrepreneurs. Over time, he recruited investment professionals that understood the unique pressures a start-up entrepreneur faces, and could help navigate those challenges.
Peterson Ventures now has a 6 year track record and has invested in more than 45 portfolio companies. We back 10-14 new entrepreneurs every year across many sectors, and we spend most of our time working for our entrepreneurs, however they need us.

WHO WE AREWe aim to be the partner of choice for outstanding entrepreneurs
Peterson Partners is an independent investment management firm with assets under management across a variety of alternative asset classes.
The core of who we are is in our name: ‘Partners’. We seek to be a true value-add partner to the entrepreneurs we back, and we look for entrepreneurs who desire more than just capital from an investment partner.
For over 15 years, Peterson Partners has been partnering with exceptional entrepreneurs. We have invested in over 200 companies, primarily in the US, but also Canada, Europe, Mexico, Brazil, and India. 
We were founded by Joel Peterson, a teacher of entrepreneurs, a long-time backer of entrepreneurs, and an entrepreneur himself. After helping to build Trammell Crow Company into a multi-billion dollar enterprise, eventually as Managing Partner, Joel left to teach at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and founded Peterson Partners, with the mission of helping entrepreneurs achieve their dreams. Since then Peterson Partners has grown into a professional, independent investment management firm with funds allocated across several disciplines: Private Equity, Seed Stage Venture, Search Funds, and Real Estate. 
Each business has a differentiated strategy, but the foundation of each remains the same as those first investments – we seek to be a true partner to outstanding entrepreneurs.

Our Private Equity StrategyPeterson Private Equity (PPE) is a middle market equity investor that is growth oriented, flexible, and has a long-term mindset. Over the past 11 years, Peterson has raised 7  private equity funds and has made investments across the United States, Canada, and Brazil.  Our initial investments range from $2 million to $20 million.
We believe that individuals are the key differentiator in success, and we seek to back entrepreneurs who are strong leaders and creative thinkers. We seek to become a true partner to our entrepreneurs and support them however we can to achieve their dream and their vision.
PPE invests across a broad range of asset classes and geographies. We take a flexible approach to each investment and are able to tailor a transaction that makes sense for each situation and entrepreneur. 
PPE makes flexible growth oriented investments in a variety of ways
1. Growth Investments (Majority & Minority)
PPE is best known as a flexible growth investor. We look for opportunities where our invested capital will remain within the business to accelerate an inflection point opportunity.
Whether the goal is to strengthen a balance sheet, expand into new markets, acquire a competitor or any number of growth related opportunities, PPE aims to provide not just capital, but also support and advice to assist the entrepreneur in responding to growth opportunities.
As a testament to our partnership approach, many of our investments are minority deals. We look to support the pursuit of our entrepreneurs’ vision, through access to our capital, expertise, and network – whether or not we have majority control.
2. Buy-outs
While Peterson is best known as a growth investor, we also participate in the more traditional buy-out investment opportunities. Our partner group has extensive experience executing buy-out transactions and has deep relationships in the middle market lending community. Still, in any of our leveraged buy-out investments, we are first looking to drive value through operational growth, and any leverage we use is conservative and context-driven.
3. Sponsor Co-Investments
Peterson frequently co-invests with other private equity firms and independent sponsors who are seeking our geographical or industry expertise. We have enjoyed productive, collaborative relationships with many co-investors over the years. Ultimately, our goal is to help our portfolio companies succeed – sometimes a mix of expertise is exactly what is needed.













"Peterson Partners understood the vision of what I wanted to accomplish in revolutionizing the airline industry. They were with me each step of the way in building that business."
David Neeleman – Founder, Azul
