Ashfield's Investment Principles
Dedicated to delivering excellent results by focusing on the future.
Each investment strategy at Ashfield Capital Partners reflects our core beliefs about building wealth through equity investing.
The future is worth more than the past.
One cannot invest in where a company has been, only where it is going. No doubt this is why studies show that, when buying, people are less concerned with a stock’s price (relative to any measure of value) than with its potential for appreciation. Growth in earnings per share is the strongest indicator of that potential and therefore the greatest driver of stock prices.
The future IS growth.
Economies and markets expand over time, driven by powerful demographic, social and technological forces that foster changes in consumer habits, increase productivity and generate new opportunities for companies and industries. As they evolve from groundswells to mainstream movements and, finally, create a new status quo, these trends affect economic sectors, industries and companies of all sizes.
The best companies leverage growth trends.
Companies that are involved in the genesis of trends (small- and mid-caps) or successfully build on them (large-caps) often grow earnings faster than their competitors or the market as a whole.
The more intellectual capital applied to the selection process, the better.
A computer can systematically, repeatedly and objectively compare the financial and valuation characteristics of hundreds or thousands of stocks. An experienced investment professional can assess intangibles, such as the mood of the market, or the strength of management and a corporation’s vision, strategy, and ability to execute. A team of experienced professionals, armed with the right computer technology, can do both, creating a more comprehensive understanding of a company's relative merits while providing a valuable "reality check" against the biases in any one person's judgment.
In keeping with these beliefs, we strive to build wealth through an identifiable and repeatable investment process that focuses on the central role of earnings growth and uncovers opportunities through a combination of systematic and fundamental assessment.












A Universal Investment Approach
Ashfield utilizes a bottom-up, fundamentally-driven, growth-oriented investment approach that integrates a systematic screen and rank process in order to bolster idea generation, as well as dynamically assess the relative attractiveness of our current holdings within the investable universe. This security selection process is grounded in portfolio construction that emphasizes risk management through careful monitoring and management of systematic exposures and their contribution to portfolio risk. Our process focuses on what we believe are quality growth companies with a competitive advantage, secular growth runways with visibility, which may or may not have stock specific catalysts to accelerate earnings or unlock growth potential.















Large Cap Growth Equity

Strategy Description
Our Large Cap Growth Equity strategy invests in 45-60 mid-large capitalization growth companies listed on domestic exchanges. Unique to this traditional growth strategy is the thematic overlay, which focuses on secular drivers over the next 3-5 years that serve as a tailwind to the quality growth companies identified in our bottom-up fundamental process. Risk management for this strategy emphasizes diversification by systematic factors and sectors exposures are typically modest relative to the Russell 1000® Growth Index. As such, the strategy exhibits modest active risk characteristics and seeks to add value predominantly through security selection.
Vehicles
Our Large Cap Growth Equity strategy is available as a separately managed accounts, as well as through financial intermediaries on SMA/UMA/MDA wrap platforms. We consider our Large Cap Growth Equity strategy to be inherently tax-sensitive, due to the portfolio’s relatively low turnover. We expect that portfolio turnover will average 25-45% per year over a full market cycle (approximately 3-5 years).
In addition to this, Ashfield offers a tax-efficient version of our Large Cap Growth Equity portfolio that offers a transition service for sufficiently large portfolios to transition a low basis portfolio over time, as well as monitoring for tax loss harvesting opportunities.

Balanced Large Cap Growth Equity

Strategy Description
As an extension of our firm’s Large Cap Growth Equity strategy, our Balanced Large Cap Growth Equity strategy invests in 45-60 mid-large capitalization growth companies listed on domestic exchanges and high quality bonds (or bond ETFs), with the objective of long-term capital appreciation plus income. This strategy employs Ashfield’s universal investment approach and shares the unique characteristics and components of our firm’s Large Cap Growth Equity strategy.

Strategy Description
Our Dividend Growth Large Cap Equity strategy invests in 30-50 mid-large capitalization growth companies listed on domestic exchanges. Similar to our firm’s traditional Large Cap Growth Equity strategy, this strategy focuses on quality growth companies with secular drivers over the subsequent 3-5 years. Additionally, this strategy invests in companies that have consistently paid and grown their dividend, resulting in an objective of capital appreciation with rising income. This differs from a pure “dividend yield” strategy that focuses on high yielding equities, as the foundation of earnings growth ensures the ability to continuously raise the dividend, protecting the yield in a rising interest rate environment.
