About Spectrum Pharmaceuticals

Spectrum Pharmaceuticals is a commercial-stage biotechnology Company with fully integrated commercial and drug development operations, and a leader in hematology/oncology. 


Our primary strategy is comprised of acquiring, developing and commercializing a broad and diverse pipeline of late-stage clinical and commercial products. In addition to an efficient in-house clinical development organization with regulatory and data management capabilities, Spectrum has established a commercial infrastructure for its marketed products. Currently, we have six oncology/hematology products on the market that target different types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,  advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, a type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and multiple myeloma. 








Careers at Spectrum
Visit our careers page to learn about new job opportunities and how to become a part of the Spectrum team.
  



Spectrum also has two drugs in late-stage development:

RolontisTM (eflapegrastim), being developed for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with breast cancer.

Qapzola (apaziquone) for Intravesical Instillation, being developed for immediate intravesical instillation post-transurethral resection of bladder tumors in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

Our passion to identify, develop and deliver important options for patients suffering from cancer is behind every action we take. At Spectrum, we are committed to excellence and strive to make a difference in the lives of patients every day.
The Key is our People
 Collectively, the members of our team have  relevant experience in both the development and marketing of oncology drugs and the growth of profitable business ventures. 
Our Goal is to Bring Quality Drugs to Patients
 Spectrum Pharmaceuticals actively seeks and evaluates potentially important drug candidates.  Once we identify these candidates, we rapidly assess preclinical and clinical data, and the commercialization potential of candidates. Then through both in-licensing and co-development partnerships, we provide the expertise and neccesary funding to bring the most promising products through the complex development process to market.
 In order to maximize the commercial potential of our current and future drugs, Spectrum has assembled a distinguished Commercial Team that was recruited from the top sales performers in the oncology specialty arena, and who are dedicated to bringing important, quality treatments to cancer patients.  


Spectrum's Code of Conduct 
 At Spectrum:

We will use all lawful and ethical means
    possible to bring our therapy options to the
    right patients, in the right way.
 We will be personally responsible to understand
    and adhere to the letter and spirit of all laws and
    Company policies that pertain to our daily
    business.  
We will partner only with healthcare
    professionals, suppliers, and other business
    partners who share our commitment to
    understand and uphold the laws and
    regulations that apply to our operations.  
We will respect and protect the dignity and
    privacy of patients, healthcare professionals and
    their staff, business partners, competitors, and
    our fellow employees.  
We will promptly and cooperatively report
    without fear of retaliation any behavior contrary
    to these principles to management, the
    compliance officer, or the compliance and
    whistleblower hotline.
