      PRESS RELEASE OF FSB BANCORP, INC.
    

      July 25, 2017
    

      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
    

      Contact: Dana C. Gavenda, Chief Executive Officer FSB Bancorp, Inc.
    

      Tel (585) 223-9080
    

      FSB BANCORP, INC.
    

      ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR TO DATE RESULTS
    

      Fairport, New York, July 25, 2017: FSB Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ: FSBC), the holding company for Fairport Savings Bank (the "Bank"), reported net income of $240,000, or $0.13 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to net income of $110,000, or $0.06 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Company's net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 decreased two basis points to 2.80% from 2.82% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in net interest margin was due to an increase in the average cost of our interest-bearing liabilities of nine basis points to 0.96% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 from 0.87% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 due to promotional deposit specials offered. The increase in interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on our interest-earning assets of seven basis points to 3.76% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 from 3.69% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
    

      For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company reported net income of $251,000, or $0.13 per share, compared to net income of $187,000, or $0.10 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Company's net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased three basis points to 2.85% from 2.82% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest margin was due to an increase in the average yield on our interest-earning assets of seven basis points from 3.70% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 3.77% for the six months ended June 30, 2017, partially offset by an increase in the average cost of our interest-bearing liabilities of four basis points from 0.88% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 0.92% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
    

      The increase in net income of $130,000 for the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016 resulted from increases in other income of $233,000 and net interest income of $167,000, partially offset by increases in other expense of $205,000, provision for income taxes of $50,000, and provision for loan losses of $15,000. The increase in other income was primarily attributable to increases in realized gains on sales of loans, mortgage fee income, and fee income. Benefiting from additional volume of mortgage loans sold in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of
    

      2016 resulted in an increase in realized gain on sales of loans. The increase in fee income was attributable to higher revenue from an increase in the volume of sales of non-deposit investment products through Fairport Wealth Management, the investment subsidiary of Fairport Savings Bank, during the second quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily reflective of the Company shifting its interest-earning asset mix to a higher level of higher yielding residential and commercial loans, while reducing lower yielding investment securities causing greater net interest income. This increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in the average cost of our interest-bearing deposits as well as increases in the average balances of our interest-bearing deposits and borrowings in order to fund the additional loan growth when comparing the second quarters of 2017 and 2016. The increase in other expense was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, miscellaneous other expense, data processing costs, and advertising, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage fees and taxes. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to annual merit increases for existing staff and the increased salary and commission costs associated with additional processing and mortgage origination staff as a result of mortgage loan growth. Miscellaneous other expense increased due to additional costs related to legal expense and professional services associated with becoming an SEC reporting company in the second half of 2016. Data processing costs increased primarily due to the additional expense associated with the conversion of our core processing system from in-house hosting to data center hosting in the third quarter of 2016. The increase in advertising comparing the second quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2016 was due to a promotional deposit gathering campaign strategically focused on branch deposit growth in 2017. The decrease in mortgage fees and taxes was primarily due to a recent change in New York State tax law which allowed for a refundable tax credit for mortgage recording tax expensed. The Company's provision for income taxes increased due to higher income before income taxes comparing the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016. The increase in provision for loan losses was attributable to adding an appropriate amount for loan losses to ensure adequate reserves based on, among other factors, additional growth in the loan portfolio and economic conditions in our market area when comparing the second quarter of 2017 with the second quarter of 2016.
    

      At June 30, 2017, the Company had $291.1 million in consolidated assets, an increase of
    

      $17.4 million, or 6.4%, from $273.7 million at December 31, 2016. Net loans receivable increased $15.9 million, or 7.0%, to $242.1 million at June 30, 2017 from $226.2 million at December 31, 2016. The Bank continues to focus on loan production as we continue to primarily grow our residential mortgage, construction, and commercial loan portfolios at a measured pace while still maintaining our exceptional credit quality and strict underwriting standards. Residential mortgage loans increased $8.1 million, or 4.3%, to
    

      $196.7 million at June 30, 2017 from $188.6 million at December 31, 2016. Construction loans increased $3.7 million, or 59.9%, to $9.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $6.1 million at December 31, 2016. Commercial real estate loans increased $2.2 million, or 25.7%, to $10.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $8.4 million at December 31, 2016. Multi-family residential loans increased $1.1 million, or 21.8%, to $6.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $5.1 million at December 31, 2016. Commercial and industrial loans increased $571,000, or 29.3%, to $2.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $1.9 million at December 31, 2016. The Bank originated $49.0 million of residential mortgage loans for
    

      the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $45.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Bank sold $31.5 million of mortgage loans in the secondary market during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $28.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as a balance sheet management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. The Bank sold these loans at a gain of $1.0 million which was recorded in other income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $860,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2017, the Bank was servicing $128.1 million in residential mortgage loans sold to Freddie Mac ("FHLMC") and will realize servicing income on these loans as long as they remain outstanding. At June 30, 2017, the Bank had $2.4 million in loans held for sale, comprised of one- to four-family residential fixed rate conventional, FHA, and VA mortgage loans originated and closed by the Bank in the second quarter of 2017 that have been committed for sale in the secondary market, and will be delivered and sold in the third quarter of 2017. Investment securities decreased by
    

      $174,000, or 0.7%, to $25.0 million at June 30, 2017 from $25.2 million at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents, primarily interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB, increased by $822,000, or 11.1%, to $8.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $7.4 million at December 31, 2016. FHLB borrowings decreased $1.7 million, or 2.9%, to $55.1 million at June 30, 2017 from $56.8 million at December 31, 2016. Total deposits, primarily money market and certificates of deposit increased by $18.9 million, or 10.3%, to $201.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $182.9 million at December 31, 2016 to fund our loan growth. Total stockholders' equity increased $296,000, or 0.9%, to $32.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $31.9 million at December 31, 2016. At June 30, 2017, the Bank was considered well capitalized, the highest standard and capital rating as defined by the Bank's regulator.
    

      The credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio remains strong and significantly better than peers. At June 30, 2017, the Bank had one non-performing residential mortgage loan totaling $37,000 and at December 31, 2016, the Bank had no non-performing loans. We recorded a $112,000 provision for loan losses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and a $90,000 provision for loan losses for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to adding general reserves to support the growth in our residential mortgage, construction, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loan portfolios. The allowance for loan losses was $1.1 million, or 0.46% of loans outstanding, at June 30, 2017 compared to $990,000, or 0.44% of loans outstanding, at December 31, 2016. Management remains committed to maintaining a high level of asset quality as we grow our residential mortgage, construction, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loan portfolios.

FSB Bancorp, Inc Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Second Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2017
Jul 25 17
FSB Bancorp, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported interest and dividend income was $2,596,000 against $2,312,000 a year ago. Net interest income was $1,933,000 against $1,766,000 a year ago. Income before income taxes was $332,000 against $152,000 a year ago. Net income was $240,000 against $110,000 a year ago. Net income per common share was $0.13 against $0.06 a year ago. Return on average assets of 0.33% against 0.17% a year ago. Return on average equity of 2.98% against 2.82% a year ago. The increase in net income partially was offset by increases in other expense of $205,000 and provision for income taxes of $50,000, and provision for loan losses of $15,000.

For the six months, the company reported interest and dividend income was $5,082,000 against $4,579,000 a year ago. Net interest income was $3,828,000 against $3,487,000 a year ago. Income before income taxes was $315,000 against $221,000 a year ago. Net income was $251,000 against $187,000 a year ago. Net income per common share was $0.13 against $0.1 a year ago.

FSB Bancorp, Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
Apr 28 17
FSB Bancorp, Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported interest and dividend income of $2,486,000 against $2,267,000 a year ago. Net interest income was $1,895,000 against $1,721,000 a year ago. Loss before income taxes was $17,000 against income before income taxes of $69,000 a year ago. Net income was $11,000 or $0.01 per common share against $77,000 or $0.04 per common share a year ago. Return on average assets was 0.02% compared to 0.12% a year ago. Return on average equity was 2.89 % compared to 2.82% a year ago. Book value per share was $16.72 compared to $16.76 a year ago. The decrease in net income of $66,000 for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 resulted from an increase in other expense of $218,000, a $7,000 increase in provision for loan losses, and a decrease in other income of $35,000, partially offset by increases in net interest income of $174,000, and benefit for income taxes of $20,000. The increase in net interest income was primarily reflective of the Company shifting its interest-earning asset mix to a higher level of both residential and commercial loans, while reducing investment securities causing higher net interest income, in addition to managing interest-bearing liabilities which resulted in interest expense remaining unchanged comparing the first quarters of 2017 and 2016.
