History[edit]




The Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco


In October 1904, A.P. Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco, which later became known as Bank of America.[3][4] In 1928, Giannini put the banks into a holding company he named the Transamerica Corporation. In 1930, the company acquired Occidental Life Insurance Company, which had been founded in 1906, and renamed it Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company.[5] Gradually, the company became a more diversified conglomerate which included the film studio United Artists,[6] Transamerica Airlines, and Budget Rent A Car.[7]
In 1972, construction of the Transamerica Pyramid skyscraper in San Francisco was completed, which served as the company's headquarters for many years. Although the company currently retains only a small presence in the building, the building is still depicted in the company's logo and marketing materials.[8]
In the 1980s, Transamerica began to divest and focused exclusively on financial services.[9] It was eventually pared down to three main product divisions: insurance, investments, and retirement. In July 1999, with Frank C. Herringer as CEO, Transamerica Corporation was acquired by Aegon, an insurance company based in the Netherlands.[10] Transamerica Occidental was merged into Transamerica Life Insurance Company October 1, 2008.
Products and services[edit]
Transamerica primarily offers insurance and financial services. Types of life and health insurance policies offered include term life,[11] whole life, universal life, variable universal life,[12] accidental death, Medicare supplement,[13] and long term care.[14] Transamerica companies also offer a variety of mutual funds and annuities.[15][16]
Transamerica’s retirement division offers defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans,[17] including 401(k) and 403(b),[18] 457, profit sharing, money purchase, cash balance, Taft-Hartley, multiple employer plans, nonqualified deferred compensation, and rollover individual retirement accounts. Other services include plan-level record keeping and administrative services, participant communications and education services, fiduciary risk mitigation services, open investment architecture, and compliance guidance and regulatory support.[19]
Sponsorships[edit]
Transamerica sponsors four professional golfers, two of whom are members of the PGA Tour, as well as one member each of the Champions Tour and LPGA Tour. These golfers are Zach Johnson, Tom Watson, Azahara Muñoz, and Kyle Stanley. Transamerica is also the jersey sponsor for the Colorado Rapids soccer team,[20] as well as the field sponsor for the Charlotte 49ers.[21] The Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award is also sponsored by Transamerica,[22] and is awarded to the best senior or fourth-year junior quarterback in college football in the United States. Winners include AJ McCarron, Collin Klein, and Andrew Luck.[23]
Transamerica sponsors numerous marathons and triathlons, including the Ironman,[24] Rock 'n' Roll Marathon,[25] and the Chicago Triathlon.[26] The company also sponsors USA Triathlon, the governing body for triathlon events in the United States.[27]
Foundations[edit]
Transamerica funds two foundations: the Aegon Transamerica Foundation and the Transamerica Institute. The Aegon Transamerica Foundation was created in 1994 and provides financial grants to community non-profit organizations. Transamerica employees also provide volunteering services to the organizations.[28] The foundation received the Corporate Citizenship Award in 2013 for creating the first urban farm in the state of Iowa.[29]
The Transamerica Institute consists of two divisionsthe Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies and the Transamerica Center for Health Studies. The Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies researches and provides education on trends, issues, and opportunities related to saving and planning for retirement.[30] The Transamerica Center for Health Studies focuses on identifying, researching, and analyzing health care issues facing consumers and employers.[31] The Transamerica Institute is funded by contributions from Transamerica Life Insurance Company.[32]

History[edit]




The Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco


In October 1904, A.P. Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco, which later became known as Bank of America.[3][4] In 1928, Giannini put the banks into a holding company he named the Transamerica Corporation. In 1930, the company acquired Occidental Life Insurance Company, which had been founded in 1906, and renamed it Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company.[5] Gradually, the company became a more diversified conglomerate which included the film studio United Artists,[6] Transamerica Airlines, and Budget Rent A Car.[7]
In 1972, construction of the Transamerica Pyramid skyscraper in San Francisco was completed, which served as the company's headquarters for many years. Although the company currently retains only a small presence in the building, the building is still depicted in the company's logo and marketing materials.[8]
In the 1980s, Transamerica began to divest and focused exclusively on financial services.[9] It was eventually pared down to three main product divisions: insurance, investments, and retirement. In July 1999, with Frank C. Herringer as CEO, Transamerica Corporation was acquired by Aegon, an insurance company based in the Netherlands.[10] Transamerica Occidental was merged into Transamerica Life Insurance Company October 1, 2008.
Products and services[edit]
Transamerica primarily offers insurance and financial services. Types of life and health insurance policies offered include term life,[11] whole life, universal life, variable universal life,[12] accidental death, Medicare supplement,[13] and long term care.[14] Transamerica companies also offer a variety of mutual funds and annuities.[15][16]
Transamerica’s retirement division offers defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans,[17] including 401(k) and 403(b),[18] 457, profit sharing, money purchase, cash balance, Taft-Hartley, multiple employer plans, nonqualified deferred compensation, and rollover individual retirement accounts. Other services include plan-level record keeping and administrative services, participant communications and education services, fiduciary risk mitigation services, open investment architecture, and compliance guidance and regulatory support.[19]
Sponsorships[edit]
Transamerica sponsors four professional golfers, two of whom are members of the PGA Tour, as well as one member each of the Champions Tour and LPGA Tour. These golfers are Zach Johnson, Tom Watson, Azahara Muñoz, and Kyle Stanley. Transamerica is also the jersey sponsor for the Colorado Rapids soccer team,[20] as well as the field sponsor for the Charlotte 49ers.[21] The Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award is also sponsored by Transamerica,[22] and is awarded to the best senior or fourth-year junior quarterback in college football in the United States. Winners include AJ McCarron, Collin Klein, and Andrew Luck.[23]
Transamerica sponsors numerous marathons and triathlons, including the Ironman,[24] Rock 'n' Roll Marathon,[25] and the Chicago Triathlon.[26] The company also sponsors USA Triathlon, the governing body for triathlon events in the United States.[27]
Foundations[edit]
Transamerica funds two foundations: the Aegon Transamerica Foundation and the Transamerica Institute. The Aegon Transamerica Foundation was created in 1994 and provides financial grants to community non-profit organizations. Transamerica employees also provide volunteering services to the organizations.[28] The foundation received the Corporate Citizenship Award in 2013 for creating the first urban farm in the state of Iowa.[29]
The Transamerica Institute consists of two divisionsthe Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies and the Transamerica Center for Health Studies. The Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies researches and provides education on trends, issues, and opportunities related to saving and planning for retirement.[30] The Transamerica Center for Health Studies focuses on identifying, researching, and analyzing health care issues facing consumers and employers.[31] The Transamerica Institute is funded by contributions from Transamerica Life Insurance Company.[32]

Fund of Funds







Fund of funds or multi-manager investing is an investment strategy that may invest in a portfolio of various mutual funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) or Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), instead of investing directly in shares of individual stocks, bonds or other securities.

With a broad range of investment styles, our subaccount lineup offers unique options that allow you to take advantage of investment strategies built into our subaccounts, or you may custom build your own strategy.
Please read an investment options prospectus carefully before choosing investment choices for your TPL variable universal life insurance policy. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. Both the return and principal value of subaccounts will fluctuate so that when redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost.
The investment options described in this section are offered within the variable universal life insurance contracts and are not offered for retail purchase.

A financial advisor can help his or her client select the investments and services that meet the client's specific needs and goals. Here are some highlights of the programs we provide:  Mutual Fund or Group Annuity Platforms  Third Party Administrator or Full-Service Options  Wide array of investment options A large array of well-known investment management companies Stable Value investment choices2  Target Date investment choicesTo make saving for retirement more simple, participants have the freedom to choose a Target Maturity portfolio that automatically balances among stocks, bonds, and cash, to help their asset allocation strategies stay on course. The participant may choose a portfolio built on or near their year of retirement, and the asset allocation of that portfolio adjusts accordingly as the target retirement date approaches. The "target retirement date" is the date on which participants intend to retire and start receiving distributions from the plan. While asset allocation is key to a portfolio's long-term returns, it should be understood that the principle value of Target Maturity portfolios is not guaranteed at any time, including at the target maturity date.3Target date investment choices are subject to the same risks as the underlying asset classes in which they invest. The underlying fund's asset allocation becomes more conservative over time, meaning that the percentage of assets allocated to stocks will decrease while the percentage of assets allocated to bonds and fixed income assets will increase as you approach the target date. Generally, the higher the fund's allocation is to stocks, the greater the risk. The significance of the underlying fundâ€™s target date is that it is the date at or around which the fund assumes you plan to start withdrawing your money. The principal value of the underlying fund and investment choice is not guaranteed at any time, including at and after the target date. You may lose money by investing in this investment choice, including losses near and following retirement. There is no guarantee that the underlying fund will provide adequate retirement income.Multiple Employer Plan SolutionsTransamerica Retirement Solutions uses a sophisticated recordkeeping platform to offer retirement plans that are easy to implement and maintain. That's why we've created a platform specifically for multiple employer plans, so these organizations and their adopting employers can build an affordable retirement plan. Plan & Participant ServicesCompany-sponsored retirement plans can use and customize the services we provide to best meet their business needs and goals. Your financial advisor can help you select which services are appropriate for your needs.

Sponsors can select investments that have been evaluated through our proprietary due diligence process, the Transamerica Investment Monitor. By creating an investment menu that is diversified across specified investment categories and satisfying other applicable requirements, sponsors may be protected by the fiduciary warranty in the event there is a legal judgment resulting in damages attributable to a breach in the warranty.     Let Us Tell You More  We think you'll find our innovative retirement plan products will meet your company's retirement needs.

Registered funds are available by prospectus only. Any mutual fund offered under the plan is distributed by that particular fund's associated fund family and its affiliated broker-dealer or other broker-dealers with effective selling agreements such as Transamerica Investors Securities Corporation (TISC), 440 Mamaroneck Avenue, Harrison, NY 10528. For more information on any registered fund, please call Transamerica Retirement Solutions at 800-755-5801 for a free summary prospectus (if available) and/or prospectus. You should consider the objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of an investment carefully before investing. The summary prospectus and prospectus contain this and other information. Read them carefully before you invest.**The Fiduciary Warranty provides that the investment line-up made available by Transamerica provides sponsors with a broad range of investment alternatives to offer to participants, that such investment choices are selected in accordance with applicable prudence standards, and that investment options are suitable for long-term investing. The Fiduciary Warranty applies to the general due diligence conducted by Transamerica (as described in the previous sentence) and does not apply to the performance of the underlying investment choices, nor does this Indemnification extend to claims that any expense paid directly or indirectly by the plan are reasonable, and it is still possible to lose money despite this warranty.

Chatham Partners, LLC is an independent, third-party research firm. Chatham Partners' 2015 Client Satisfaction Analysis is based on 581 large/mid-, and 543 small-plan client responses. The “Best in Class” references are to service categories when 85% or more of Transamerica clients rated Transamerica as a “6” or “7” on a 7-point scale. Transamerica Retirement Solutions is prohibited by law from providing tax or legal advice. The information contained on the site is intended solely to provide general summary information and is not intended to serve as legal or tax advice applicable to certain matters or situations. For legal or tax advice concerning your situation, please consult your attorney or professional tax advisor. Although care has been taken in preparing this material and presenting it accurately, Transamerica Retirement Solutions disclaims any express or implied warranty as to the accuracy of any material contained herein and any liability with respect to it.  2 The Transamerica stable value investment choices are backed by the general account of Transamerica Life Insurance Company ("TLIC") or Transamerica Financial Life Insurance Company ("TFLIC"). While TLIC or TFLIC declare rates periodically and back the principal and interest of these investment choices, any guarantees are subject to the claims paying ability of the insurance company. This investment choice is not guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Although plan participants generally may withdraw assets from the stable value investment choice without restrictions, TLIC/TFLIC may impose a hold period at the contract level in the event of a full contract discontinuance or partial contract discontinuance. Certain unaffiliated stable value investment choices (which are not supported by an insurance company general account) also may be available. These stable value investment choices instead invest in stable value fund bank collective trusts. These stable value investment choices may be subject to book value adjustments for withdrawals under certain circumstances, and the fees associated with stable value investment choices generally reflect different crediting rate/charge structure combinations. All Transamerica companies identified are affiliated.  3 Target date investment choices are subject to the same risks as the underlying asset classes in which they invest. The underlying fund's asset allocation becomes more conservative over time, meaning that the percentage of assets allocated to stocks will decrease while the percentage of assets allocated to bonds and fixed income assets will increase as you approach the target date. Generally, the higher the fund's allocation is to stocks, the greater the risk. The significance of the underlying fund’s target date is that it is the date at or around which the fund assumes you plan to start withdrawing your money. The principal value of the underlying fund and investment choice is not guaranteed at any time, including at and after the target date. You may lose money by investing in this investment choice, including losses near and following retirement. There is no guarantee that the underlying fund will provide adequate retirement income.   4 Transamerica Retirement Solutions was awarded 47 “Best in Class” Cups in the under $5 million to $1 billion markets in PLANSPONSOR® magazine's 2015 Defined Contribution Survey for sponsor and participant services. The complete results of the Defined Contribution Survey were announced in the November 2015 issue of PLANSPONSOR® magazine. The survey polled 5,109 clients. “Best in Class” awards are given to the three highest scoring providers in each area of service and any other providers with scores that exceed the benchmark score established for a given asset range. 5Transamerica’s plan sponsor and plan participant websites have been awarded DALBAR’s Seal of Excellence for ten consecutive years.

Innovation









Today, we are working at P&G to build a better company. Our goal is clear—meeting the needs of consumers better than the best competitors to deliver winning total shareholder return. We are doing this by focusing on a stronger portfolio, setting new standards of excellence, bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do, and empowering our people to keep the consumer at the center of everything we do.
Building a better company demands a streamlined, focused approach to our portfolio, and ensuring our brands continue to delight consumers.
A Strengthened Portfolio

Global leader in 10 categories with 65 brands that leverage P&G’s core strengths
Daily-use categories where purchase intent and choice are driven primarily by a specific job to do and the product's effectiveness
A focused portfolio for faster growth and higher profitability

We are also establishing a higher standard of excellence for all our brands. Success requires bringing these standards to every brand, and we are investing to fuel our growth by making these standards a reality.
New Standards of Excellence

Irresistibly Superior Products
Irresistibly Superior Packaging
Superior Brand Communications
Excellent Retail Execution
Winning Customer and Consumer Value Equation

Investing for growth requires bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do.  This approach has allowed us to deliver on our initial productivity commitment and to raise the bar with plans to save even more.

Productivity

$10 billion saved from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016.
Up to an additional $10 billion in savings from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021.
The objective: balanced top-and-bottom line growth that consistently delivers total shareholder return in the top-third of our peer group.

Our efforts are underpinned by an organization that is experienced, agile, accountable and committed to win. To further strengthen our performance, we’re also designing our structures to enable greater speed and agility, and we’re moving resources closer to consumers and customers, driving deeper mastery and accountability.
Empowering Our Organization and Culture

Today, 70% of our commercial function employees reside in local markets—executing innovation, advertising, and merchandising programs by leveraging their unique local knowledge.
In large markets, such as the US and China, we’re moving to end-to-end accountability. This model gives category business leaders full profit and loss responsibilities.
In smaller markets, we’re implementing a “freedom within a framework,”  empowering leaders to make real-time changes in strategy without engaging regional or global resources.
We’re also hiring from the outside—with the number of external hires quadrupling across five different levels of management including senior leadership.

Winning results happen when we earn them—every day, every week, every month, every quarter and every year—in every brand and in every country in which we compete.  And today, we are building a better company that is delivering on just that.

FUND PERFORMANCE

*Expense ratios are as-of the most recent prospectus. Contractual arrangements have been made with the fund’s investment manager, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), through March 1, 2017.**Reflects average annual returns. Returns for funds that are less than one year old are not annualized.  The performance data presented here represents past performance; Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance may not be available for all periods indicated.  Net asset value (NAV) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains but do not reflect the deduction of any sales charges. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. There are no sales charges for Class R shares. Class R shares are available only to eligible retirement plans. Performance figures reflect any fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the Investment Manager. Without such waivers and/or reimbursements, the performance would be lower. Future waivers and/or reimbursements are at the discretion of the Investment Manager. 1 Year returns reflect total return.

Historical Beta illustrates a fund’s sensitivity to price movements in relation to a benchmark index. Alpha is a coefficient measuring the portion of a fund’s return arising from specific (non-market) risk. Tracking Error is the difference between the price behavior of a fund and the price behavior of a benchmark. R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund’s movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated by using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Information Ratio is a ratio of portfolio returns above those of a benchmark compared to the volatility of those returns. U.S. allocations may include U.S. territories and possessions.The Net Other Assets (Liabilities) category may include, but is not limited to, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending collateral, forward foreign currency contracts, and cash collateral.

Innovation









Today, we are working at P&G to build a better company. Our goal is clear—meeting the needs of consumers better than the best competitors to deliver winning total shareholder return. We are doing this by focusing on a stronger portfolio, setting new standards of excellence, bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do, and empowering our people to keep the consumer at the center of everything we do.
Building a better company demands a streamlined, focused approach to our portfolio, and ensuring our brands continue to delight consumers.
A Strengthened Portfolio

Global leader in 10 categories with 65 brands that leverage P&G’s core strengths
Daily-use categories where purchase intent and choice are driven primarily by a specific job to do and the product's effectiveness
A focused portfolio for faster growth and higher profitability

We are also establishing a higher standard of excellence for all our brands. Success requires bringing these standards to every brand, and we are investing to fuel our growth by making these standards a reality.
New Standards of Excellence

Irresistibly Superior Products
Irresistibly Superior Packaging
Superior Brand Communications
Excellent Retail Execution
Winning Customer and Consumer Value Equation

Investing for growth requires bringing a productivity mindset to everything we do.  This approach has allowed us to deliver on our initial productivity commitment and to raise the bar with plans to save even more.

Productivity

$10 billion saved from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016.
Up to an additional $10 billion in savings from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021.
The objective: balanced top-and-bottom line growth that consistently delivers total shareholder return in the top-third of our peer group.

Our efforts are underpinned by an organization that is experienced, agile, accountable and committed to win. To further strengthen our performance, we’re also designing our structures to enable greater speed and agility, and we’re moving resources closer to consumers and customers, driving deeper mastery and accountability.
Empowering Our Organization and Culture

Today, 70% of our commercial function employees reside in local markets—executing innovation, advertising, and merchandising programs by leveraging their unique local knowledge.
In large markets, such as the US and China, we’re moving to end-to-end accountability. This model gives category business leaders full profit and loss responsibilities.
In smaller markets, we’re implementing a “freedom within a framework,”  empowering leaders to make real-time changes in strategy without engaging regional or global resources.
We’re also hiring from the outside—with the number of external hires quadrupling across five different levels of management including senior leadership.

Winning results happen when we earn them—every day, every week, every month, every quarter and every year—in every brand and in every country in which we compete.  And today, we are building a better company that is delivering on just that.

Revenue Sharing






Introduction
Transamerica Financial Advisors, Inc. (“TFA”) does business through two separate Divisions. One division is headquartered in the company's home office located in St. Petersburg, FL, and operates under the name, Transamerica Financial Advisors, Inc. without any Division designation. The other Division, based in Johns Creek, GA, operates under the name Transamerica Financial Advisors Inc. Transamerica Financial Group Division, (“TFG”). Each Division may have different product and service offerings and different compensation arrangements with product and service sponsors and providers. The information discussed below is a compilation of compensation and revenue sharing arrangements for both Divisions and for TFA as a whole, and except as otherwise provided, reference to “TFA” is intended to refer to both Divisions, including TFG. A summary of the revenue sharing and sponsoring company compensation arrangements and current Sponsoring Company list for TFA and TFG can be found at the Home Page of TFA at www.tfa.transamerica.com, and the Home Page of TFG website at www.tfaconnect.com, under Revenue Sharing.
Compensation
(TFA) and its Registered Representatives (RR) and Investment Advisor Representatives (collectively “RRs”) are compensated in different ways when selling a mutual fund, or variable insurance product, (collectively referred to as “product”), depending on the amount invested and/or share class purchased. Most mutual funds charge an annual fee associated with operating the fund, and a sales commission or “load,” which is paid to TFA and may be charged to you up-front when you purchase the product, annually, or at the back-end when you sell the product. Most variable products assess fees and/or back- end charges which are used to compensate TFA and its RRs. Other load structures also exist, and you should review the fee table located in the product prospectus for a complete discussion of fees and expenses. You should also refer to your copy of the applicable TFA product disclosure that is provided to you at the time you purchase any product through TFA. These overall expenses impact the overall return on your investment.
Internal Compensation
We also want you to know that TFA has a few unique relationships with a select group of product sponsors (“Sponsoring Companies”) that have a variety of performance and investment styles with a broad spectrum of investment choices and services. TFA has chosen to work with these companies because of the array of investment choices and services these companies offer to address the varied needs of our client base and because of their reputations, size, marketing and operational sophistication and level of wholesaling support. TFA receives additional compensation or payments (also known as “revenue sharing”) as a result of these relationships. The greater access afforded these companies to work with our RRs provides additional training, educational presentations, and other product support so that each RR may work more effectively to better serve you. Of course, TFA’s RRs are not required to recommend any of these particular products to you; however, this greater level of access could influence a RR’s product recommendation to you. Certain sponsoring Companies may provide advance commissions to RRs based on the anticipated receipt of insurance premiums. TFA maintains an approved product list that contains a wide variety of mutual fund and variable insurance companies, in addition to the companies included on the Sponsoring Company list. A summary of the revenue sharing and Sponsoring Company compensation arrangements and current Sponsoring Company list for TFA and TFG can be found at the Home Page of TFA at www.tfa.transamerica.com, and the Home Page of TFG website, www.tfaconnect.com under Revenue Sharing.

TFA does not provide differential compensation (or higher net payouts) to RRs which are more favorable for investments made in Sponsoring Company products, with the exception of variable universal life insurance products issued by Transamerica Premier Life Insurance Company and Transamerica Life Insurance Company, and variable annuity products issued by Transamerica Life Insurance Company, (“Transamerica Life”), affiliated companies, and investments in proprietary investment advisory programs, which have a higher net compensation level. However, additional cash benefits and non-cash compensation or reimbursements may be provided as described below in the section on Revenue Sharing. Also, some mutual funds and variable insurance products carry a higher sales charge than others (resulting in higher gross compensation to TFA), which could influence a RR’s product recommendation to you. The fee table located in the product prospectus should be reviewed for a complete discussion of all fees and expenses.
In addition, TFA’s managers and/or RRs who meet certain productivity or assets under management (“AUM”) standards may be eligible for additional compensation. Sales of products sponsored by affiliated companies, including Transamerica Premier Life Insurance Company and Transamerica Life Insurance Company, and AUM levels achieved in TFA proprietary investment advisory programs may help RRs and/or their managers qualify for other benefits, and may provide such persons with special incentive to sell Transamerica Premier Life Insurance Company and Transamerica Life Insurance Company and/or affiliated company products, services, or programs. For example, TFA’s RRs and their managers may be eligible to participate in a voluntary stock purchase plan that permits participants to purchase stock of AEGON N.V. (Transamerica’s ultimate parent) by allocating a portion of the commissions they earn to purchase such shares. A portion of the contributions of commissions by TFA’s RRs may be matched by TFA.
Revenue Sharing
TFA RRs and/or their managers may receive directly or indirectly additional cash benefits and non-cash compensation or reimbursements from TFA or its affiliates, Sponsoring Companies, or other product issuers, including but not limited to reimbursements for sales and/or public seminar and advertising expenses. Additional compensation or reimbursement arrangements may include payments in connection with TFA’s conferences or seminars, sales or training programs for invited RRs and other employees, seminars for the public, trips (such as travel, lodging and meals in connection therewith), entertainment, merchandise and other similar items, and also payments, loans or loan guaranties to assist a RR in connection with systems, operating, marketing or other expenses. This cash and non-cash compensation may be significant and may provide our affiliates, Sponsoring Companies, or other product issuers with increased access to the RRs.
TFA receives revenue sharing fees based on RRs’ overall sales of or AUM relating to investment products issued or services of programs sponsored by Sponsoring Companies. TFA receives such revenue sharing fees in a range of .10% to 2.5% ($10 to $250 per $10,000) of the total value of assets placed by TFA’s RRs in products or services offered by Sponsoring Companies, and, for variable life insurance, in a range of 5% to 10% of target premium. TFA negotiates these payments annually with each Sponsoring Company to defray the ongoing costs of training, education, marketing and product support activities. These revenue sharing payments are in addition to the sales charges, annual service fees (commonly referred to as “12b-1 fees”), redemption fees and deferred sales charges, and other fees and expenses disclosed in a mutual fund’s or other product’s prospectus fee table and the TFA product disclosure checklist. Revenue sharing payments, however, are paid out of the Sponsoring Company’s assets. Moreover, no portion of these payments to TFA is made by means of brokerage commissions generated by the mutual fund or other product and no portion of these payments are directed or allocated to RRs. You should refer to the Prospectus and/or Statement of Additional Information (available on request from the product issuer) for a complete discussion on how revenue sharing programs with distributors such as TFA are administered.
TFA also receives due diligence and marketing fees when selling real estate investment trust interests (also known as REITS) and limited partnership interests, depending on the amount invested. These fees are paid from client monies and are fully disclosed in the product prospectus. You should review the product prospectus for a complete discussion of fees and expenses. Some of these product sponsors are also provided greater access to our RRs to provide training, educational presentations and other product support.
Wholesaling
TFA also receives revenue from Transamerica Funds, an affiliated mutual fund company, for wholesaling activities, support, education, and training.
TFA also receives revenue from Transamerica Life, Transamerica Premier Life, and certain non-affiliated variable insurance product sponsors for wholesaling activities. These product sponsors are provided access to TFA RRs who may receive additional compensation and incentives for these wholesaling activities.
