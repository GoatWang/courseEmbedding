                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms Two Classes from Nissan Auto Receivables 2014-A Owner Trust | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Two Classes from Nissan Auto Receivables 2014-A Owner Trust
    





November 13, 2015 01:32 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed two 
      classes of the Nissan Auto Receivables 2014-A Owner Trust as follows:
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and 
      loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within 
      Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and credit 
      enhancement, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios 
      consistent with the original ratings and make full payments to investors 
      in accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxies and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transactions. Lower loss coverage could affect the ratings and 
      Rating Outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transactions, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectations. To date, the transactions have exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations, with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pools 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of Nissan 
      Auto Receivables Owner Trust 2014-A can be found in 'Nissan Auto 
      Receivables 2014-A Owner Trust -- Appendix'. The R&W are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.
