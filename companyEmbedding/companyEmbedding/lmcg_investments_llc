						  Relative Value Credit





Investment PhilosophyThe Serenitas relative value credit strategy focuses on building a portfolio where returns are not predicated on market direction. We dynamically allocate capital across corporate and mortgage credit markets, using a low net risk approach to credit spreads and interest rates. We specialize in trading residential mortgage backed securities, CLOs, and credit derivatives. Given the market inefficiencies in these areas, our proprietary analytics provide a unique advantage in finding undervalued optionality. The five investment professionals with extensive proprietary trading experience have been working together for almost a decade.

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY LMCG’s Global Equity investment philosophy is based on a bottom-up quantitative approach to investing intended to exploit market inefficiencies by identifying stocks with attractive valuations that also have good growth prospects and high quality of earnings. By selecting stocks ranked highly on a variety of metrics which are based on fundamental investing principles, the team is able to diversify the sources of alpha in the portfolio to achieve more stable returns and weather different market environments.
Our portfolio construction process uses proprietary tools, not an optimizer to construct portfolios. This feature allows the team to build portfolios one stock at a time in order to select those stocks that offer the best exposure to the team’s alpha and risk factors. The team can also adapt to market conditions and lessen or accentuate certain factors in the model to capture opportunities or reduce downside risk. Our stock selection model is designed to be a model for all seasons and incorporates factors that are expected to work at different times and through different economic cycles.
Our factors are grouped into Market Dynamics, Value and Quality.

LMCG Investments LLC utilizes a classic value strategy that seeks to acquire solid companies whose stocks are temporarily out-of-favor. Focus is placed on stocks that are believed to offer a high probability of modest outperformance rather than a low probability of high outperformance. The Boston-based firm was founded in 2000.


"We take a classic value investment approach which focuses on solid companies whose stock is temporarily out-of -favor in the market. We believe that leading businesses which are selling at a discount to fair value because of a transitory issue have the potential to generate strong excess returns over time."

About LMCG




The LMCG Fund’s Adviser is LMCG Investments, a multi-strategy boutique investment firm, where experienced investment teams are supported by institutional caliber compliance, operations and marketing capabilities. Investors benefit from the investment acumen of our internal teams, all operating with a degree of autonomy that allows them to do their best work. In addition to oversight by the Adviser’s experienced Chief Investment Officer, the teams are supported by an overarching corporate structure that reaches across the firm to help each team manage their risk exposures, and benefit from rigorous compliance protocols and operational support. The leadership of LMCG has a long history of working together and have provided trading, settlement, and operational expertise for strategies invested in over 40 countries, for traditional long only, directional long-short and market neutral approaches, across an array of fixed income and equity based strategies.

This mix of entrepreneurialism and oversight enables us to provide investment expertise with the assurance that investors’ interests are paramount. Principals of the firm are significant investors in the LMCG Funds and the strategies upon which the funds are based.
Our firm is built on the belief that highly talented institutional management teams with distinct and unique investment skills provide valuable perspective during different market environments. Currently, we have teams focusing in the following asset classes: Emerging Markets, International Small Caps, International Large Caps, U.S. Small and Mid Caps (both Growth and Value respectively), and U.S Large Cap Core Growth. We feel this breadth and depth of exposure to the equity markets around the globe sets LMCG apart.

PHILOSOPHY FOR GLOBAL MULTICAP FUND


We
Believe



Global Multicap




That investing in global equities offers the best opportunity for superior long term returns, capitalizing on the widest and most comprehensive public equity opportunities.
That the normal marketing cycle and ideal investing cycle are often in conflict – and that we as an institution will strive to ensure our clients interests are foremost in the investment process.
That small entrepreneurial teams of talented investment professionals may deliver better long term performance than their peers.
That in-depth knowledge and understanding of internal investment managers’ thought processes will assist asset allocators in potentially producing superior risk adjusted returns.
That no single investment philosophy is superior to another in the long run and that time tested skill of experienced professionals adhering to their investment disciplines and putting the client’s interests first are essential to delivering superior results.




PHILOSOPHY FOR GLOBAL MARKET NEUTRAL FUND


We
Believe



Global Market Neutral




That traditional investing in equities and fixed income may be improved upon by the thoughtful and timely use of alternative investments.
That investments which have low historic correlation to traditional asset classes and that are managed to avoid the severe ups and downs of the market should be the first alternatives funds that investors add to their portfolios.
That markets often misprice stocks, and that understanding historical mispricing trends positions us to capitalize on future mispricing occurrences.
That the ability to create alpha will ebb and flow in different segments of equity markets and in different regions of the world at different times. Therefore, a global market neutral strategy stands a better chance of delivering stable returns than alternative approaches which focus on single sub-asset classes or markets.
That the use of leverage, other than for the function of short selling securities, creates unacceptable risk for most alternative investments.
That periodically, market conditions create irregular and sometimes large changes in returns of alternative strategies, and that it is essential for the investment manager to communicate clearly and promptly about the nature of those disruptions.




PHILOSOPHY FOR INTERNATIONAL SMALL CAP FUND


We
Believe



International Small Cap




That international small cap equity is an asset class underutilized by many investors – both institutional and individual
That an allocation to international small cap equity can offer diversification benefits for an equity investment program
There is more opportunity for active managers to add value versus a passive benchmark in international small cap equity than there is in international large cap equity
That exposure to non-dollar assets makes sound investment sense given the potential for a weakening US dollar
That a quantitative approach to investing in international small cap equities may be more efficient than other approaches, given the far-reaching geographical scope of this market





Leverage – Investing with borrowed money as a way to amplify investment gains, at the risk of greater losses.

Disclaimer:
There can be no guarantee that any strategy (risk management or otherwise) will be successful. All investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund. You may obtain a prospectus by calling (877) 591-4667. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.
