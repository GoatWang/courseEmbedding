CHICAGO, June 14, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Hill & Knowlton announced the appointment of Claire A. Koeneman as Executive Vice President and US practice leader for financial communications. Claire will report directly to Dan Bartlett, US president and CEO, and will be based in the firm's Chicago office.
As an established leader in the financial communications industry, Claire will lead H&K's expanding focus on C-suite and Board counsel and transaction communications, and will focus on helping public and private companies achieve their strategic, financial and business goals. She will also oversee client program growth and executive development across the agency's US financial communications practice. 
Most recently Claire was president of Financial Relations Board (FRB) where for seventeen years she partnered with senior management teams to help maximize their valuation and enhance their corporate reputation. She has substantial expertise in transaction-related financial communications, including 144a, IPO and secondary offerings, M&A, bankruptcies, restatements and crisis communications. 
Claire also has significant experience counseling clients on corporate communications, PR, media campaigns and other strategic issues. 
"The addition of Claire provides our clients the proven wisdom necessary to navigate an increasingly complex regulatory process and critical understanding of the role that corporate reputation plays in financial transactions," said Bartlett. "As we continue to expand our commitment to financial communications, I'm confident that Claire's award-winning experience providing C-suite counsel offers our clients a competitive advantage."
"The continuously evolving financial landscape has resulted in a more rigorous set of expectations for companies looking to communicate their strategy. The new leadership at Hill & Knowlton understands the intersection of finance, regulation and reputation and I'm thrilled to be a part of this growing team," said Koeneman. 
Claire has won numerous awards for her clients and has personally been awarded "IR Professional of the Year" from PR News, the Stevie "Best Executive in a Services Business" Award and PRWeek's "Investor Relations Professional of the Year." She holds a MBA in finance from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a BA from Smith College. 
A founding member of The United Way Women's Leadership Council and The White House Project in Chicago, Claire is also a member of numerous leadership organizations in the Chicago area including the Economic Club of Chicago and the Leader Council of Mercy Home for Boys and Girls. Additionally, she serves as a Diplomat to the Principality of Monaco in its Honorary Consular Corps.
