Accordingly we find that the more clear-sighted evolutionary philosophers are beginning to posit it there. Each atom of the nebula, they suppose, must have had an aboriginal atom of consciousness linked with it; … the mental atoms … have fused into those larger consciousnesses which we know in ourselves and suppose to exist in our fellow-animals.”- William James, “The Principles of Psychology,” 1890"A man is but the product of his thoughts, what he thinks, he becomes:" M.
