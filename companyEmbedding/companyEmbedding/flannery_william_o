				PRNewswire
			
WESTFORD, Mass., Jan. 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cynosure, Inc. , which designs, manufactures and markets medical devices for aesthetic procedures and precision surgical applications worldwide, today announced that the Company's independent directors have elected William O. Flannery as Lead Director. Flannery, a member of Cynosure's Board of Directors since June 2013, will continue to serve on the Compensation and the Nominating and Corporate Governance committees of the Board.  Flannery's duties as Lead Director will include chairing meetings of the Company's independent directors, participating in the setting of meeting agendas, consulting on matters of corporate governance and Board performance with the Chairman, and facilitating communications between other members of the Board and the Chairman. He also will be available, when appropriate, for consultation and communication with shareholders.  "The appointment of Bill Flannery as lead director is an important step in demonstrating our commitment to strong corporate governance," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Davin. "The lead director's role is to advance the independence of the board in representing the interests of the shareholders. With his extensive legal and corporate governance background, Bill is ideally suited for this responsibility."   Flannery, who served as the Company's Secretary and counsel from 2004 to 2013, has maintained his own legal practice focusing on the representation of technology-based companies. Since 1993, he also has served as of counsel to Goulston & Storrs P.C., a Boston law firm, where he was a partner from 1992 to 1993. Flannery has served as counsel to and a director of a number of companies. He was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company by then Governor William Weld and was subsequently elected Chairman by its members.  He was the general counsel of Thermo Electron Corporation from 1985 to 1992, and its vice president-administration from 1990 to 1992.
