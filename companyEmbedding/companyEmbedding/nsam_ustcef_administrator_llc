NEW YORK and LOS ANGELES, Oct. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE:   NSAM), Colony Capital, Inc. (NYSE:    CLNY) and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE:   NRF), today announced the adoption of a best-in-class corporate governance structure for the pro forma combined company, Colony NorthStar, Inc. ("Colony NorthStar", or the "Company"), and an agreement to amend the terms of the definitive merger agreement announced on June 3, 2016, pursuant to which the three companies will combine to form Colony NorthStar in an all-stock transaction.








Colony NorthStar Best-in-Class Corporate Governance Structure
The amendment to the merger agreement provides for a best-in-class governance structure for Colony NorthStar.

New Independent Directors with Extensive Real Estate and Board Governance Experience.   Colony NorthStar's board will include two new independent directors, Jon A. Fosheim and Douglas Crocker II, who are each highly respected and recognized leaders in the real estate industry. 
Board Size to be Reduced.  Colony NorthStar's board will be comprised of 10 directors (a reduction from previously contemplated board size of 13 directors), with five members jointly selected by NSAM and NRF, including Messrs. Fosheim and Crocker, and five members selected by Colony. At the closing of the transaction, eight of the ten directors of the Colony NorthStar board will be independent under NYSE rules, including Colony's four current independent directors. 
No Classified Board.  All of Colony NorthStar's directors will stand for election annually.  
Will Opt out of MUTA.  Colony NorthStar will opt out of all of the provisions of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the Maryland General Corporation Law, otherwise referred to as the Maryland Unsolicited Takeover Act, that would have permitted Colony NorthStar's board to elect, without stockholder approval, to adopt a classified board structure and other anti-takeover provisions. 
Majority Voting Standard for Election of Directors.  In uncontested elections, members of Colony NorthStar's board will be elected by majority vote, with incumbent directors who are not re-elected being required to submit a resignation. A plurality vote standard will apply to contested elections. 
Stockholders Will be Permitted to Call Special Meetings.  Stockholders holding 25% of the Colony NorthStar voting power will be entitled to call a special meeting of stockholders.  This is reduced from the majority requirement previously contemplated. 
Stockholders to Have the Right to Remove and Replace Directors.  Colony NorthStar stockholders will have the right to remove directors at a special meeting of stockholders, with or without cause, by majority vote. Colony NorthStar stockholders will also have the right to fill vacancies resulting from the removal of directors. 
Stockholders May Amend Bylaws. Stockholders will be entitled to amend bylaws by majority vote.   In addition, Colony NorthStar's board will not be permitted to unilaterally amend any bylaw provisions adopted by stockholders. The prior charter provision permitted under Maryland law that precluded stockholders from amending Colony NorthStar's bylaws will be eliminated. 
Stockholder Approval will be Required to Increase the Number of Shares Available for Issuance.  The charter provision permitted under Maryland law that allowed the board to increase or decrease without stockholder approval the number of Colony NorthStar's shares available for issuance will be eliminated.  Any such increase will require the approval of Colony NorthStar's stockholders by majority vote. 
Directors will be Subject to Stock Ownership Guidelines.  Directors will be required to maintain stock ownership equal to four times their annual cash retainer.

The management of NSAM, CLNY and NRF believe that having a shareholder-focused corporate governance structure will enhance Colony NorthStar's business and value to stockholders. 
Incremental Cash Dividend for NSAM Shareholders 
Per the amendment to the merger agreement, NSAM will pay its pre-closing stockholders a special cash dividend of $228 million (approximately $1.16 per share), an increase of $100 million above the $128 million special cash dividend NSAM was permitted to pay under the original merger agreement. This special dividend will be in addition to NSAM's regularly scheduled dividend of $0.10 per share payable in November. 
Stockholder-Oriented Executive Compensation Plan
Colony NorthStar intends to implement a plan for executive compensation substantially similar to Colony's existing compensation program.  The primary goal of the program would continue to be to align the interests of executive officers with those of stockholders in a way that allows the Company to attract and retain the best executive talent by rewarding favorable stockholder returns, the Company's competitive position within its segment of the real estate and investment management industries and each executive officer's long-term career contributions to the Company.   
Severance Compensation 
NSAM's Executive Chairman David Hamamoto, CEO and President Al Tylis, Chief Investment and Operating Officer Dan Gilbert, Chief Financial Officer Debra Hess, and Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary Ron Lieberman, have each agreed that the number of Colony NorthStar shares that they will be entitled to receive for their previously reduced, contractually owed severance payments, which was to be determined based solely on the volume weighted average trading price of the Colony NorthStar shares over the five trading days following the closing of the merger, will be determined based on the greater of (i) a $15.00 per share price and (ii) the five trading day volume weighted average price of Colony NorthStar following the closing of the merger. 
Mr. Hamamoto has also agreed to submit his resignation as a director of Colony NorthStar in the event that his equity interest in Colony NorthStar falls below 50% of his equity interest as of the closing of the transaction.
Merger Timing and Integration Update
The management of NSAM, CLNY and NRF plan to hold their respective shareholder meetings prior to the end of the year and close the merger in January 2017. Colony NorthStar's lending banks have reaffirmed their financing commitment for the transaction, and the company has made substantial progress on the merger integration planning and reiterates its strong capital position. At the close of the merger, the Company intends to commence payment of an annualized dividend of $1.08 per share, payable quarterly.
Voting Agreement
In connection with the amendments, MSD Capital L.P. and MSD Partners L.P. and certain of their respective affiliates, which together own approximately 10.2% of NSAM's outstanding shares, have entered into a voting agreement whereby they have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the transaction at the NSAM special meeting.
MSD Capital and MSD Partners stated, "NorthStar and Colony have made some very important improvements to the terms and proposed structure of the merged company.  The governance changes assure greater alignment with shareholders and we believe they will better position the new Colony NorthStar for future growth.  We are pleased to support the new proposals and look forward to the closing of the merger and to the company's future success." 
Richard B. Saltzman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Colony Capital, Inc., stated, "We are extremely pleased that the modifications described regarding improved corporate governance and the reduction in the potential maximum number of shares issued pursuant to contractually owed severance payments inure to the benefit of all future Colony NorthStar shareholders. Furthermore, we remain focused and are working hard on various integration and strategic planning matters in order to be well positioned for the anticipated closing of the transaction in January. Finally, we are delighted to have the support of MSD Capital and MSD Partners for this transformational merger." 
 The foregoing descriptions of the amendment to the merger agreement, the voting agreement and the agreements by the NSAM executives are only a summary and are qualified in their entirety by the amendment to the merger agreement, the voting agreement and the agreements with the executives that will be filed as exhibits to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by each of NSAM, CLNY and NRF, as the case may be.  The Company encourages all interested parties to read such agreements in their entirety, as they contain additional changes and provisions that are not discussed in this press release.

Nationstar to move call center operations back to U.S. to improve service, create jobs
Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc.  said Wednesday that it will move its customer service operations back to the U.S., which would create 500 new jobs. The move is an effort to improve the customer experience. "Our customers shared with us that speaking to U.S. based representatives would make their service experience better, so we prioritized that feedback and have invested in moving all of our call center operations back to the United States," said Chief Executive Jay Bray. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has lost 1.6% year to date through Tuesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.9%.
