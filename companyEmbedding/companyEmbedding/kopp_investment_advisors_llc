Kopp Daniel F. Garofalo Adam F. Engebretson John G. Keyes 34 Item 4 - Advisory Business Kopp Investment Advisors, LLC ( KIA ), founded in June 1990, is an independent firm whollyowned by LeRoy C. Kopp. KIA manages investment accounts for individual and institutional clients. We offer a range of equity portfolio management styles generally derived from our three primary strategies: Emerging Growth Strategy, AccruHealth Strategy and Total Quality Management (TQM) Strategy. Our Blend Strategies are comprised of accounts incorporating a blend of the primary strategies. Our Emerging Opportunities Strategy is a subset of our Emerging Growth Strategy. KIA typically provides investment supervisory services on a discretionary basis. Under these circumstances, KIA makes all investment decisions for client accounts and, when it deems appropriate and without prior consultation with the client, buys, sells, exchanges, converts and otherwise trades in stocks, bonds, other securities and other financial instruments, subject to any written guidelines and/or restrictions as the client may from time to time provide to KIA. In addition, such discretionary authority allows KIA to exercise whatever powers the client possesses with respect to any of the assets in the account, as KIA deems necessary and appropriate in the management of the account. From time to time, however, KIA may provide investment supervisory services on a non-discretionary basis. KIA accounts are primarily managed for long-term capital appreciation independent of clients other assets. For advice on asset allocation, retirement or tax planning, insurance needs, or other financial matters, clients must consult their broker, lawyer, accountant or other financial professional. While KIA, throughout the advisory relationship, strives to obtain an understanding of each client s situation, such information is not necessarily available to KIA. Thus, the client ultimately determines whether KIA management is appropriate given the client s other assets, obligations, and financial needs or changes therein. KIA may serve as a portfolio manager in wrap fee and similar programs sponsored by unaffiliated financial services firms, such as investment advisers and broker-dealers. Generally, under a wrap fee program, a client of the sponsoring financial institution will be able to obtain professional investment management and transaction execution for a single fee. Each wrap fee program sponsor sets its own fees for clients participating in the program and will pay KIA for its advisory services rendered to the client out of the fees it charges to its clients. The fee that KIA receives generally will be negotiated with the program sponsor and may be affected by the size of the accounts being managed and the nature of the investment objectives being utilized by KIA in connection with the program. These fees may vary from the schedules of fees set forth in Item 5, below, and from program to program. Fees charged to clients in wrap fee programs are set forth in the sponsor s disclosure document, which is delivered to clients by the wrap fee sponsor at the start of the client relationship. Wrap fee programs that KIA currently participates in are identified in KIA s Form ADV Part 1A, which is available on the SEC s website at  As of December 31, 2014, KIA managed $225,837,216 in assets on a discretionary basis. As of such date, KIA did not manage any assets on a non-discretionary basis. 45 Item 5 - Fees and Compensation KIA s management fee for its advisory services depends on the portfolio management style employed and, in any case, is based on the market value of the account assets (comprising securities, cash and money-market balances). Standard Fee Schedule The fee for our Emerging Growth Strategy, AccruHealth Strategy, Blend Strategies and the Emerging Opportunities Strategy is generally 1.50% annually, billed by KIA and payable quarterly in advance. The fee for our TQM Strategy is generally 1.00% annually, billed by KIA and payable quarterly in advance. Each of these investment management strategies (and various blends and subsets of these strategies) is discussed under Item 8, below. Fee Schedule for Institutional and High Net Worth Clients For accounts that are owned by certain institutions and high net worth individuals with specified minimum account balances, KIA offers the tiered fee schedules set forth below. A letter of intent may be used as a way for investors to meet the minimum investment requirements for these fee schedules. Emerging Growth Strategy, AccruHealth Strategy, Blend Strategies and the Emerging Opportunities Strategy (Minimum Account Balance of $5 million) Account Assets Annual Fee First $20 million 1.00% On amounts over $20 million Negotiable TQM Strategy (Minimum Account Balance of $1 million) Account Assets Annual Fee First $50 million 0.50% On amounts over $50 million Negotiable Additional Information Although KIA believes that its management fees are fair, all clients should be aware that lower fees may be available from other sources. From time to time, KIA may negotiate or waive the amount and payment of any management fee. KIA may also group multiple accounts of one client relationship together for purposes of calculating a negotiated fee. Clients may authorize KIA in the investment management agreement to deduct advisory fees directly from the client s custodial account. It is the client s responsibility to review the advisory fees included in the account statements provided by the custodian. KIA s management fees do not include transaction costs, custodial fees, or other investment expenses. For more information on these types of fees, see Item 12, Brokerage Practices, below. Moreover, clients whose assets are invested in shares of mutual funds and other pooled investment vehicles ( acquired funds ) will pay both a direct management fee to KIA, as well as 56 indirect management fees and other expenses incurred by the acquired funds. Please refer to the acquired fund s prospectus or other offering documents for more information. De minimis fluctuations in assets deposited for or withdrawn from management throughout a quarter may not be subject to fee proration on a daily or monthly basis. Unless otherwise provided, management agreements may be terminated and advisory fees changed upon written notice. KIA will refund to a client after any such termination a ratable share of a prepaid fee computed on a daily basis for a 90-day quarter. Item 6 - Performance-Based Fees and Side-By-Side Management KIA does not charge any performance-based fees, which are fees based on a share of capital gains or capital appreciation of client assets. Item 7 - Types of Clients KIA manages investment accounts for individuals, trusts, estates and institutional clients including pension and profit sharing plans, charitable organizations, and corporations or other business entities. KIA may also provide investment advice to common trust funds and collective investment funds maintained by banks or trust companies. In addition, KIA may serve private investment companies, such as private limited partnerships and private limited liability companies, and offshore investment funds. Generally, for separate accounts, KIA requires a minimum account size of $100,000 and reserves the right to change the account minimum at any time and without notice. KIA may make exceptions to this minimum based on client type, a pre-existing relationship with the client or other factors. Clients that participate in wrap fee and similar programs described in Item 4, above, may not be subject to KIA s minimum account thresholds. Item 8 - Methods of Analysis, Investment Strategies and Risk of Loss We offer a range of equity portfolio management styles generally derived from our three primary strategies: Emerging Growth Strategy, AccruHealth Strategy and TQM Strategy. Our Blend Strategies are comprised of accounts incorporating a blend of the primary strategies. Our Emerging Opportunities Strategy is a subset of our Emerging Growth Strategy. Each strategy and the material risks associated with each strategy are described below. Emerging Growth Strategy KIA s Emerging Growth Strategy is an aggressive equity strategy. The guidelines for initial construction of the portfolios in this strategy call for up to 100% of client assets in the account to be invested in emerging growth companies that are expected to experience accelerated earnings growth. After the initial step of gathering investment ideas, KIA narrows its focus by examining company fundamentals. Company attributes important to KIA include: 67 a leading industry position or technology/product that will establish leadership in the future; projected annual revenue or sales growth of 15% or greater and projected earnings growth of 20% or greater; significant investment in research and development (R&D) producing new products that will drive future growth; a strong financial position, including low debt to total capital; and management excellence. KIA believes management is key to the equation. KIA looks for chief executive officers who have the uncommon ability to balance a visionary scope and practical business sense. Specifically, KIA looks for a person with a track record of being successful and a commitment to quality. KIA believes that good leadership points the way to solid execution and consistent progress toward long-term success. Emerging growth companies are often in the same or related market sectors, subsectors, or industries. Because of market capitalization and ownership concentration, these stocks may trade more thinly and may have a more limited public float than established companies. In addition, the share prices of these stocks may be quite volatile. As a result, client portfolios may be vulnerable to a less efficient market and to increased stock illiquidity and volatility than that applicable to large-cap stocks. Assets allocated to this style should represent the aggressive equity portion of an overall portfolio. A client must be willing to accept high volatility and have no immediate need for liquidity. The vast majority of emerging growth company stocks are listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Believing that a few good ideas are better than many mediocre ones, KIA attempts to find investments that can be held for at least three to five years and to minimize portfolio turnover. KIA will hold positions much longer than is typical in the industry. KIA does not attempt to time the market. AccruHealth Strategy KIA s AccruHealth Strategy focuses on capital appreciation through investments in emerging growth companies in the health care sector. Special emphasis will be given to the following subsectors of health care: medical devices; diagnostics; health care information technology; life science tools and instruments; specialty pharmaceuticals; and biotechnology. Sub-sector weightings will be determined by the manager s views of areas of opportunity, and are subject to change without notice. The management of this strategy will utilize a core position management strategy. At any point in time the manager may identify a core position as fairly priced, undervalued or overvalued. The manager will weight the percentage held of a core position in the account based on the common stock s current price versus the manager s perception of the stock s value. From time to time, the manager may perceive value and invest 78 in other securities of a company, including warrants, convertible preferred stock or convertible debt, either in addition to or in lieu of direct investments in a company s common stock. This strategy is likely to result in higher turnover than the Emerging Growth Strategy. In addition, accounts in this strategy may utilize exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to gain broad exposure to a sector or sub-sector. Non-health care stocks will make up a minority percentage of the account at all times. Accounts may also hold cash in order to retain the flexibility to respond promptly to changes in market and economic conditions. TQM Strategy KIA s TQM Strategy is a less aggressive equity strategy and focuses on TQM companies. TQM, which refers to Total Quality Management, is a management philosophy where a company undertakes a systematic process of evaluating its business practices and engages in a continuous effort to improve its operations throughout the organization. The guidelines for initial construction of these portfolios call for up to 100% of client assets in the account to be invested in companies generally included in the S&P 500 Index that have implemented TQM, as determined by KIA. KIA evaluates company fundamentals to determine the depth and effectiveness of a company s commitment to TQM using a proprietary three-pronged scoring methodology. First, KIA scores companies using indicators to represent many of the criteria outlined in the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, including leadership, customer focus and business results. The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award is administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Second, KIA scores each company using a unique ranking of publicly available information indicating a company s success in implementing quality-based management techniques. Third, surveys of leading quality experts drive an additional set of scores that KIA evaluates. KIA compiles all of the information to generate a Composite Quality Score for each company. Individual accounts, referred to as TQM Core 40, hold stocks of approximately companies with high Composite Quality Scores relative to their peers. The companies are selected from a cross section of economic sectors represented in the S&P 500 Index. Blend Strategies KIA s Emerging Blend accounts are a blend of the primary strategies set forth above and are designed to have a slightly lower risk profile than accounts in the Emerging Growth Strategy. In addition to emerging growth company stocks, to lower risk, approximately 30% of the client assets in these accounts will be invested in common stocks of companies generally included in the S&P 500 Index that have implemented TQM, as determined by KIA. In addition to Emerging Blend accounts, KIA also offers Balanced Blend and TQM Blend accounts calling for approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, of client assets in these accounts to be invested in companies generally included the S&P 500 Index that have implemented TQM, as determined by KIA. Individual account and stock percentages are flexible, as all portfolios experience unique cash flows and are individually managed with a long-term outlook. Emerging Opportunities Strategy KIA s Emerging Opportunities strategy is a subset of the Emerging Growth Strategy and focuses on long-term capital appreciation through investment in emerging growth companies. However, securities holdings in an account managed pursuant to the Emerging Opportunities Strategy may 89 be more concentrated in a limited number of smaller capitalization companies. These companies may also be concentrated within specific industries or sectors and may be less liquid and subject to greater price volatility. Additionally, KIA occasionally has the opportunity on a very limited basis to acquire securities of emerging growth companies made available through initial public offerings (IPOs), private placements of public equity (PIPEs) or similar types of registered or unregistered transactions. In KIA s view, securities acquired through these transactions may be appropriate for accounts managed pursuant to its Emerging Opportunities Strategy because these transactions typically involve securities of smaller capitalization companies that are subject to heightened liquidity concerns and greater price volatility. Types of Investments KIA primarily offers investment advice on domestic and foreign equity securities, that is, common stock. Occasionally, ETFs may be utilized in client accounts to maintain targeted or broad market exposure. This occurs most frequently in connection with client-directed portfolio management actions such as tax-loss harvesting. On an infrequent basis, KIA may invest in warrants, preferred stock or corporate debt securities, generally of companies within the Emerging Growth Strategy, AccruHealth Strategy and the Emerging Opportunities Strategy. Typically, holdings of securities in client accounts other than common stock have resulted from offerings which include a warrant or other security in addition to common stock. This may occur in connection with a PIPE or secondary offering. At times, clients direct KIA to hold specific securities. These are treated by KIA as unsupervised assets. KIA expresses no opinion on these holdings. Cash balances are generally invested in money market funds available through the client s custodian. Occasionally, other short-term investment vehicles are used as an alternative to money market funds. These typically include investment company securities (mutual funds) or ETFs. Risk of Loss Risk of loss is inherent in any investment in securities. Past performance does not guarantee future results, and there is no guarantee that your investment objectives will be achieved. Your account may be subject to the following risks: Management Risk. KIA and its portfolio managers will be delegated the authority to buy and sell securities on your behalf. You must rely upon the managers abilities and judgment and upon their investment abilities. There is no guarantee that the portfolio managers investment techniques will be successful. Equity Securities Risk. Common stocks and other equity securities generally increase or decrease in value based on the earnings of a company and on general industry and market conditions. The value of a company s share price may decline as a result of poor decisions made by management, lower demand for the company s services or products or if the company s revenues fall short of expectations. There are also risks associated with the stock market overall. The stock market may experience periods of turbulence and instability. Small Capitalization Company Risk. Investing in securities of small capitalization companies generally involves a higher degree of risk than investing in securities of larger companies. The prices of securities of smaller companies are generally more volatile than those of larger 910 companies, they generally will have less market liquidity, and they may be more likely to be adversely affected by poor economic or market conditions. These risks generally increase as the size of the companies decrease. Large Capitalization Company Risk. Larger, more established companies may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges such as changes in consumer tastes or innovative smaller competitors. Also, large-cap companies are sometimes unable to attain the high growth rates of successful, smaller companies, especially during extended periods of economic expansion. Foreign Investing Risk. Investments in foreign companies and markets carry a number of economic, financial and political considerations that are not associated with the U.S. markets and that could unfavorably affect your account s performance. Among those risks are greater price volatility; weak supervision and regulation of securities exchanges, brokers and issuers; higher brokerage costs; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and related conversion costs; adverse tax consequences; and settlement delays. ETFs Risk. An investment in an ETF generally presents the same primary risks as an investment in a conventional mutual fund (i.e., one that is not exchange traded) that has the same investment objective, strategies and policies. The price of an ETF can fluctuate within a wide range, and an ETF will lose value if the prices of the underlying investments owned by the ETF go down. Like mutual funds, ETFs are subject to investment advisory, transactional, operating and other expenses. Beneficial Ownership under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ) In connection with its investments in emerging growth company stocks, in the aggregate, KIA often acquires on behalf of its clients beneficial ownership positions exceeding 5% of the outstanding securities of an issuer. Consequently, under federal securities laws, KIA is a frequent filer of statements on Schedule 13G and Schedule 13D, which should be consulted for additional information with respect to holdings in an individual company. These Schedules are available on the SEC s EDGAR database at  If KIA were to decide, or be required for any reason, to sell one or more of these positions over a short period of time or in a sustained down market, a client s account could suffer a greater loss than might be the case if KIA took no significant interest in any particular issuer. Companies with small market capitalizations and more concentrated ownership are inherently less liquid than large capitalization companies with more diverse ownership. From time to time, KIA and its affiliated persons may invest in the same companies selected for client portfolios and may report their holdings together with shares managed for clients in the same Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D. The filing of any such Schedule is not an admission that the persons filing are beneficial owners of the shares for purposes of Sections 13, 14, or 16 of the Exchange Act. KIA is a passive long-term institutional investor, who, together with its affiliated persons, expressly disclaims membership in any group under Sections 13 or 16 of the Exchange Act. KIA does not act as an agent of any client to enter into any agreement to act as a group with others for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or disposing of the securities of an issuer or to gain corporate control or to influence corporate affairs of an issuer. 1011 Item 9 - Disciplinary Information There have been no legal or disciplinary events involving KIA or any of our employees involving investments or investment-related activities or that are otherwise material to a client s evaluation of our advisory business or the integrity of our management. Item 10 - Other Financial Industry Activities and Affiliations KIA is an independent investment adviser wholly-owned by LeRoy C. Kopp. Mr. Kopp s interest is held indirectly through a revocable business trust for which he currently serves as the sole trustee. KIA is not affiliated with any other financial services firms. Item 11 - Code of Ethics, Participation or Interests in Client Transactions and Personal Trading KIA maintains a Code of Ethics (the Code ) which governs all employees and requires them to adhere to the highest standards of business conduct. It is KIA s policy for each client s interest to come before that of KIA and its employees. The Code addresses KIA s policies relating to compliance with laws and regulations, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, gifts and entertainment, personal trading and reporting and insider trading, and is intended to assist employees in carrying out their duties as fiduciaries to clients. Neither KIA nor persons associated with KIA may benefit personally or trade for their own accounts on the basis of material non-public information. KIA requires employees to pre-clear all personal securities transactions, subject to specific exceptions set forth in the Code. Although KIA believes the procedures set forth in the Code are appropriate to eliminate or mitigate potential conflicts of interest, clients should be aware that no set of procedures can anticipate or relieve all potential conflicts. A copy of the Code is available upon request to KIA. KIA and its affiliated persons may invest corporate, foundation, and retirement funds, as well as employee and related family account assets, in the same securities that are purchased for clients. As a result, clients should be aware that KIA may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of its advice. In addition, for reasons unrelated to the fundamental decision to buy, hold, or sell a stock, proprietary and related investment decisions may not be the same and may be opposite from client trades and may be effected at different times and/or prices. As a general rule, KIA employees may not engage in a personal securities transaction with respect to a particular security while any client account has a pending buy or sell order for the same security until the client order is either executed or withdrawn. Owing to market fluctuations, it is possible that proprietary and related accounts may receive a better price in a given security on a given day. Employee personal trading activities are monitored by KIA s chief compliance officer. From time to time, for their own accounts, KIA, its affiliated persons, and employees and their families may invest in unseasoned, turnaround, or early-stage issuers and/or securities considered inappropriate or too speculative for all or some client portfolios. Such investments may pose a conflict of interest with respect to KIA s fiduciary obligations. KIA, its affiliated persons, and employees and their families may also invest in the securities of, and make charitable contributions to, institutions and firms whose directors, officers, and controlling persons may 1112 also be clients of KIA. Such relationships may pose a conflict of interest between KIA s fiduciary obligation and its desire to attract and retain clients. Item 12 - Brokerage Practices In the absence of written client direction, KIA exercises discretion in the selection of brokerdealers ( brokers ) for the execution of trades. In placing brokerage, KIA s overriding objective is to obtain the best qualitative execution for the managed account. In essence, this means that KIA seeks to execute securities transactions for clients in such a manner that the client s total cost or proceeds in each transaction is the most favorable under the circumstances. When evaluating brokers, KIA considers such factors as: the value of the research provided; the commission rates charged; the ability to negotiate commissions; the ability to obtain volume discounts; execution capability; financial responsibility; responsiveness to KIA; the terms and conditions specified by the client or portfolio manager; size of the order; and depth and liquidity of the market for the security. While KIA seeks reasonably competitive commission rates, a client may not pay the lowest commission or spread available on any particular transaction. KIA has adopted procedures to ensure that its duty of best execution is being met. KIA has adopted a Brokerage Committee that is comprised of senior portfolio managers, trading personnel and KIA s chief compliance officer. The Brokerage Committee meets on a quarterly basis and is responsible for monitoring the firm s trading practices and periodically reviewing and evaluating the services provided by brokers and the quality of executions, research, commission rates, and overall brokerage relationships. Other than in circumstances where a client directs KIA to use a certain broker (see Directed Brokerage, below), when selecting or recommending brokers KIA does not consider whether the broker refers clients to KIA. Soft Dollar Arrangements As permitted by Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act, KIA engages in the long-standing investment management industry practice of paying higher commissions to brokers who provide brokerage and research services than to brokers who do not provide such services, if such higher commissions are deemed reasonable in relation to the value of brokerage and research services provided. These types of transactions are commonly referred to as soft dollar transactions. Two different types of research services are typically acquired through these transactions: (i) proprietary research services offered by the broker executing a trade and (ii) other research services offered by third parties through the executing broker. Research services that may be obtained by KIA through soft dollar transactions include, but are not limited to: 1213 economic, industry or company research reports or investment recommendations; subscriptions to financial publications or research data compilations; compilations of securities prices, earnings, dividends and similar data; and services of economic and other consultants concerning markets, industries, securities, economic factors and trends. These research services enable KIA to supplement its own research and analysis used in connection with providing advice to its clients as to the value of securities, the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities, and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities; the furnishing to clients of analyses and reports; and the effecting of securities transactions and performing functions incidental thereto (such as clearance and settlement) on behalf of clients. To the extent that KIA uses client transactions to obtain research or other products or services that KIA could otherwise purchase for cash, KIA receives a benefit because we do not have to produce or pay for such research, products or services. As a result, KIA may have an incentive to place more trades or pay higher commissions than would otherwise be the case due to our interest in receiving these benefits, rather than our client s interest in receiving most favorable execution. However, KIA monitors this potential conflict of interest through its Brokerage Committee, which reviews all trading practices, including soft dollar arrangements. Soft dollar transactions are not effected pursuant to any binding agreement or understanding with any broker regarding a specific dollar amount of commissions to be paid to that broker. However, KIA does in some instances request a particular broker to provide a specific research service, which may be proprietary to that firm or produced by a third party and made available by that firm. In such instances, the broker in agreeing to provide the research service frequently will indicate to KIA a specific or minimum amount of commissions which it expects to receive by reason of its provision of the particular research service. Although KIA does not agree to direct a specific or minimum commission amount to a firm in that circumstance, KIA does maintain an internal procedure to identify those brokers who provide it with research services and the value of such research services, and endeavors to direct sufficient commissions to ensure the continued receipt of research services KIA feels are useful in managing client accounts. Research or brokerage products or services provided by brokers may be used by KIA in servicing any or all of its clients, and such research products or services may not necessarily be used by KIA in connection with client accounts which paid commissions to the brokers providing such product or service. In recognition of these factors, clients may pay higher commissions to brokers than might be charged if a different broker had been selected, if, in KIA s opinion, this policy furthers the objective of obtaining best price and execution. In addition, KIA does not modify or reduce its fees based on the amount of brokerage or research services it receives from soft dollar transactions. Generally, the accounts that pay the commissions that may compensate in part for investment research are non-institutional accounts housed at RBC Capital Markets, LLC (RBC) without client direction of brokerage. These noninstitutional accounts may experience potentially inferior trade executions. In the event KIA obtains products or services on a soft dollar basis for a mixed-use (e.g., for both research and non-research purposes), KIA will make a reasonable allocation of the cost between that portion which is eligible as research and that portion which is not so qualified. The portion 1314 eligible as research may be paid for with soft dollars and the non-eligible portion will be paid for with KIA s own funds. This allocation decision may present a conflict of interest to KIA because it is deciding how much the firm will pay in cash. KIA s compliance procedures require that such allocations be made in good faith. Directed Brokerage Clients may designate, in writing, a broker through which securities transactions should be effected for their accounts. KIA views the designation of a broker by the client as an implicit direction of commissions generated by the client account. Designation of a broker may cause the client to pay higher transaction fees than otherwise may be available. In addition, KIA may not be authorized under those circumstances to negotiate commissions and may not be able to obtain volume discounts or best execution. Under these circumstances, a disparity in commission charges may exist between the commissions charged to clients who direct KIA to use a particular broker and those clients who do not. Accordingly, directed brokerage may cost you more money. When a client has directed KIA to provide a given amount of commissions to a specific broker in return for the provision of a service by that broker to the client (i.e., a step-out transaction), KIA will follow directions in such manner as it deems to be consistent with its contractual and legal responsibilities. Clients should consider the implications of any fiduciary laws, including ERISA, applicable to such clients prior to designating a broker for execution of trades. Step-Out Brokerage Transactions KIA may engage in step-out brokerage transactions subject to best price and execution. Generally, in a step-out transaction, KIA directs a trade to a broker with an instruction to execute the transaction, but step-out a portion of the transaction to a second broker who clears and settles that portion of the trade. Each broker in a step-out transaction receives a commission based on that portion of the transaction that it clears and settles. KIA may engage in step-out transactions to satisfy directed brokerage arrangements for its client accounts, to pay commissions to brokers who supply research services to KIA and/or to improve trade execution. KIA may have an incentive to engage in step-out transactions to generate additional commissions or soft dollars, which may create a conflict of interest. However, KIA monitors this potential conflict of interest through its Brokerage Committee, which reviews all trading practices. Trade Allocation and Aggregation KIA renders investment management advice to clients who may or may not have investment policies or objectives similar to those of other clients. Decisions as to purchases and sales are made separately for each client account. There can be no assurance that a particular investment opportunity that comes to the attention of KIA will be allocated in any particular manner. In making such decisions, certain factors considered by KIA include: the respective investment objectives and risk tolerance; the relative size of portfolio holdings of the same or comparable securities; the availability of cash for investment; and the size of investment commitments generally held. 1415 Clients should expect dispersion in investment performance among individual accounts and between any individual account and a composite of individual accounts. Occasionally, KIA has the opportunity on a very limited basis to acquire shares sold through IPOs, PIPEs or similar types of registered or unregistered transactions. KIA s policy is to allocate such shares among eligible accounts in its Emerging Opportunities Strategy based on criteria such as available cash, existing positions and brokerage restrictions. While KIA makes investment decisions for each of its client accounts on an individual basis, and trades accordingly, KIA may determine that a securities transaction is in the best interest of more than one account. In this situation, KIA may decide to combine orders for various accounts into a block trade that may be effected either in one transaction or in several discrete transactions over a period of time. In the latter case, the combined order may be executed at more than one price. Allocation decisions will be made fairly and equitably as to all clients. While commission costs may be generally lower, the contemporaneous purchase or sale of the same securities by client accounts could have detrimental effects on accounts, as such purchases or sales may affect the price paid or received or the size of the position obtainable by each. Certain clients may not be included in certain aggregated transactions because of cash availability, tax consequences or other factors. In addition, to avoid potential conflicts of interest, KIA s policy is generally to not aggregate trades for proprietary and related accounts with those of client accounts. Cross Trades Under certain circumstances, such as closing an account, a change in client asset allocation or a desire to raise cash in an account, KIA may order the purchase and sale of a security for different accounts on the same day at approximately the same time. An account s need to liquidate a stock may necessitate selling a security that is attractive to another client account. Such coincident trades may be deemed cross trades by regulators. KIA will not receive any compensation (other than our advisory fee) in connection with any such trades. Such trades will be effected only if, in KIA s judgment, the transaction is beneficial to both the client account(s) selling the security and the client account(s) purchasing the security. The ability to effect a cross transaction between client accounts may be a conflict of interest for KIA and present a conflicting division of loyalty because it may provide KIA with an opportunity to advantage one client over another. KIA s current intention is for cross transactions to occur, if at all, on an infrequent basis notwithstanding this disclosure or any potential benefit to clients. Such transactions do not occur for clients governed by ERISA. Wrap Free Programs As discussed in Item 4, above, KIA may be retained under a wrap fee billing arrangement offered by unaffiliated financial services firms, such as investment advisers and brokers. For example, at the request of a client, a broker might arrange for retention of KIA as investment adviser, pay KIA s management fee on behalf of the client, monitor and evaluate KIA s performance, execute the client s portfolio transactions without separate commission charge, and provide custodial services for the client s assets, or provide any combination of these or similar services, for an all-inclusive fee paid by the client to the broker. In evaluating such a billing arrangement, a client should recognize that brokerage commissions for the execution of transactions in the client s account by that broker are not negotiated by KIA. Transactions are 1516 effected without separate commissions, and a portion of the wrap fee may be considered as a feein-lieu-of-commissions. The client should also consider that, depending upon the level of the wrap fee charged, the amount of the portfolio activity in the client s account, the custodial, trading and execution costs, and other factors, the wrap fee may or may not exceed the aggregate cost of such services (i) if they were to be provided separately and (ii) if KIA were free to negotiate commissions and to actively seek best price and execution of transactions for the client s account. Accounts managed by KIA generally have a lower portfolio turnover rate than accounts managed in other investment styles. Generally KIA s advisory fee for a wrap fee account is paid to KIA directly by the broker. KIA does not receive any portion of the broker s remuneration. In certain cases, the broker may receive a portion of KIA s advisory fee. The custodial broker will generally act as the broker with respect to transactions placed by KIA on the client s behalf and may, if permitted by law, act as principal or as agent for a wrap fee client while also representing another of its customers in the transaction. Because the client pays a fee that covers commissions and other trading costs at the custodial broker, to avoid redundant expense, it is contemplated that KIA will place substantially all portfolio trades with or through the custodial broker. This fee arrangement may cause KIA not to search as actively among other brokers for best execution. In addition to transactional charges, including commissions, on trades placed with other brokers, a wrap fee generally does not cover, and the client pays separately for, among other things, bid-ask spreads, odd-lot differentials, exchange fees, transfer taxes, and money market fund fees, if applicable. Trade Errors As a fiduciary, KIA has the responsibility to effect trade orders correctly, promptly and in the best interests of our clients. In the event any error occurs in the handling of any client transactions, due to KIA s actions, or inaction, or actions of others, KIA s policy is to seek to identify and correct any errors as promptly as possible without disadvantaging the client or benefiting KIA in any way. If the error is the responsibility of KIA, any client transaction will be corrected and KIA will be responsible for any client loss resulting from an inaccurate or erroneous order. Generally an error resulting in a benefit to a client account, which cannot be corrected, will inure to the benefit of the client. Item 13 - Review of Accounts Typically, client portfolios are reviewed on an ongoing basis as a matter of practice rather than pursuant to a triggering factor. KIA is not a financial planner. KIA manages assets allocated to it by the client and/or the client s financial professional generally for long-term capital appreciation. KIA s Chief Investment Officer, LeRoy C. Kopp, supervises the firm s portfolio managers. The portfolio managers supervise securities selection and oversee portfolio reviews, with assistance from research analysts and administrative personnel. The number of portfolios assigned to a portfolio manager varies depending on the size and nature of the portfolio. Managed accounts will be periodically re-balanced during the normal portfolio review process. 1617 Clients receive quarterly written account appraisals and performance reports from KIA, including percentage gain or loss (time weighted calculations) and a year-to-date summary of realized gains and losses. KIA communicates strategy through periodic newsletters, telephone calls, personal consultations, electronic communications and client meetings. Special reports may be prepared to meet specific client requirements. Clients also receive account statements from their custodian at least quarterly. Item 14 - Client Referrals and Other Compensation Other than the soft dollar benefits disclosed in Item 12, above, and as otherwise disclosed in this Item 14, KIA does not receive commissions or any other economic benefit from a non-client in connection with providing advice to clients. KIA may compensate persons who solicit clients for the investment advisory services provided by KIA based on fees received by KIA with respect to the client referred. KIA will comply with Rule 206(4)-3 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, with respect to the payment of such fees. KIA may from time to time sponsor charitable or industry events at the request of an organization or individual that has referred a client to KIA, or KIA may provide gifts of value (including charitable donations) to organizations or individuals that refer clients to KIA. Item 15 - Custody KIA does not act as custodian for any client accounts; however, KIA may be deemed to have custody to the extent that it may deduct advisory fees from a client s account. All clients must appoint a qualified custodian, such as a broker, bank or trust company, to have possession of the assets of the account, to settle transactions for the account and to accept instructions from KIA regarding the assets in the account. All clients receive quarterly account statements directly from the custodian. Please compare the information in the quarterly account appraisals and performance reports prepared by KIA with the information in the account statements provided by the custodian. Item 16 - Investment Discretion In most cases, KIA is granted a limited power of attorney as part of the investment management agreement to trade securities in managed accounts. Accordingly, KIA generally exercises investment discretion as to securities purchased and sold and the amount of such transactions within the guidelines set forth in Item 8, above. Investment limitations may be placed by the client as outlined in the investment management agreement or an investment policy statement or client questionnaire. Item 17 - Voting Client Securities Unless otherwise agreed in writing, KIA will vote proxy ballots for securities held as client accounts. KIA will vote all proxies in the best interest of clients. Generally, KIA supports management on proxy proposals, but compensation and control proposals in particular are scrutinized and opposed if not in the best interests of shareholders. Should an issuer proposal involve a material conflict of interest between KIA and its clients, KIA will follow the guidelines contained in its proxy voting policies and procedures designed to mitigate or eliminate the conflict including: 1718 voting the securities based on a pre-determined voting guideline if the application of that guideline to the matter presented involves little discretion on the part of KIA; voting the securities based upon the recommendations of an independent third party, such as a proxy voting service; referring the proxy to the client or to a fiduciary of the client for voting purposes; suggesting that the client engage another party to determine how the proxy should be voted; or disclosing the conflict to the client and obtaining the client s direction to vote the proxies. In voting proxies, KIA uses a third-party service platform to provide administrative assistance, including certain record-keeping and reporting functions. A complete copy of KIA s proxy voting policies and procedures, as well as information as to how KIA voted proxies on your behalf, is available upon written request. Item 18 - Financial Information KIA does not have any financial condition that would impair our ability to meet contractual commitments to clients. A balance sheet is not required to be provided because we do not require prepayment of more than $1,200 in fees per client, six months or more in advance. Item 19 - Additional Information Legal Proceedings KIA will not act for clients in any legal proceedings, including bankruptcies or class actions, involving securities either held or previously held in accounts or the issuers of such securities. Clients are responsible for knowing the rights and terms of the securities in their account and for taking action to realize the value of advantageous transactions. Succession Planning LeRoy C. Kopp is the sole owner and Chairman, President and Chief Investment Officer of KIA. Mr. Kopp s ownership interest in KIA is held indirectly through a revocable business trust (the Trust ) for which he currently serves as the sole trustee. KIA has an experienced management team and structure in place that provides continuity beyond any one individual. In the event that Mr. Kopp is no longer able to continue working, either because of his death or for some other reason, the current management team that clients count on now to successfully guide their investment strategy will continue as it is today and the KIA management team will report to the Trust s trustee(s), which will include family representation. 1819 Revised March 2011 PRIVACY NOTICE FACTS Why?

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Are We There Yet? Evidence Points to No

With the summer road-trip season under way, drivers are hearing the familiar question “Are we there yet?” from the backseat of their automobiles. The same question is being asked about the stock market as indices are at record highs and returns in the first half of 2017 have been good. Unlike a summer road trip to a national park, campground, or cabin, the stock market does not have a known destination so it is difficult to identify when the market is at a peak. But there are signs to help investors understand where we are in the market cycle. As we look at these signs, we see potential for additional market upside.
In the first six months of year, the S&P 500 Index (S&P 500) hit 24 new all-time highs and increased 9.3%. Small cap stocks as measured by the Russell 2000 Index (Russell 2000) hit 9 new all-time highs and increased 5.0% during the same period. Breaking down the S&P 500’s year-to-date returns shows that the market returns have been driven more by multiple expansion (2017 price/earnings ratio up 9.6% YTD) than by earnings revisions (declined 1.2% YTD) or dividends (1.1%). However, this doesn’t mean that earnings growth is weak. In fact, as noted by FactSet, the total earnings of the S&P 500 are expected to increase 10% in 2017 (over 2016) and another 11% in 2018 (over 2017). If favorable stock market returns were driven only by higher valuations, we would be more concerned. But with corporate earnings growing at a double-digit rate, this suggests a healthy economic backdrop.
Perhaps the biggest wild card right now is corporate tax reform as U.S. corporate tax rates are among the highest in the developed world. U.S. companies typically realize some profits from outside the U.S., reducing their overall effective tax rate somewhat from the estimated rate shown in the chart on the right. But a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax from the existing 35% level could lead to higher corporate earnings, likely a tailwind for U.S. stock prices.

          Also giving us confidence in our positive outlook is the relatively low probability of a recession in the near term. Admittedly the U.S. is not in the early part of the business cycle as the U.S. has had only two quarters of negative real GDP growth over the last eight years, including none in the last three years. Looking forward, however, popular measures of recession likelihood from the New York Fed and academia put the chance of a recession in the next year at less than 10%. If the likelihood of recession is low and earnings growth is accelerating, we believe the odds favor new highs in the equity markets despite a bull market that seems long in the tooth. As an old Wall Street adage says, “Bull markets don’t die of old age.”
We believe the market has further room to run, but we also need to be mindful of the risks to our positive outlook. The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates twice already this year and plans to gradually reduce the size of its balance sheet beginning later this year. In our view, the Fed’s actions have been prudent. But the Fed or other central banks tightening too much or too soon would not be favorable for asset prices. Other risks to our positive outlook would include escalating global tensions. Overall, we have had a strong start to the year and are pleased to have delivered strong performance for our clients. As we enter the second half of the year, the signs we monitor suggest the potential for additional gains ahead.
