HomeAboutContactClassesCalendarMedia















Dan Burwell and Patrick “Pat” Cronin have joined to offer NRA Pistol courses as well as competition shooting courses geared toward either IDPA or USPSA competitors.  While the shooting skills are transferable between sports, the stage preparation and rules are different.Dan and Pat have both been life long hunters and shooters.  With their passion for shooting once they found competitive shooting sports, they were hooked.  It offers a way to test your limits as well as give you a more focused reason to spend time on the range practicing.  All of these elements are covered during their competition courses.Dan's wife Sharon Burwell, also an accomplished competition shooter and certified NRA instructor, adds the female perspective to each class she teaches. She teaches along side the guys or is available for ladies only classes.

Construction of a big firearm and archery range complex north of Pittsburgh is expected to begin in early 2017 and it's aiming to open next fall.
Ellwand Shooting Sports Academy LLC said on Monday that the Buncher Co. will build a 177,000-square-foot facility on 6.8 acres at Jackson’s Pointe Commerce Park in Jackson Township.

Ellwand also has begun raising $9 million through a private placement, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that was confirmed by Dave Gemperle, Ellwand president. He could not discuss further details about the fundraising.




The complex, in the works for several years, is to include firearm and archery bays, a restaurant and retail space, classrooms, membership lounges, a fully staffed gunsmith shop and business conference center. It is to employ about 40 instructors.
Ellwand will lease the building for 20 years with various options. Buncher engaged FJ Baehr Architects LLC to design the facility shell and work its staff to prepare engineering analysis and supporting research.
The plans will be then be presented for review to Jackson Township for approval with the goal of having all required permits to begin work in early 2017, Gemperle said.
The academy had originally been planned for Cranberry Township and was approved by its commissioners in April 2014. But principals decided to change developers and locations, partly for customer convenience.
