These maps provide a predicted high-level approximation of wireless coverage. There are gaps in coverage that are not shown by this high-level approximation. Actual coverage may differ from map graphics and may be affected by terrain, weather, network changes, foliage, buildings, construction, signal strength, high-usage periods, customer equipment, and other factors. AT&T does not guarantee coverage. Our coverage maps are not intended to show actual customer performance on the network or future network needs or build requirements inside or outside of existing AT&T coverage areas. Coverage maps may include areas served by unaffiliated carriers. Arrangements with these carriers may change from time to time, and coverage is subject to change without notice. Charges will be based on the location of the site receiving and transmitting the call, not the subscriber's location. Your phone's display does not indicate the rate you will be charged.

Questions? We have answers.





 What happened to 2-year service contracts that included subsidies?


				AT&T does not offer 2-year service contracts on smartphones.








 Do I own the smartphone? Or is this a leasing offer?


				The smartphone is yours, and you're responsible for the monthly installment payments. You're also responsible for any loss, theft, or damage to the smartphone—both during the installment agreement period and afterward. We recommend you purchase the optional mobile insurance to protect your investment.

















 Can I purchase any smartphone with AT&T Next or AT&T Next Every Year?


				Yes, AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year are available purchase options with any smartphone.








 Can I pay off my smartphone early?


				Yes, you have the option to pay off the remaining balance of your installment agreement in full at any time.
































 What is AT&T Next® and AT&T Next Every Year℠? 
		

AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year offer well-qualified buyers the choice to purchase a smartphone for $0 down, dividing the retail price of the smartphone into low monthly installment payments. For other customers, a down payment of 30% may be required and the remainder of the retail price will be divided into low monthly installment payments. For any option, you may choose to make an optional down payment in order to have lower monthly installment payments.
More information about the options:
AT&T Next: 30 monthly installments; eligible for an early upgrade with eligible trade-in when 80% of the full retail price is paid off (approximately 24 months). A 30% down payment may be required.
AT&T Next Every Year: 24 monthly installments; eligible for an early upgrade with eligible trade-in when 50% of the full retail price is paid off (approximately 12 months). A 30% down payment may be required.
Both plans require you to pay tax at sale and have eligible wireless service during the term of your installment agreement. If you cancel your wireless service on the line with an installment agreement, the device balance will become due.






 Will I be required to pay a lump sum up front to purchase a smartphone with AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year? 
		

Usually, no. However, some buyers will only qualify for AT&T Next or AT&T Next Every Year with a 30% down payment. Taxes on the full retail price are also due at time of sale.






 Is a contract required with AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year? 
		

AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year require that you sign an installment agreement to pay for the smartphone in monthly installment payments. During the term of your installment agreement you must have eligible voice & data wireless service on your line for your smartphone. If you cancel your wireless service, the remaining unpaid balance on the smartphone is due. Also, a month to month wireless customer agreement for your wireless service or qualified business agreement is required.






 When I trade in my smartphone and get a new one, what's the length of my new installment plan? 
		

You can chose the length of your new installment plan based on currently available offers.
Remember, once you are upgrade eligible, you can trade in an eligible smartphone (or one of the same make and model) in good physical, and fully functional condition, and upgrade to a new device with qualified service.






 What if I don't want to trade in and upgrade my smartphone and I want to keep it? 
		

You don't have to trade in your smartphone. You can continue to make your monthly installment payments until your installment agreement is fulfilled.






 What if the smartphone isn't in good working condition when it's time to trade it in? 
		

If you have mobile insurance, you may file a claim and pay the deductible for a replacement smartphone, then use your replacement smartphone as your AT&T Next or AT&T Next Every Year trade-in. Or, you may choose to just keep your smartphone and complete all installment payments. Once all payments have been made, you can upgrade to a new smartphone.






 Can I upgrade my smartphone on installment earlier than the term of my installment agreement? 
		

Yes, you can. You can take advantage of our pay-to-upgrade option after you've made two installment payments. You can take advantage of this option, as long as your account is in good standing.
You will need to make a lump sum payment equal to the balance remaining to become upgrade eligible. Please note that to trade in your smartphone, it must be fully functional and in good physical condition.






 When can I upgrade with AT&T Next or AT&T Next Every Year? 
		

After you have been billed and made two monthly installment payments, as long as your account is in good standing, you are eligible to take advantage of our pay-to-upgrade option.
For AT&T Next, pay a lump sum amount that fulfills 80% of the retail price in order to upgrade with eligible trade-in. For AT&T Next Every Year, pay a lump sum amount that fulfills 50% of the retail price in order to upgrade with eligible trade-in.
Please note that to trade in your smartphone, it must be fully functional and in good physical condition.






 What payments are due if I cancel AT&T Next or AT&T Next Every Year? 
		

With AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year, if you cancel your wireless service with AT&T, the full outstanding balance on your installment agreement becomes immediately due.






 How do I trade in my smartphone to upgrade to a new smartphone? 
		

Once you have reached upgrade eligibility, you can trade in your eligible smartphone (or one of the same make and model) in good physical, and fully functional, condition to upgrade. This means:

It must power on and off.
The screen must be intact, free of any chips, and function properly.
The device must be free of breaks or cracks.
The battery must be included.
The activation lock, such as the one needed for Find My iPhone, has been disabled.

History[edit]
2005–2011: Founding and company beginnings[edit]
NQ Mobile was founded in 2005 by Dr. Henry Lin, formerly the youngest associate professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Dr. Vincent Shi.[3] The company began its business by offering mobile security services and later started offering productivity products to families and enterprise customers. Their services are compatible with a wide range of handset models and almost all currently available operating systems for smartphones, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. NQ Mobile also collaborates closely with other mobile ecosystem participants, including chipmakers, handset manufacturers, wireless carriers, third party payment channels, retailers and other distribution channels in order to broaden the reach of their services.
NQ Mobile's initial focus was the China market place. The company cooperated with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three largest mobile companies in China. NQ Mobile also cooperated with Nokia and Sony to pre-installed NQ products on their companywide mobile phones. NQ Mobile has also worked closely with Symbian, Windows Mobile and Android, developing mobile security applications based on those operating systems. In addition, Samsung, Motorola, Dopod, Lenovo, Tencent, and Baidu have all been the company’s partners.
In August 2011, Chris Stier was appointed Managing Director for the Americas and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development throughout the Americas, overseeing sales and marketing operations as well as establishing strategic partnerships with key industry players in the region.[4]
In October 2011, Geoff Casely was appointed Managing Director for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region based in London and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development in EMEA and building strategic partner relationships.[5]

Omar Khan joined the company in January 2012 as co-CEO to direct the Company alongside the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Henry Lin and the company changed its corporate name from NetQin Mobile Inc. to NQ Mobile Inc.[6] Mr. Khan focused on the global expansion of NQ Mobile into markets such as North America, Latin America, Europe, Japan, Korea and India. Dr. Lin continued to focus on the core markets such as China and Taiwan among other developing countries.
During the first half of 2012, NQ Mobile expanded its international management with the additions of Gavin Kim as Chief Product Officer,[7] Conrad Edwards as Chief Experience Officer, and Victoria Repice as Senior Director of Product Management.[8]
NQ Mobile expanded its mobile internet services in November 2012 with the acquisition of Feiliu.[9] Feiliu was founded in 2009 and was subsequently rebranded to FL Mobile. It is a leading mobile interest-based community platform with coverage in China that engages users in real-time mobile online activities. FL Mobile provides application recommendation services, interest-based exchanges, and mobile games to its user communities. According to data published by third party marketing research company Sino MR, FL Mobile was the top iOS mobile game publisher and operator in the Chinese market in December 2012.[10] FL Mobile had 87.3 million registered users and 16.1 million monthly active users by the end of June 2013.[11]
EnfoDesk Analysys International (EnfoDesk), a major market tracking company, reported that FL Mobile became the number one publisher on the iOS platform and increased its market share to 36.6 percent in the first half of 2013.[12] The first-place ranking included the top spot for both revenues and number of mobile users. The report also claims FL Mobile ranks third place across all platforms for both revenues and mobile users and maintains 18.8 percent share of total revenues in the first half of the 2013.
NQ Mobile also expanded into enterprise security products and services starting in May 2012 when it acquired 55%[13] of NationSky and the remaining 45%[14] in July 2013.

In October 2013, NQ's stock “fell a shattering 47 percent”, followed by lawsuits. The short-seller research firm Muddy Waters LLC alleged that "at least 72 percent of the company’s revenue in China is fictitious and that its actual market share in China is 1.5 percent instead of 55 percent that it had claimed".[56] An independent investigation conducted by an independent special committee of its Board of Directors and carried out by its independent counsel Shearman & Sterling LLP and Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services Limited acting as forensic accountants found the companies disclosures were verifiable and investors argued that the company and shareholders should sue Muddy Waters for its unfounded claims.[57]

History[edit]
2005–2011: Founding and company beginnings[edit]
NQ Mobile was founded in 2005 by Dr. Henry Lin, formerly the youngest associate professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Dr. Vincent Shi.[3] The company began its business by offering mobile security services and later started offering productivity products to families and enterprise customers. Their services are compatible with a wide range of handset models and almost all currently available operating systems for smartphones, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. NQ Mobile also collaborates closely with other mobile ecosystem participants, including chipmakers, handset manufacturers, wireless carriers, third party payment channels, retailers and other distribution channels in order to broaden the reach of their services.
NQ Mobile's initial focus was the China market place. The company cooperated with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three largest mobile companies in China. NQ Mobile also cooperated with Nokia and Sony to pre-installed NQ products on their companywide mobile phones. NQ Mobile has also worked closely with Symbian, Windows Mobile and Android, developing mobile security applications based on those operating systems. In addition, Samsung, Motorola, Dopod, Lenovo, Tencent, and Baidu have all been the company’s partners.

In October 2013, NQ's stock “fell a shattering 47 percent”, followed by lawsuits. The short-seller research firm Muddy Waters LLC alleged that "at least 72 percent of the company’s revenue in China is fictitious and that its actual market share in China is 1.5 percent instead of 55 percent that it had claimed".[56] An independent investigation conducted by an independent special committee of its Board of Directors and carried out by its independent counsel Shearman & Sterling LLP and Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services Limited acting as forensic accountants found the companies disclosures were verifiable and investors argued that the company and shareholders should sue Muddy Waters for its unfounded claims.[57]

History[edit]
2005–2011: Founding and company beginnings[edit]
NQ Mobile was founded in 2005 by Dr. Henry Lin, formerly the youngest associate professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Dr. Vincent Shi.[3] The company began its business by offering mobile security services and later started offering productivity products to families and enterprise customers. Their services are compatible with a wide range of handset models and almost all currently available operating systems for smartphones, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. NQ Mobile also collaborates closely with other mobile ecosystem participants, including chipmakers, handset manufacturers, wireless carriers, third party payment channels, retailers and other distribution channels in order to broaden the reach of their services.
NQ Mobile's initial focus was the China market place. The company cooperated with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three largest mobile companies in China. NQ Mobile also cooperated with Nokia and Sony to pre-installed NQ products on their companywide mobile phones. NQ Mobile has also worked closely with Symbian, Windows Mobile and Android, developing mobile security applications based on those operating systems. In addition, Samsung, Motorola, Dopod, Lenovo, Tencent, and Baidu have all been the company’s partners.

EnfoDesk Analysys International (EnfoDesk), a major market tracking company, reported that FL Mobile became the number one publisher on the iOS platform and increased its market share to 36.6 percent in the first half of 2013.[12] The first-place ranking included the top spot for both revenues and number of mobile users. The report also claims FL Mobile ranks third place across all platforms for both revenues and mobile users and maintains 18.8 percent share of total revenues in the first half of the 2013.

History[edit]
2005–2011: Founding and company beginnings[edit]
NQ Mobile was founded in 2005 by Dr. Henry Lin, formerly the youngest associate professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Dr. Vincent Shi.[3] The company began its business by offering mobile security services and later started offering productivity products to families and enterprise customers. Their services are compatible with a wide range of handset models and almost all currently available operating systems for smartphones, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. NQ Mobile also collaborates closely with other mobile ecosystem participants, including chipmakers, handset manufacturers, wireless carriers, third party payment channels, retailers and other distribution channels in order to broaden the reach of their services.
NQ Mobile's initial focus was the China market place. The company cooperated with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three largest mobile companies in China. NQ Mobile also cooperated with Nokia and Sony to pre-installed NQ products on their companywide mobile phones. NQ Mobile has also worked closely with Symbian, Windows Mobile and Android, developing mobile security applications based on those operating systems. In addition, Samsung, Motorola, Dopod, Lenovo, Tencent, and Baidu have all been the company’s partners.
In August 2011, Chris Stier was appointed Managing Director for the Americas and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development throughout the Americas, overseeing sales and marketing operations as well as establishing strategic partnerships with key industry players in the region.[4]

According to data published by third party marketing research company Sino MR, FL Mobile was the top iOS mobile game publisher and operator in the Chinese market in December 2012.[10] FL Mobile had 87.3 million registered users and 16.1 million monthly active users by the end of June 2013.[11]
EnfoDesk Analysys International (EnfoDesk), a major market tracking company, reported that FL Mobile became the number one publisher on the iOS platform and increased its market share to 36.6 percent in the first half of 2013.[12] The first-place ranking included the top spot for both revenues and number of mobile users. The report also claims FL Mobile ranks third place across all platforms for both revenues and mobile users and maintains 18.8 percent share of total revenues in the first half of the 2013.

History[edit]
2005–2011: Founding and company beginnings[edit]
NQ Mobile was founded in 2005 by Dr. Henry Lin, formerly the youngest associate professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Dr. Vincent Shi.[3] The company began its business by offering mobile security services and later started offering productivity products to families and enterprise customers. Their services are compatible with a wide range of handset models and almost all currently available operating systems for smartphones, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. NQ Mobile also collaborates closely with other mobile ecosystem participants, including chipmakers, handset manufacturers, wireless carriers, third party payment channels, retailers and other distribution channels in order to broaden the reach of their services.
NQ Mobile's initial focus was the China market place. The company cooperated with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three largest mobile companies in China. NQ Mobile also cooperated with Nokia and Sony to pre-installed NQ products on their companywide mobile phones. NQ Mobile has also worked closely with Symbian, Windows Mobile and Android, developing mobile security applications based on those operating systems. In addition, Samsung, Motorola, Dopod, Lenovo, Tencent, and Baidu have all been the company’s partners.
In August 2011, Chris Stier was appointed Managing Director for the Americas and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development throughout the Americas, overseeing sales and marketing operations as well as establishing strategic partnerships with key industry players in the region.[4]
In October 2011, Geoff Casely was appointed Managing Director for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region based in London and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development in EMEA and building strategic partner relationships.[5]

NQ Mobile expanded its mobile internet services in November 2012 with the acquisition of Feiliu.[9] Feiliu was founded in 2009 and was subsequently rebranded to FL Mobile. It is a leading mobile interest-based community platform with coverage in China that engages users in real-time mobile online activities. FL Mobile provides application recommendation services, interest-based exchanges, and mobile games to its user communities. According to data published by third party marketing research company Sino MR, FL Mobile was the top iOS mobile game publisher and operator in the Chinese market in December 2012.[10] FL Mobile had 87.3 million registered users and 16.1 million monthly active users by the end of June 2013.[11]
EnfoDesk Analysys International (EnfoDesk), a major market tracking company, reported that FL Mobile became the number one publisher on the iOS platform and increased its market share to 36.6 percent in the first half of 2013.[12] The first-place ranking included the top spot for both revenues and number of mobile users. The report also claims FL Mobile ranks third place across all platforms for both revenues and mobile users and maintains 18.8 percent share of total revenues in the first half of the 2013.
NQ Mobile also expanded into enterprise security products and services starting in May 2012 when it acquired 55%[13] of NationSky and the remaining 45%[14] in July 2013.

("Showself") to provide entertainment and dating platforms on mobile internet, and established Beijing NQ Mobile Co., Ltd.

In May 2015, Mr. Zemin Xu[19] took over as CEO and the company held a press conference in Beijing to announce their new business strategy and reorganized along two lines, a technical division representing mobile security, mobile enterprise and mobile health care, and an entertainment division covering mobile advertising, mobile entertainment and mobile games.[20] During the conference NQ Mobile also announced its new Showself Entertainment brand which includes Showself, Showself Live Wallpaper, Showself Music Radar and Showself Launcher.[21] In June 2015, Mr. Roland Wu was appointed as Chief Financial Officer.[22]
In August 2015 the company along with the other existing shareholders of FL Mobile Inc. agreed to sell to Beijing Jinxing Rongda Investment Management Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co., Ltd, the entire stake in FL Mobile Inc. that they currently hold for no less than RMB 4 billion (or approximately no less than US $626 million) and also the sale of all of NQ Mobile's interest in Beijing NationSky Network Technology Co., Ltd., to Mr. Hou Shuli, a founder and senior management member of Beijing NationSky, for an aggregate consideration of US $80 million.[23] The company completed the divestment of NationSky for $80 million at the end of 2015.[24]

History[edit]
2005–2011: Founding and company beginnings[edit]
NQ Mobile was founded in 2005 by Dr. Henry Lin, formerly the youngest associate professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Dr. Vincent Shi.[3] The company began its business by offering mobile security services and later started offering productivity products to families and enterprise customers. Their services are compatible with a wide range of handset models and almost all currently available operating systems for smartphones, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. NQ Mobile also collaborates closely with other mobile ecosystem participants, including chipmakers, handset manufacturers, wireless carriers, third party payment channels, retailers and other distribution channels in order to broaden the reach of their services.
NQ Mobile's initial focus was the China market place. The company cooperated with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three largest mobile companies in China. NQ Mobile also cooperated with Nokia and Sony to pre-installed NQ products on their companywide mobile phones. NQ Mobile has also worked closely with Symbian, Windows Mobile and Android, developing mobile security applications based on those operating systems. In addition, Samsung, Motorola, Dopod, Lenovo, Tencent, and Baidu have all been the company’s partners.
In August 2011, Chris Stier was appointed Managing Director for the Americas and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development throughout the Americas, overseeing sales and marketing operations as well as establishing strategic partnerships with key industry players in the region.[4]
In October 2011, Geoff Casely was appointed Managing Director for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region based in London and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development in EMEA and building strategic partner relationships.[5]

Omar Khan joined the company in January 2012 as co-CEO to direct the Company alongside the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Henry Lin and the company changed its corporate name from NetQin Mobile Inc. to NQ Mobile Inc.[6] Mr. Khan focused on the global expansion of NQ Mobile into markets such as North America, Latin America, Europe, Japan, Korea and India.

NQ Mobile expanded its mobile internet services in November 2012 with the acquisition of Feiliu.[9] Feiliu was founded in 2009 and was subsequently rebranded to FL Mobile. It is a leading mobile interest-based community platform with coverage in China that engages users in real-time mobile online activities. FL Mobile provides application recommendation services, interest-based exchanges, and mobile games to its user communities. According to data published by third party marketing research company Sino MR, FL Mobile was the top iOS mobile game publisher and operator in the Chinese market in December 2012.[10] FL Mobile had 87.3 million registered users and 16.1 million monthly active users by the end of June 2013.[11]
EnfoDesk Analysys International (EnfoDesk), a major market tracking company, reported that FL Mobile became the number one publisher on the iOS platform and increased its market share to 36.6 percent in the first half of 2013.[12] The first-place ranking included the top spot for both revenues and number of mobile users. The report also claims FL Mobile ranks third place across all platforms for both revenues and mobile users and maintains 18.8 percent share of total revenues in the first half of the 2013.
NQ Mobile also expanded into enterprise security products and services starting in May 2012 when it acquired 55%[13] of NationSky and the remaining 45%[14] in July 2013. Founded in 2005, NationSky is a leader in providing mobile services to more than 1,250 enterprises in China.

("Yipai") to provide mobile intelligent interactive advertising services, through integration of media channels of outdoor, newspapers, magazines etc., Beijing Showself Technology Co., Ltd. ("Showself") to provide entertainment and dating platforms on mobile internet, and established Beijing NQ Mobile Co., Ltd. ("NQ Yizhuang") to engage in software design and development for computer and mobile devices and other technology consulting services.[18]

These maps provide a predicted high-level approximation of wireless coverage. There are gaps in coverage that are not shown by this high-level approximation. Actual coverage may differ from map graphics and may be affected by terrain, weather, network changes, foliage, buildings, construction, signal strength, high-usage periods, customer equipment, and other factors. AT&T does not guarantee coverage. Our coverage maps are not intended to show actual customer performance on the network or future network needs or build requirements inside or outside of existing AT&T coverage areas. Coverage maps may include areas served by unaffiliated carriers. Arrangements with these carriers may change from time to time, and coverage is subject to change without notice. Charges will be based on the location of the site receiving and transmitting the call, not the subscriber's location. Your phone's display does not indicate the rate you will be charged.

Questions? We have answers.





 What happened to 2-year service contracts that included subsidies?


				AT&T does not offer 2-year service contracts on smartphones.








 Do I own the smartphone? Or is this a leasing offer?


				The smartphone is yours, and you're responsible for the monthly installment payments. You're also responsible for any loss, theft, or damage to the smartphone—both during the installment agreement period and afterward. We recommend you purchase the optional mobile insurance to protect your investment.

















 Can I purchase any smartphone with AT&T Next or AT&T Next Every Year?


				Yes, AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year are available purchase options with any smartphone.








 Can I pay off my smartphone early?


				Yes, you have the option to pay off the remaining balance of your installment agreement in full at any time.
































 What is AT&T Next® and AT&T Next Every Year℠? 
		

AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year offer well-qualified buyers the choice to purchase a smartphone for $0 down, dividing the retail price of the smartphone into low monthly installment payments. For other customers, a down payment of 30% may be required and the remainder of the retail price will be divided into low monthly installment payments. For any option, you may choose to make an optional down payment in order to have lower monthly installment payments.
More information about the options:
AT&T Next: 30 monthly installments; eligible for an early upgrade with eligible trade-in when 80% of the full retail price is paid off (approximately 24 months). A 30% down payment may be required.
AT&T Next Every Year: 24 monthly installments; eligible for an early upgrade with eligible trade-in when 50% of the full retail price is paid off (approximately 12 months). A 30% down payment may be required.
Both plans require you to pay tax at sale and have eligible wireless service during the term of your installment agreement. If you cancel your wireless service on the line with an installment agreement, the device balance will become due.






 Will I be required to pay a lump sum up front to purchase a smartphone with AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year? 
		

Usually, no. However, some buyers will only qualify for AT&T Next or AT&T Next Every Year with a 30% down payment. Taxes on the full retail price are also due at time of sale.






 Is a contract required with AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year? 
		

AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year require that you sign an installment agreement to pay for the smartphone in monthly installment payments. During the term of your installment agreement you must have eligible voice & data wireless service on your line for your smartphone. If you cancel your wireless service, the remaining unpaid balance on the smartphone is due. Also, a month to month wireless customer agreement for your wireless service or qualified business agreement is required.






 When I trade in my smartphone and get a new one, what's the length of my new installment plan? 
		

You can chose the length of your new installment plan based on currently available offers.
Remember, once you are upgrade eligible, you can trade in an eligible smartphone (or one of the same make and model) in good physical, and fully functional condition, and upgrade to a new device with qualified service.






 What if I don't want to trade in and upgrade my smartphone and I want to keep it? 
		

You don't have to trade in your smartphone. You can continue to make your monthly installment payments until your installment agreement is fulfilled.






 What if the smartphone isn't in good working condition when it's time to trade it in? 
		

If you have mobile insurance, you may file a claim and pay the deductible for a replacement smartphone, then use your replacement smartphone as your AT&T Next or AT&T Next Every Year trade-in. Or, you may choose to just keep your smartphone and complete all installment payments. Once all payments have been made, you can upgrade to a new smartphone.






 Can I upgrade my smartphone on installment earlier than the term of my installment agreement? 
		

Yes, you can. You can take advantage of our pay-to-upgrade option after you've made two installment payments. You can take advantage of this option, as long as your account is in good standing.
You will need to make a lump sum payment equal to the balance remaining to become upgrade eligible. Please note that to trade in your smartphone, it must be fully functional and in good physical condition.






 When can I upgrade with AT&T Next or AT&T Next Every Year? 
		

After you have been billed and made two monthly installment payments, as long as your account is in good standing, you are eligible to take advantage of our pay-to-upgrade option.
For AT&T Next, pay a lump sum amount that fulfills 80% of the retail price in order to upgrade with eligible trade-in. For AT&T Next Every Year, pay a lump sum amount that fulfills 50% of the retail price in order to upgrade with eligible trade-in.
Please note that to trade in your smartphone, it must be fully functional and in good physical condition.






 What payments are due if I cancel AT&T Next or AT&T Next Every Year? 
		

With AT&T Next and AT&T Next Every Year, if you cancel your wireless service with AT&T, the full outstanding balance on your installment agreement becomes immediately due.






 How do I trade in my smartphone to upgrade to a new smartphone? 
		

Once you have reached upgrade eligibility, you can trade in your eligible smartphone (or one of the same make and model) in good physical, and fully functional, condition to upgrade. This means:

It must power on and off.
The screen must be intact, free of any chips, and function properly.
The device must be free of breaks or cracks.
The battery must be included.
The activation lock, such as the one needed for Find My iPhone, has been disabled.

History[edit]
2005–2011: Founding and company beginnings[edit]
NQ Mobile was founded in 2005 by Dr. Henry Lin, formerly the youngest associate professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Dr. Vincent Shi.[3] The company began its business by offering mobile security services and later started offering productivity products to families and enterprise customers. Their services are compatible with a wide range of handset models and almost all currently available operating systems for smartphones, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. NQ Mobile also collaborates closely with other mobile ecosystem participants, including chipmakers, handset manufacturers, wireless carriers, third party payment channels, retailers and other distribution channels in order to broaden the reach of their services.
NQ Mobile's initial focus was the China market place. The company cooperated with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three largest mobile companies in China. NQ Mobile also cooperated with Nokia and Sony to pre-installed NQ products on their companywide mobile phones. NQ Mobile has also worked closely with Symbian, Windows Mobile and Android, developing mobile security applications based on those operating systems. In addition, Samsung, Motorola, Dopod, Lenovo, Tencent, and Baidu have all been the company’s partners.
In August 2011, Chris Stier was appointed Managing Director for the Americas and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development throughout the Americas, overseeing sales and marketing operations as well as establishing strategic partnerships with key industry players in the region.[4]

EnfoDesk Analysys International (EnfoDesk), a major market tracking company, reported that FL Mobile became the number one publisher on the iOS platform and increased its market share to 36.6 percent in the first half of 2013.[12] The first-place ranking included the top spot for both revenues and number of mobile users. The report also claims FL Mobile ranks third place across all platforms for both revenues and mobile users and maintains 18.8 percent share of total revenues in the first half of the 2013.

In July 2013, NQ Mobile agrees to purchase the remaining 45 percent stake in its subsidiary, NationSky.[14] [53]
In September 2013, NQ Mobile announced the release of "Music Radar," a content-based music information retrieval (MIR) application from one of its subsidiaries, Yinlong making the app available in China for both Android and iOS platforms.[54] The app was later renamed Doreso.[55]
In October 2013, NQ's stock “fell a shattering 47 percent”, followed by lawsuits. The short-seller research firm Muddy Waters LLC alleged that "at least 72 percent of the company’s revenue in China is fictitious and that its actual market share in China is 1.5 percent instead of 55 percent that it had claimed".[56] An independent investigation conducted by an independent special committee of its Board of Directors and carried out by its independent counsel Shearman & Sterling LLP and Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services Limited acting as forensic accountants found the companies disclosures were verifiable and investors argued that the company and shareholders should sue Muddy Waters for its unfounded claims.[57]

History[edit]
2005–2011: Founding and company beginnings[edit]
NQ Mobile was founded in 2005 by Dr. Henry Lin, formerly the youngest associate professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Dr. Vincent Shi.[3] The company began its business by offering mobile security services and later started offering productivity products to families and enterprise customers. Their services are compatible with a wide range of handset models and almost all currently available operating systems for smartphones, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. NQ Mobile also collaborates closely with other mobile ecosystem participants, including chipmakers, handset manufacturers, wireless carriers, third party payment channels, retailers and other distribution channels in order to broaden the reach of their services.
NQ Mobile's initial focus was the China market place. The company cooperated with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three largest mobile companies in China. NQ Mobile also cooperated with Nokia and Sony to pre-installed NQ products on their companywide mobile phones. NQ Mobile has also worked closely with Symbian, Windows Mobile and Android, developing mobile security applications based on those operating systems. In addition, Samsung, Motorola, Dopod, Lenovo, Tencent, and Baidu have all been the company’s partners.
In August 2011, Chris Stier was appointed Managing Director for the Americas and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development throughout the Americas, overseeing sales and marketing operations as well as establishing strategic partnerships with key industry players in the region.[4]
In October 2011, Geoff Casely was appointed Managing Director for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region based in London and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development in EMEA and building strategic partner relationships.[5]
2012–2013: International expansion[edit]
Omar Khan joined the company in January 2012 as co-CEO to direct the Company alongside the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Henry Lin and the company changed its corporate name from NetQin Mobile Inc. to NQ Mobile Inc.[6] Mr. Khan focused on the global expansion of NQ Mobile into markets such as North America, Latin America, Europe, Japan, Korea and India. Dr. Lin continued to focus on the core markets such as China and Taiwan among other developing countries.
During the first half of 2012, NQ Mobile expanded its international management with the additions of Gavin Kim as Chief Product Officer,[7] Conrad Edwards as Chief Experience Officer, and Victoria Repice as Senior Director of Product Management.[8]
NQ Mobile expanded its mobile internet services in November 2012 with the acquisition of Feiliu.[9] Feiliu was founded in 2009 and was subsequently rebranded to FL Mobile. It is a leading mobile interest-based community platform with coverage in China that engages users in real-time mobile online activities. FL Mobile provides application recommendation services, interest-based exchanges, and mobile games to its user communities. According to data published by third party marketing research company Sino MR, FL Mobile was the top iOS mobile game publisher and operator in the Chinese market in December 2012.[10] FL Mobile had 87.3 million registered users and 16.1 million monthly active users by the end of June 2013.[11]
EnfoDesk Analysys International (EnfoDesk), a major market tracking company, reported that FL Mobile became the number one publisher on the iOS platform and increased its market share to 36.6 percent in the first half of 2013.[12] The first-place ranking included the top spot for both revenues and number of mobile users. The report also claims FL Mobile ranks third place across all platforms for both revenues and mobile users and maintains 18.8 percent share of total revenues in the first half of the 2013.
NQ Mobile also expanded into enterprise security products and services starting in May 2012 when it acquired 55%[13] of NationSky and the remaining 45%[14] in July 2013. Founded in 2005, NationSky is a leader in providing mobile services to more than 1,250 enterprises in China. By working with carriers and smart phone platform providers, NationSky delivers device agnostic managed mobile services, self developed mobile device management (MDM) software NQSky[15] and other mobile SaaS services. Headquartered in Beijing, NationSky also has offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
In June 2013, NQ Mobile hired Matt Mathison to the senior management position of Vice President, Capital Markets.[16]
In August 2013, NQ Mobile opened a second global headquarters in Dallas, Texas.[17] The company also further expanded its products and service offerings with the acquisitions of Shanghai Yinlong Information and Technology Co., Ltd. ("Yinlong") to develop content-based music information retrieval (MIR) technology based on multi platforms, NQ Mobile (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. ("NQ Shenzhen") to offer online security education and value added services, Best Partners Ltd. ("Best Partner") for mobile advertising, Beijing Tianya Co., Ltd. ("Tianya") for mobile healthcare applications development and search engine marketing in the healthcare industry in China, Chengdu Ruifeng Technology Co., Ltd. ("Ruifeng") to provide enterprise mobility system development and iOS training programs, Tianjin Huayong Wireless Technology Co., Ltd. ("Huayong ") for research and development and marketing of live wallpapers for smart phones using the Android operating system, and expanded its market with NQ Mobile KK ("NQ Japan") in Japan.[18]
2014–Present: Expansion cont. and new strategy[edit]
In 2014 NQ Mobile continued expanding through acquisitions with Beijing Trustek Technology Co., Ltd. ("Trustek") to provide enterprise mobility solutions and services, including system management, application development, business intelligence and maintenance services, Yipai Tianxia Network Technology Co., Ltd. ("Yipai") to provide mobile intelligent interactive advertising services, through integration of media channels of outdoor, newspapers, magazines etc., Beijing Showself Technology Co., Ltd. ("Showself") to provide entertainment and dating platforms on mobile internet, and established Beijing NQ Mobile Co., Ltd. ("NQ Yizhuang") to engage in software design and development for computer and mobile devices and other technology consulting services.[18]
In May 2015, Mr. Zemin Xu[19] took over as CEO and the company held a press conference in Beijing to announce their new business strategy and reorganized along two lines, a technical division representing mobile security, mobile enterprise and mobile health care, and an entertainment division covering mobile advertising, mobile entertainment and mobile games.[20] During the conference NQ Mobile also announced its new Showself Entertainment brand which includes Showself, Showself Live Wallpaper, Showself Music Radar and Showself Launcher.[21] In June 2015, Mr. Roland Wu was appointed as Chief Financial Officer.[22]
In August 2015 the company along with the other existing shareholders of FL Mobile Inc. agreed to sell to Beijing Jinxing Rongda Investment Management Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co., Ltd, the entire stake in FL Mobile Inc. that they currently hold for no less than RMB 4 billion (or approximately no less than US $626 million) and also the sale of all of NQ Mobile's interest in Beijing NationSky Network Technology Co., Ltd., to Mr. Hou Shuli, a founder and senior management member of Beijing NationSky, for an aggregate consideration of US $80 million.[23] The company completed the divestment of NationSky for $80 million at the end of 2015.[24]

History[edit]
2005–2011: Founding and company beginnings[edit]
NQ Mobile was founded in 2005 by Dr. Henry Lin, formerly the youngest associate professor at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Dr. Vincent Shi.[3] The company began its business by offering mobile security services and later started offering productivity products to families and enterprise customers. Their services are compatible with a wide range of handset models and almost all currently available operating systems for smartphones, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. NQ Mobile also collaborates closely with other mobile ecosystem participants, including chipmakers, handset manufacturers, wireless carriers, third party payment channels, retailers and other distribution channels in order to broaden the reach of their services.
NQ Mobile's initial focus was the China market place. The company cooperated with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three largest mobile companies in China. NQ Mobile also cooperated with Nokia and Sony to pre-installed NQ products on their companywide mobile phones. NQ Mobile has also worked closely with Symbian, Windows Mobile and Android, developing mobile security applications based on those operating systems. In addition, Samsung, Motorola, Dopod, Lenovo, Tencent, and Baidu have all been the company’s partners.
In August 2011, Chris Stier was appointed Managing Director for the Americas and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development throughout the Americas, overseeing sales and marketing operations as well as establishing strategic partnerships with key industry players in the region.[4]
In October 2011, Geoff Casely was appointed Managing Director for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region based in London and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development in EMEA and building strategic partner relationships.[5]

FL Mobile provides application recommendation services, interest-based exchanges, and mobile games to its user communities. According to data published by third party marketing research company Sino MR, FL Mobile was the top iOS mobile game publisher and operator in the Chinese market in December 2012.[10] FL Mobile had 87.3 million registered users and 16.1 million monthly active users by the end of June 2013.[11]
EnfoDesk Analysys International (EnfoDesk), a major market tracking company, reported that FL Mobile became the number one publisher on the iOS platform and increased its market share to 36.6 percent in the first half of 2013.[12] The first-place ranking included the top spot for both revenues and number of mobile users. The report also claims FL Mobile ranks third place across all platforms for both revenues and mobile users and maintains 18.8 percent share of total revenues in the first half of the 2013.
NQ Mobile also expanded into enterprise security products and services starting in May 2012 when it acquired 55%[13] of NationSky and the remaining 45%[14] in July 2013.

("Showself") to provide entertainment and dating platforms on mobile internet, and established Beijing NQ Mobile Co., Ltd.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
