History[edit]




Syngenta headquarters in Basel


Based in Basel, Switzerland, Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.[4][5] Its roots are considerably older.
Novartis was formed of the 1996 merger of the three Swiss companies:[6] Geigy, which has roots back to 1758;[7] Sandoz Laboratories which was founded in 1876;[citation needed] and Ciba, founded in 1884.[8] Ciba and Geigy had merged in 1971 and had concentrated mainly on crop protection in its agro division,[citation needed] Sandoz more on seeds.[citation needed]




Syngenta works in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire originally owned by ICI.


Zeneca Agrochemicals was part of AstraZeneca, and formerly of Imperial Chemical Industries. ICI was formed in the UK in 1926. Two years later, work began at the Agricultural Research Station at Jealotts Hill near Bracknell.[9]
In 2004, Syngenta Seeds purchased Garst, the North American corn and soybean business of Advanta, as well as Golden Harvest Seeds.[10][11] On 5 December 2004, the European Union ended a six-year moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by Monsanto and its Swiss rival, Syngenta.[12]
In 2005, Syngenta opposed a Swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms.[13] On 28 November 2005, Switzerland enacted a five-year ban on the farming of genetically modified crops, underscoring the problems facing the European Commission and biotech companies like Syngenta, Bayer and Monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety.[14]
As of 2014[update] Syngenta's main competitors are Monsanto Company, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.[15]
In 2014, Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta for a reported $40 billion, but Syngenta rejected the offer.[2][16] Since April 2015 Monsanto and Syngenta had been working with their investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs respectively on a deal. The U.S. Treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion.[17] Syngenta's Board of Directors rejected an even better offer by Monsanto during August 2015, and Monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on 26 August.[18]
According to the Swiss business weekly, Finanz und Wirtschaft, many Syngenta shareholders were enraged, both by the company's refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with Monsanto, and with the subsequent offer withdrawal.[19][20] This resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the Alliance of Critical Syngenta Shareholders, which urged the Board to "evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice".[21]
In a recent interview, Chairman Michel Demaré was asked whether Syngenta could remain independent. He responded, "If you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize, then it would be possible. But in these circumstances, where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price, what they think this company is worth, it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months."[22] He thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold, especially given industry consolidation, which is creating larger competitors.
The failed Monsanto buyout caused Syngenta shares to increase by nearly 40%. In February 2016, ChemChina, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, offered to purchase Syngenta for $43 billion (480 Swiss francs per share), a deal which the company "unanimously recommended to shareholders”.[23] In April 2017, the Federal Trade Commission, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the European Commissioner for Competition approved of the acquisition, allowing the largest foreign takeover in Chinese history to proceed.[24] To secure approval, ChemChina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin, and chlorothalonil.[25][26] As an additional condition for the acquisition, 67 percent of the shareholders of Syngenta had to offer their shares to ChemChina. According to a press release, over 80 percent of shareholders agreed to the takeover by May 4, 2017. Therefore, the transaction is planned to close on June 7, 2017.[27]

Products[edit]
Syngenta has eight primary product lines which it develops, markets and sells worldwide; Its five product lines for pesticides are selective herbicides, non-selective herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and seed care. Three product lines for seed products include corn and soya, other field crops and vegetables.[37][page needed] In 2014, sales from crop protection products accounted for US $11.381 billion, i.e. 75% of total sales.[38][page needed] Field crop seeds include both hybrid seeds and genetically engineered seeds, some of which enter the food chain and become part of genetically modified food. According to Syngenta, in the US their "proprietary triple stack corn seeds expanded to represent around 25 percent of units sold." [39] In 2010, the US EPA approved insecticidal trait stacks including Syngenta's AGRISURE VIPTERA™ gene, which offers resistance to certain corn pests.[39] Syngenta cross-licenses its proprietary genes with Dow AgroSciences and thus is able to include Dow's Herculex I and Herculex RW insect resistance traits in its seeds.[39] It sells a VMAX soybean that is resistant to glyphosate herbicide.[39]
Key Syngenta brands include Actara (Thiamethoxam), Agrisure (corn with Viptera trait), Alto (Cyproconazole), Amistar (azoxystrobin), Avicta, Axial, Bicep II, Bravo, Callisto, Celest, Cruiser (TMX, Thiamethoxam), Dividend, Dual, Durivo, Elatus, Fusilade, Force, Golden Harvest, Gramoxone, Hilleshoeg, Karate, Northrup-King (NK), Proclaim, Revus, Ridomil, Rogers, Score, Seguris, S&G, Tilt, Topik, Touchdown, Vertimec and Vibrance.[37]
Current products[edit]
Atrazine is an herbicide of the triazine class. Atrazine is used to prevent pre- and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.
It is one of the most widely used herbicides in US[40] and Australian agriculture.[41] Atrazine has been banned in the European Union.[42] There has been controversy over atrazine's effects on amphibians,[42] but the EPA has concluded "that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development".[43]
The European Commission decided to suspend use of the company's insecticide Cruiser (thiamethoxam, TMX) on crops pollinated by bees.[44] Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.[45]
Former products[edit]
Syngenta's predecessor, Ciba-Geigy, introduced the insecticide Galecron chlordimeform in 1966, and it was removed from the market in 1988.[46] In 1976, Ciba-Geigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing long-term toxicology studies - particularly studies to determine if long-term exposure could cause cancer - showed that it was causing cancer, and that it has already started to monitor its workers' exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers.[47]:8–9 Ciba-Geigy then applied for, and was granted, permission to market Galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton.[48] However, as further long term monitoring data was obtained, regulators banned chlordimeform in 1988. In a 1995 class action in the US, Ciba-Geigy agreed to cover costs for employee health monitoring and treatment. In 2005, Syngenta reported that employee health monitoring was continuing at the company's Monthey, Switzerland site.[49]
Biofuels[edit]
Like many agriculture companies, Syngenta also works in the biofuel space. In 2011, it announced the corn trait ENOGEN to reduce substantially the consumption of water and energy versus conventional corn.[50] Several ethanol producers plan to process such improved corn.[37] For example, Syngenta has signed a commercial agreement with Three Rivers Energy, LLC of Coshocton, Ohio, US to use grain featuring Enogen trait technology following the 2014 corn harvest.[51]
In 2007, Queensland University in Australia contracted with Syngenta to research different inputs for biofuels as a renewable energy source.[52]
Corporate structure[edit]
Syngenta is led by CEO J. Erik Fyrwald. The other Directors are Vinita Bali, Stefan Borgas, Gunnar Brock, David Lawrence, Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Eveline Saupper, Jacques Vincent, and Jürg Witmer.[37] Syngenta is listed on both the Swiss stock exchange and in New York.[37][page needed] Syngenta employs over 28,000 people in over 90 countries.[citation needed]
Litigation[edit]
In 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Syngenta which had filed a suit against Bayer for patent infringement on a class of neonicotinoid insecticides. The following year Syngenta filed suits against Monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its U.S. biotechnology patents covering genetically modified corn and cotton. In 2004, it again filed a suit against Monsanto, claiming antitrust violations related to the U.S. biotech corn seed market, and Monsanto countersued. Monsanto and Syngenta settled all litigation in 2008.[53]
Syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of Greenville, Illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies. The suit was settled for $105 million in May 2012.[54][55][56] A similar case involving six states has been in federal court since 2010.[57][58]
In the US, Syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding Viptera genetically modified corn. The plaintiffs in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports.[59] Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and NCGA-recommended export approvals, but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, and at the time was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports.[60] For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US.[61] That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection.[62] China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.[citation needed] Syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial, in Kansas on June 23 2017, and was ordered to pay the farmers $217 million.[63] However, Syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict.
Controversies[edit]
Brazil[edit]
On 21 October 2007, a Brazilian peasant organization, the Landless Workers' Movement (Portuguese: Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST), led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the company's seed research farms, in protest against genetically-engineered ("genetically modified") vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate. After the occupation had begun, a team from NF Security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued. A protestor and a security guard were killed, and some protesters and security guards were wounded.[64]
The Brazilian police investigation completed in November 2007 blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of NF Security; the leader of MST was blamed for trespassing. The inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg. The security guard was shot in the head. Eight others were injured, five of them landless.[65]
The Civil Court of Cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on 20 December 2007[66] and on 12 June 2008, the remaining MST members left the Santa Teresa site they had been occupying.[67] On 14 October 2008, Syngenta donated the 123-hectare station to the Agronomy Institute of Paraná (IAPAR) for research into biodiversity, recovery of degraded areas and agriculture production systems, as well as environmental education programs.[68]
Court case
In November 2015, Judge Pedro Ivo Moreiro, of the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel, ruled that Syngenta must pay compensation to the family of Valmir Mota de Oliveira ("Keno"), who was killed in the attack, and to Isabel Nascimento dos Santos who was injured.[69][70] In his sentence the judge stated that "to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality, since […] there is no doubt that, in truth, it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property".[71][72] The version of events put forward by Syngenta was rejected by the Court. In May 2010 Syngenta was condemned by the IV Permanent People's Tribunal for human rights violations in Brazil.[73]
Conflict with Tyrone Hayes[edit]
There has been a long running conflict between Syngenta and University of California at Berkeley biologist Tyrone Hayes.
According to an article in the 10 February 2014, issue of The New Yorker, Syngenta's public-relations team took steps to discredit Hayes, whose research is purported to suggest that the Syngenta-produced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs. The article states that the company paid third-party critics to write articles discrediting Hayes's work, planned to have his wife investigated, and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by Hayes.[42]
During a 21 February interview conducted on Democracy Now, Hayes reiterated the claims.[74] After the interview aired, Syngenta denied targeting Hayes or making any threats, calling those statements "uncorroborated and intentionally damaging" and demanding a retraction and public apology from Hayes and Democracy Now.[75]
In 2010 Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists. Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having "unprofessional and offensive" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.[76][77]
The issue has been described as "one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science”, by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.[78]

Lobbying in the US[edit]
Syngenta's contributions to US federal candidates, parties, and outside groups totaled $267,902 during 2012, ranking it 10th on the list of companies in its sector.[79] Its lobbying expenditures in the US during 2012 were $1,150,000, ranking it 7th in its sector.[80]
Syngenta Foundation[edit]
The objectives and goals of the Syngenta Foundation are "to work with rural communities in the Semi-arid regions of the world and improve their livelihoods."[81] This non-profit organization supports sustainable food security projects in a number of countries.[82] The Syngenta Foundation addressed the World Food Day Symposium in 2005 as an output of the Millennium Ecosystem Report.[83]
Awards and community involvement[edit]
In 2007, Syngenta's Canadian division was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, one of only a handful of agribusiness firms to receive this honour.[84] In October 2008, Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, Inc. was recognized as one of Waterloo Area's Top Employers, as announced in the Waterloo Region Record, Guelph Mercury and Cambridge Times.[85] In 2011, Syngenta was named among the top 10 employers in biotechnology by Science magazine.[86] The 2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index named Syngenta one of the best performing chemical companies worldwide. Syngenta was one of five chemical companies in the World and Europe indices based on economic, social and environmental performance.[87][non-primary source needed]
In 2013, Syngenta announced a set of corporate goals to improve agricultural resource utilization, environmental stewardship, productivity, and education, particularly in poverty-stricken areas.[88]

History[edit]




Syngenta headquarters in Basel


Based in Basel, Switzerland, Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.[4][5] Its roots are considerably older.
Novartis was formed of the 1996 merger of the three Swiss companies:[6] Geigy, which has roots back to 1758;[7] Sandoz Laboratories which was founded in 1876;[citation needed] and Ciba, founded in 1884.[8] Ciba and Geigy had merged in 1971 and had concentrated mainly on crop protection in its agro division,[citation needed] Sandoz more on seeds.[citation needed]




Syngenta works in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire originally owned by ICI.


Zeneca Agrochemicals was part of AstraZeneca, and formerly of Imperial Chemical Industries. ICI was formed in the UK in 1926. Two years later, work began at the Agricultural Research Station at Jealotts Hill near Bracknell.[9]
In 2004, Syngenta Seeds purchased Garst, the North American corn and soybean business of Advanta, as well as Golden Harvest Seeds.[10][11] On 5 December 2004, the European Union ended a six-year moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by Monsanto and its Swiss rival, Syngenta.[12]
In 2005, Syngenta opposed a Swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms.[13] On 28 November 2005, Switzerland enacted a five-year ban on the farming of genetically modified crops, underscoring the problems facing the European Commission and biotech companies like Syngenta, Bayer and Monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety.[14]
As of 2014[update] Syngenta's main competitors are Monsanto Company, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.[15]
In 2014, Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta for a reported $40 billion, but Syngenta rejected the offer.[2][16] Since April 2015 Monsanto and Syngenta had been working with their investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs respectively on a deal. The U.S. Treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion.[17] Syngenta's Board of Directors rejected an even better offer by Monsanto during August 2015, and Monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on 26 August.[18]
According to the Swiss business weekly, Finanz und Wirtschaft, many Syngenta shareholders were enraged, both by the company's refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with Monsanto, and with the subsequent offer withdrawal.[19][20] This resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the Alliance of Critical Syngenta Shareholders, which urged the Board to "evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice".[21]
In a recent interview, Chairman Michel Demaré was asked whether Syngenta could remain independent. He responded, "If you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize, then it would be possible. But in these circumstances, where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price, what they think this company is worth, it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months."[22] He thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold, especially given industry consolidation, which is creating larger competitors.
The failed Monsanto buyout caused Syngenta shares to increase by nearly 40%. In February 2016, ChemChina, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, offered to purchase Syngenta for $43 billion (480 Swiss francs per share), a deal which the company "unanimously recommended to shareholders”.[23] In April 2017, the Federal Trade Commission, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the European Commissioner for Competition approved of the acquisition, allowing the largest foreign takeover in Chinese history to proceed.[24] To secure approval, ChemChina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin, and chlorothalonil.[25][26] As an additional condition for the acquisition, 67 percent of the shareholders of Syngenta had to offer their shares to ChemChina. According to a press release, over 80 percent of shareholders agreed to the takeover by May 4, 2017. Therefore, the transaction is planned to close on June 7, 2017.[27]

Products[edit]
Syngenta has eight primary product lines which it develops, markets and sells worldwide; Its five product lines for pesticides are selective herbicides, non-selective herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and seed care. Three product lines for seed products include corn and soya, other field crops and vegetables.[37][page needed] In 2014, sales from crop protection products accounted for US $11.381 billion, i.e. 75% of total sales.[38][page needed] Field crop seeds include both hybrid seeds and genetically engineered seeds, some of which enter the food chain and become part of genetically modified food. According to Syngenta, in the US their "proprietary triple stack corn seeds expanded to represent around 25 percent of units sold." [39] In 2010, the US EPA approved insecticidal trait stacks including Syngenta's AGRISURE VIPTERA™ gene, which offers resistance to certain corn pests.[39] Syngenta cross-licenses its proprietary genes with Dow AgroSciences and thus is able to include Dow's Herculex I and Herculex RW insect resistance traits in its seeds.[39] It sells a VMAX soybean that is resistant to glyphosate herbicide.[39]
Key Syngenta brands include Actara (Thiamethoxam), Agrisure (corn with Viptera trait), Alto (Cyproconazole), Amistar (azoxystrobin), Avicta, Axial, Bicep II, Bravo, Callisto, Celest, Cruiser (TMX, Thiamethoxam), Dividend, Dual, Durivo, Elatus, Fusilade, Force, Golden Harvest, Gramoxone, Hilleshoeg, Karate, Northrup-King (NK), Proclaim, Revus, Ridomil, Rogers, Score, Seguris, S&G, Tilt, Topik, Touchdown, Vertimec and Vibrance.[37]
Current products[edit]
Atrazine is an herbicide of the triazine class. Atrazine is used to prevent pre- and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.
It is one of the most widely used herbicides in US[40] and Australian agriculture.[41] Atrazine has been banned in the European Union.[42] There has been controversy over atrazine's effects on amphibians,[42] but the EPA has concluded "that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development".[43]
The European Commission decided to suspend use of the company's insecticide Cruiser (thiamethoxam, TMX) on crops pollinated by bees.[44] Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.[45]
Former products[edit]
Syngenta's predecessor, Ciba-Geigy, introduced the insecticide Galecron chlordimeform in 1966, and it was removed from the market in 1988.[46] In 1976, Ciba-Geigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing long-term toxicology studies - particularly studies to determine if long-term exposure could cause cancer - showed that it was causing cancer, and that it has already started to monitor its workers' exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers.[47]:8–9 Ciba-Geigy then applied for, and was granted, permission to market Galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton.[48] However, as further long term monitoring data was obtained, regulators banned chlordimeform in 1988. In a 1995 class action in the US, Ciba-Geigy agreed to cover costs for employee health monitoring and treatment. In 2005, Syngenta reported that employee health monitoring was continuing at the company's Monthey, Switzerland site.[49]
Biofuels[edit]
Like many agriculture companies, Syngenta also works in the biofuel space. In 2011, it announced the corn trait ENOGEN to reduce substantially the consumption of water and energy versus conventional corn.[50] Several ethanol producers plan to process such improved corn.[37] For example, Syngenta has signed a commercial agreement with Three Rivers Energy, LLC of Coshocton, Ohio, US to use grain featuring Enogen trait technology following the 2014 corn harvest.[51]
In 2007, Queensland University in Australia contracted with Syngenta to research different inputs for biofuels as a renewable energy source.[52]
Corporate structure[edit]
Syngenta is led by CEO J. Erik Fyrwald. The other Directors are Vinita Bali, Stefan Borgas, Gunnar Brock, David Lawrence, Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Eveline Saupper, Jacques Vincent, and Jürg Witmer.[37] Syngenta is listed on both the Swiss stock exchange and in New York.[37][page needed] Syngenta employs over 28,000 people in over 90 countries.[citation needed]
Litigation[edit]
In 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Syngenta which had filed a suit against Bayer for patent infringement on a class of neonicotinoid insecticides. The following year Syngenta filed suits against Monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its U.S. biotechnology patents covering genetically modified corn and cotton. In 2004, it again filed a suit against Monsanto, claiming antitrust violations related to the U.S. biotech corn seed market, and Monsanto countersued. Monsanto and Syngenta settled all litigation in 2008.[53]
Syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of Greenville, Illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies. The suit was settled for $105 million in May 2012.[54][55][56] A similar case involving six states has been in federal court since 2010.[57][58]
In the US, Syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding Viptera genetically modified corn. The plaintiffs in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports.[59] Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and NCGA-recommended export approvals, but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, and at the time was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports.[60] For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US.[61] That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection.[62] China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.[citation needed] Syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial, in Kansas on June 23 2017, and was ordered to pay the farmers $217 million.[63] However, Syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict.
Controversies[edit]
Brazil[edit]
On 21 October 2007, a Brazilian peasant organization, the Landless Workers' Movement (Portuguese: Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST), led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the company's seed research farms, in protest against genetically-engineered ("genetically modified") vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate. After the occupation had begun, a team from NF Security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued. A protestor and a security guard were killed, and some protesters and security guards were wounded.[64]
The Brazilian police investigation completed in November 2007 blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of NF Security; the leader of MST was blamed for trespassing. The inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg. The security guard was shot in the head. Eight others were injured, five of them landless.[65]
The Civil Court of Cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on 20 December 2007[66] and on 12 June 2008, the remaining MST members left the Santa Teresa site they had been occupying.[67] On 14 October 2008, Syngenta donated the 123-hectare station to the Agronomy Institute of Paraná (IAPAR) for research into biodiversity, recovery of degraded areas and agriculture production systems, as well as environmental education programs.[68]
Court case
In November 2015, Judge Pedro Ivo Moreiro, of the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel, ruled that Syngenta must pay compensation to the family of Valmir Mota de Oliveira ("Keno"), who was killed in the attack, and to Isabel Nascimento dos Santos who was injured.[69][70] In his sentence the judge stated that "to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality, since […] there is no doubt that, in truth, it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property".[71][72] The version of events put forward by Syngenta was rejected by the Court. In May 2010 Syngenta was condemned by the IV Permanent People's Tribunal for human rights violations in Brazil.[73]
Conflict with Tyrone Hayes[edit]
There has been a long running conflict between Syngenta and University of California at Berkeley biologist Tyrone Hayes.
According to an article in the 10 February 2014, issue of The New Yorker, Syngenta's public-relations team took steps to discredit Hayes, whose research is purported to suggest that the Syngenta-produced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs. The article states that the company paid third-party critics to write articles discrediting Hayes's work, planned to have his wife investigated, and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by Hayes.[42]
During a 21 February interview conducted on Democracy Now, Hayes reiterated the claims.[74] After the interview aired, Syngenta denied targeting Hayes or making any threats, calling those statements "uncorroborated and intentionally damaging" and demanding a retraction and public apology from Hayes and Democracy Now.[75]
In 2010 Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists. Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having "unprofessional and offensive" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.[76][77]
The issue has been described as "one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science”, by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.[78]

Lobbying in the US[edit]
Syngenta's contributions to US federal candidates, parties, and outside groups totaled $267,902 during 2012, ranking it 10th on the list of companies in its sector.[79] Its lobbying expenditures in the US during 2012 were $1,150,000, ranking it 7th in its sector.[80]
Syngenta Foundation[edit]
The objectives and goals of the Syngenta Foundation are "to work with rural communities in the Semi-arid regions of the world and improve their livelihoods."[81] This non-profit organization supports sustainable food security projects in a number of countries.[82] The Syngenta Foundation addressed the World Food Day Symposium in 2005 as an output of the Millennium Ecosystem Report.[83]
Awards and community involvement[edit]
In 2007, Syngenta's Canadian division was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, one of only a handful of agribusiness firms to receive this honour.[84] In October 2008, Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, Inc. was recognized as one of Waterloo Area's Top Employers, as announced in the Waterloo Region Record, Guelph Mercury and Cambridge Times.[85] In 2011, Syngenta was named among the top 10 employers in biotechnology by Science magazine.[86] The 2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index named Syngenta one of the best performing chemical companies worldwide. Syngenta was one of five chemical companies in the World and Europe indices based on economic, social and environmental performance.[87][non-primary source needed]
In 2013, Syngenta announced a set of corporate goals to improve agricultural resource utilization, environmental stewardship, productivity, and education, particularly in poverty-stricken areas.[88]

History[edit]




Syngenta headquarters in Basel


Based in Basel, Switzerland, Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.[4][5] Its roots are considerably older.
Novartis was formed of the 1996 merger of the three Swiss companies:[6] Geigy, which has roots back to 1758;[7] Sandoz Laboratories which was founded in 1876;[citation needed] and Ciba, founded in 1884.[8] Ciba and Geigy had merged in 1971 and had concentrated mainly on crop protection in its agro division,[citation needed] Sandoz more on seeds.[citation needed]




Syngenta works in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire originally owned by ICI.


Zeneca Agrochemicals was part of AstraZeneca, and formerly of Imperial Chemical Industries. ICI was formed in the UK in 1926. Two years later, work began at the Agricultural Research Station at Jealotts Hill near Bracknell.[9]
In 2004, Syngenta Seeds purchased Garst, the North American corn and soybean business of Advanta, as well as Golden Harvest Seeds.[10][11] On 5 December 2004, the European Union ended a six-year moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by Monsanto and its Swiss rival, Syngenta.[12]
In 2005, Syngenta opposed a Swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms.[13] On 28 November 2005, Switzerland enacted a five-year ban on the farming of genetically modified crops, underscoring the problems facing the European Commission and biotech companies like Syngenta, Bayer and Monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety.[14]
As of 2014[update] Syngenta's main competitors are Monsanto Company, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.[15]
In 2014, Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta for a reported $40 billion, but Syngenta rejected the offer.[2][16] Since April 2015 Monsanto and Syngenta had been working with their investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs respectively on a deal. The U.S. Treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion.[17] Syngenta's Board of Directors rejected an even better offer by Monsanto during August 2015, and Monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on 26 August.[18]
According to the Swiss business weekly, Finanz und Wirtschaft, many Syngenta shareholders were enraged, both by the company's refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with Monsanto, and with the subsequent offer withdrawal.[19][20] This resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the Alliance of Critical Syngenta Shareholders, which urged the Board to "evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice".[21]
In a recent interview, Chairman Michel Demaré was asked whether Syngenta could remain independent. He responded, "If you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize, then it would be possible. But in these circumstances, where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price, what they think this company is worth, it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months."[22] He thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold, especially given industry consolidation, which is creating larger competitors.
The failed Monsanto buyout caused Syngenta shares to increase by nearly 40%. In February 2016, ChemChina, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, offered to purchase Syngenta for $43 billion (480 Swiss francs per share), a deal which the company "unanimously recommended to shareholders”.[23] In April 2017, the Federal Trade Commission, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the European Commissioner for Competition approved of the acquisition, allowing the largest foreign takeover in Chinese history to proceed.[24] To secure approval, ChemChina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin, and chlorothalonil.[25][26] As an additional condition for the acquisition, 67 percent of the shareholders of Syngenta had to offer their shares to ChemChina. According to a press release, over 80 percent of shareholders agreed to the takeover by May 4, 2017. Therefore, the transaction is planned to close on June 7, 2017.[27]

Products[edit]
Syngenta has eight primary product lines which it develops, markets and sells worldwide; Its five product lines for pesticides are selective herbicides, non-selective herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and seed care. Three product lines for seed products include corn and soya, other field crops and vegetables.[37][page needed] In 2014, sales from crop protection products accounted for US $11.381 billion, i.e. 75% of total sales.[38][page needed] Field crop seeds include both hybrid seeds and genetically engineered seeds, some of which enter the food chain and become part of genetically modified food. According to Syngenta, in the US their "proprietary triple stack corn seeds expanded to represent around 25 percent of units sold." [39] In 2010, the US EPA approved insecticidal trait stacks including Syngenta's AGRISURE VIPTERA™ gene, which offers resistance to certain corn pests.[39] Syngenta cross-licenses its proprietary genes with Dow AgroSciences and thus is able to include Dow's Herculex I and Herculex RW insect resistance traits in its seeds.[39] It sells a VMAX soybean that is resistant to glyphosate herbicide.[39]
Key Syngenta brands include Actara (Thiamethoxam), Agrisure (corn with Viptera trait), Alto (Cyproconazole), Amistar (azoxystrobin), Avicta, Axial, Bicep II, Bravo, Callisto, Celest, Cruiser (TMX, Thiamethoxam), Dividend, Dual, Durivo, Elatus, Fusilade, Force, Golden Harvest, Gramoxone, Hilleshoeg, Karate, Northrup-King (NK), Proclaim, Revus, Ridomil, Rogers, Score, Seguris, S&G, Tilt, Topik, Touchdown, Vertimec and Vibrance.[37]
Current products[edit]
Atrazine is an herbicide of the triazine class. Atrazine is used to prevent pre- and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.
It is one of the most widely used herbicides in US[40] and Australian agriculture.[41] Atrazine has been banned in the European Union.[42] There has been controversy over atrazine's effects on amphibians,[42] but the EPA has concluded "that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development".[43]
The European Commission decided to suspend use of the company's insecticide Cruiser (thiamethoxam, TMX) on crops pollinated by bees.[44] Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.[45]
Former products[edit]
Syngenta's predecessor, Ciba-Geigy, introduced the insecticide Galecron chlordimeform in 1966, and it was removed from the market in 1988.[46] In 1976, Ciba-Geigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing long-term toxicology studies - particularly studies to determine if long-term exposure could cause cancer - showed that it was causing cancer, and that it has already started to monitor its workers' exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers.[47]:8–9 Ciba-Geigy then applied for, and was granted, permission to market Galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton.[48] However, as further long term monitoring data was obtained, regulators banned chlordimeform in 1988. In a 1995 class action in the US, Ciba-Geigy agreed to cover costs for employee health monitoring and treatment. In 2005, Syngenta reported that employee health monitoring was continuing at the company's Monthey, Switzerland site.[49]
Biofuels[edit]
Like many agriculture companies, Syngenta also works in the biofuel space. In 2011, it announced the corn trait ENOGEN to reduce substantially the consumption of water and energy versus conventional corn.[50] Several ethanol producers plan to process such improved corn.[37] For example, Syngenta has signed a commercial agreement with Three Rivers Energy, LLC of Coshocton, Ohio, US to use grain featuring Enogen trait technology following the 2014 corn harvest.[51]
In 2007, Queensland University in Australia contracted with Syngenta to research different inputs for biofuels as a renewable energy source.[52]
Corporate structure[edit]
Syngenta is led by CEO J. Erik Fyrwald. The other Directors are Vinita Bali, Stefan Borgas, Gunnar Brock, David Lawrence, Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Eveline Saupper, Jacques Vincent, and Jürg Witmer.[37] Syngenta is listed on both the Swiss stock exchange and in New York.[37][page needed] Syngenta employs over 28,000 people in over 90 countries.[citation needed]
Litigation[edit]
In 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Syngenta which had filed a suit against Bayer for patent infringement on a class of neonicotinoid insecticides. The following year Syngenta filed suits against Monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its U.S. biotechnology patents covering genetically modified corn and cotton. In 2004, it again filed a suit against Monsanto, claiming antitrust violations related to the U.S. biotech corn seed market, and Monsanto countersued. Monsanto and Syngenta settled all litigation in 2008.[53]
Syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of Greenville, Illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies. The suit was settled for $105 million in May 2012.[54][55][56] A similar case involving six states has been in federal court since 2010.[57][58]
In the US, Syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding Viptera genetically modified corn. The plaintiffs in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports.[59] Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and NCGA-recommended export approvals, but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, and at the time was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports.[60] For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US.[61] That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection.[62] China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.[citation needed] Syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial, in Kansas on June 23 2017, and was ordered to pay the farmers $217 million.[63] However, Syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict.
Controversies[edit]
Brazil[edit]
On 21 October 2007, a Brazilian peasant organization, the Landless Workers' Movement (Portuguese: Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST), led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the company's seed research farms, in protest against genetically-engineered ("genetically modified") vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate. After the occupation had begun, a team from NF Security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued. A protestor and a security guard were killed, and some protesters and security guards were wounded.[64]
The Brazilian police investigation completed in November 2007 blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of NF Security; the leader of MST was blamed for trespassing. The inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg. The security guard was shot in the head. Eight others were injured, five of them landless.[65]
The Civil Court of Cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on 20 December 2007[66] and on 12 June 2008, the remaining MST members left the Santa Teresa site they had been occupying.[67] On 14 October 2008, Syngenta donated the 123-hectare station to the Agronomy Institute of Paraná (IAPAR) for research into biodiversity, recovery of degraded areas and agriculture production systems, as well as environmental education programs.[68]
Court case
In November 2015, Judge Pedro Ivo Moreiro, of the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel, ruled that Syngenta must pay compensation to the family of Valmir Mota de Oliveira ("Keno"), who was killed in the attack, and to Isabel Nascimento dos Santos who was injured.[69][70] In his sentence the judge stated that "to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality, since […] there is no doubt that, in truth, it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property".[71][72] The version of events put forward by Syngenta was rejected by the Court. In May 2010 Syngenta was condemned by the IV Permanent People's Tribunal for human rights violations in Brazil.[73]
Conflict with Tyrone Hayes[edit]
There has been a long running conflict between Syngenta and University of California at Berkeley biologist Tyrone Hayes.
According to an article in the 10 February 2014, issue of The New Yorker, Syngenta's public-relations team took steps to discredit Hayes, whose research is purported to suggest that the Syngenta-produced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs. The article states that the company paid third-party critics to write articles discrediting Hayes's work, planned to have his wife investigated, and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by Hayes.[42]
During a 21 February interview conducted on Democracy Now, Hayes reiterated the claims.[74] After the interview aired, Syngenta denied targeting Hayes or making any threats, calling those statements "uncorroborated and intentionally damaging" and demanding a retraction and public apology from Hayes and Democracy Now.[75]
In 2010 Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists. Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having "unprofessional and offensive" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.[76][77]
The issue has been described as "one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science”, by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.[78]

Lobbying in the US[edit]
Syngenta's contributions to US federal candidates, parties, and outside groups totaled $267,902 during 2012, ranking it 10th on the list of companies in its sector.[79] Its lobbying expenditures in the US during 2012 were $1,150,000, ranking it 7th in its sector.[80]
Syngenta Foundation[edit]
The objectives and goals of the Syngenta Foundation are "to work with rural communities in the Semi-arid regions of the world and improve their livelihoods."[81] This non-profit organization supports sustainable food security projects in a number of countries.[82] The Syngenta Foundation addressed the World Food Day Symposium in 2005 as an output of the Millennium Ecosystem Report.[83]
Awards and community involvement[edit]
In 2007, Syngenta's Canadian division was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, one of only a handful of agribusiness firms to receive this honour.[84] In October 2008, Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, Inc. was recognized as one of Waterloo Area's Top Employers, as announced in the Waterloo Region Record, Guelph Mercury and Cambridge Times.[85] In 2011, Syngenta was named among the top 10 employers in biotechnology by Science magazine.[86] The 2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index named Syngenta one of the best performing chemical companies worldwide. Syngenta was one of five chemical companies in the World and Europe indices based on economic, social and environmental performance.[87][non-primary source needed]
In 2013, Syngenta announced a set of corporate goals to improve agricultural resource utilization, environmental stewardship, productivity, and education, particularly in poverty-stricken areas.[88]

History[edit]




Syngenta headquarters in Basel


Based in Basel, Switzerland, Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.[4][5] Its roots are considerably older.
Novartis was formed of the 1996 merger of the three Swiss companies:[6] Geigy, which has roots back to 1758;[7] Sandoz Laboratories which was founded in 1876;[citation needed] and Ciba, founded in 1884.[8] Ciba and Geigy had merged in 1971 and had concentrated mainly on crop protection in its agro division,[citation needed] Sandoz more on seeds.[citation needed]




Syngenta works in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire originally owned by ICI.


Zeneca Agrochemicals was part of AstraZeneca, and formerly of Imperial Chemical Industries. ICI was formed in the UK in 1926. Two years later, work began at the Agricultural Research Station at Jealotts Hill near Bracknell.[9]
In 2004, Syngenta Seeds purchased Garst, the North American corn and soybean business of Advanta, as well as Golden Harvest Seeds.[10][11] On 5 December 2004, the European Union ended a six-year moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by Monsanto and its Swiss rival, Syngenta.[12]
In 2005, Syngenta opposed a Swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms.[13] On 28 November 2005, Switzerland enacted a five-year ban on the farming of genetically modified crops, underscoring the problems facing the European Commission and biotech companies like Syngenta, Bayer and Monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety.[14]
As of 2014[update] Syngenta's main competitors are Monsanto Company, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.[15]
In 2014, Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta for a reported $40 billion, but Syngenta rejected the offer.[2][16] Since April 2015 Monsanto and Syngenta had been working with their investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs respectively on a deal. The U.S. Treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion.[17] Syngenta's Board of Directors rejected an even better offer by Monsanto during August 2015, and Monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on 26 August.[18]
According to the Swiss business weekly, Finanz und Wirtschaft, many Syngenta shareholders were enraged, both by the company's refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with Monsanto, and with the subsequent offer withdrawal.[19][20] This resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the Alliance of Critical Syngenta Shareholders, which urged the Board to "evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice".[21]
In a recent interview, Chairman Michel Demaré was asked whether Syngenta could remain independent. He responded, "If you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize, then it would be possible. But in these circumstances, where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price, what they think this company is worth, it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months."[22] He thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold, especially given industry consolidation, which is creating larger competitors.
The failed Monsanto buyout caused Syngenta shares to increase by nearly 40%. In February 2016, ChemChina, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, offered to purchase Syngenta for $43 billion (480 Swiss francs per share), a deal which the company "unanimously recommended to shareholders”.[23] In April 2017, the Federal Trade Commission, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the European Commissioner for Competition approved of the acquisition, allowing the largest foreign takeover in Chinese history to proceed.[24] To secure approval, ChemChina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin, and chlorothalonil.[25][26] As an additional condition for the acquisition, 67 percent of the shareholders of Syngenta had to offer their shares to ChemChina. According to a press release, over 80 percent of shareholders agreed to the takeover by May 4, 2017. Therefore, the transaction is planned to close on June 7, 2017.[27]

Products[edit]
Syngenta has eight primary product lines which it develops, markets and sells worldwide; Its five product lines for pesticides are selective herbicides, non-selective herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and seed care. Three product lines for seed products include corn and soya, other field crops and vegetables.[37][page needed] In 2014, sales from crop protection products accounted for US $11.381 billion, i.e. 75% of total sales.[38][page needed] Field crop seeds include both hybrid seeds and genetically engineered seeds, some of which enter the food chain and become part of genetically modified food. According to Syngenta, in the US their "proprietary triple stack corn seeds expanded to represent around 25 percent of units sold." [39] In 2010, the US EPA approved insecticidal trait stacks including Syngenta's AGRISURE VIPTERA™ gene, which offers resistance to certain corn pests.[39] Syngenta cross-licenses its proprietary genes with Dow AgroSciences and thus is able to include Dow's Herculex I and Herculex RW insect resistance traits in its seeds.[39] It sells a VMAX soybean that is resistant to glyphosate herbicide.[39]
Key Syngenta brands include Actara (Thiamethoxam), Agrisure (corn with Viptera trait), Alto (Cyproconazole), Amistar (azoxystrobin), Avicta, Axial, Bicep II, Bravo, Callisto, Celest, Cruiser (TMX, Thiamethoxam), Dividend, Dual, Durivo, Elatus, Fusilade, Force, Golden Harvest, Gramoxone, Hilleshoeg, Karate, Northrup-King (NK), Proclaim, Revus, Ridomil, Rogers, Score, Seguris, S&G, Tilt, Topik, Touchdown, Vertimec and Vibrance.[37]
Current products[edit]
Atrazine is an herbicide of the triazine class. Atrazine is used to prevent pre- and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.
It is one of the most widely used herbicides in US[40] and Australian agriculture.[41] Atrazine has been banned in the European Union.[42] There has been controversy over atrazine's effects on amphibians,[42] but the EPA has concluded "that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development".[43]
The European Commission decided to suspend use of the company's insecticide Cruiser (thiamethoxam, TMX) on crops pollinated by bees.[44] Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.[45]
Former products[edit]
Syngenta's predecessor, Ciba-Geigy, introduced the insecticide Galecron chlordimeform in 1966, and it was removed from the market in 1988.[46] In 1976, Ciba-Geigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing long-term toxicology studies - particularly studies to determine if long-term exposure could cause cancer - showed that it was causing cancer, and that it has already started to monitor its workers' exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers.[47]:8–9 Ciba-Geigy then applied for, and was granted, permission to market Galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton.[48] However, as further long term monitoring data was obtained, regulators banned chlordimeform in 1988. In a 1995 class action in the US, Ciba-Geigy agreed to cover costs for employee health monitoring and treatment. In 2005, Syngenta reported that employee health monitoring was continuing at the company's Monthey, Switzerland site.[49]
Biofuels[edit]
Like many agriculture companies, Syngenta also works in the biofuel space. In 2011, it announced the corn trait ENOGEN to reduce substantially the consumption of water and energy versus conventional corn.[50] Several ethanol producers plan to process such improved corn.[37] For example, Syngenta has signed a commercial agreement with Three Rivers Energy, LLC of Coshocton, Ohio, US to use grain featuring Enogen trait technology following the 2014 corn harvest.[51]
In 2007, Queensland University in Australia contracted with Syngenta to research different inputs for biofuels as a renewable energy source.[52]
Corporate structure[edit]
Syngenta is led by CEO J. Erik Fyrwald. The other Directors are Vinita Bali, Stefan Borgas, Gunnar Brock, David Lawrence, Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Eveline Saupper, Jacques Vincent, and Jürg Witmer.[37] Syngenta is listed on both the Swiss stock exchange and in New York.[37][page needed] Syngenta employs over 28,000 people in over 90 countries.[citation needed]
Litigation[edit]
In 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Syngenta which had filed a suit against Bayer for patent infringement on a class of neonicotinoid insecticides. The following year Syngenta filed suits against Monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its U.S. biotechnology patents covering genetically modified corn and cotton. In 2004, it again filed a suit against Monsanto, claiming antitrust violations related to the U.S. biotech corn seed market, and Monsanto countersued. Monsanto and Syngenta settled all litigation in 2008.[53]
Syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of Greenville, Illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies. The suit was settled for $105 million in May 2012.[54][55][56] A similar case involving six states has been in federal court since 2010.[57][58]
In the US, Syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding Viptera genetically modified corn. The plaintiffs in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports.[59] Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and NCGA-recommended export approvals, but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, and at the time was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports.[60] For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US.[61] That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection.[62] China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.[citation needed] Syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial, in Kansas on June 23 2017, and was ordered to pay the farmers $217 million.[63] However, Syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict.
Controversies[edit]
Brazil[edit]
On 21 October 2007, a Brazilian peasant organization, the Landless Workers' Movement (Portuguese: Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST), led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the company's seed research farms, in protest against genetically-engineered ("genetically modified") vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate. After the occupation had begun, a team from NF Security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued. A protestor and a security guard were killed, and some protesters and security guards were wounded.[64]
The Brazilian police investigation completed in November 2007 blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of NF Security; the leader of MST was blamed for trespassing. The inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg. The security guard was shot in the head. Eight others were injured, five of them landless.[65]
The Civil Court of Cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on 20 December 2007[66] and on 12 June 2008, the remaining MST members left the Santa Teresa site they had been occupying.[67] On 14 October 2008, Syngenta donated the 123-hectare station to the Agronomy Institute of Paraná (IAPAR) for research into biodiversity, recovery of degraded areas and agriculture production systems, as well as environmental education programs.[68]
Court case
In November 2015, Judge Pedro Ivo Moreiro, of the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel, ruled that Syngenta must pay compensation to the family of Valmir Mota de Oliveira ("Keno"), who was killed in the attack, and to Isabel Nascimento dos Santos who was injured.[69][70] In his sentence the judge stated that "to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality, since […] there is no doubt that, in truth, it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property".[71][72] The version of events put forward by Syngenta was rejected by the Court. In May 2010 Syngenta was condemned by the IV Permanent People's Tribunal for human rights violations in Brazil.[73]
Conflict with Tyrone Hayes[edit]
There has been a long running conflict between Syngenta and University of California at Berkeley biologist Tyrone Hayes.
According to an article in the 10 February 2014, issue of The New Yorker, Syngenta's public-relations team took steps to discredit Hayes, whose research is purported to suggest that the Syngenta-produced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs. The article states that the company paid third-party critics to write articles discrediting Hayes's work, planned to have his wife investigated, and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by Hayes.[42]
During a 21 February interview conducted on Democracy Now, Hayes reiterated the claims.[74] After the interview aired, Syngenta denied targeting Hayes or making any threats, calling those statements "uncorroborated and intentionally damaging" and demanding a retraction and public apology from Hayes and Democracy Now.[75]
In 2010 Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists. Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having "unprofessional and offensive" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.[76][77]
The issue has been described as "one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science”, by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.[78]

Lobbying in the US[edit]
Syngenta's contributions to US federal candidates, parties, and outside groups totaled $267,902 during 2012, ranking it 10th on the list of companies in its sector.[79] Its lobbying expenditures in the US during 2012 were $1,150,000, ranking it 7th in its sector.[80]
Syngenta Foundation[edit]
The objectives and goals of the Syngenta Foundation are "to work with rural communities in the Semi-arid regions of the world and improve their livelihoods."[81] This non-profit organization supports sustainable food security projects in a number of countries.[82] The Syngenta Foundation addressed the World Food Day Symposium in 2005 as an output of the Millennium Ecosystem Report.[83]
Awards and community involvement[edit]
In 2007, Syngenta's Canadian division was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, one of only a handful of agribusiness firms to receive this honour.[84] In October 2008, Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, Inc. was recognized as one of Waterloo Area's Top Employers, as announced in the Waterloo Region Record, Guelph Mercury and Cambridge Times.[85] In 2011, Syngenta was named among the top 10 employers in biotechnology by Science magazine.[86] The 2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index named Syngenta one of the best performing chemical companies worldwide. Syngenta was one of five chemical companies in the World and Europe indices based on economic, social and environmental performance.[87][non-primary source needed]
In 2013, Syngenta announced a set of corporate goals to improve agricultural resource utilization, environmental stewardship, productivity, and education, particularly in poverty-stricken areas.[88]

History[edit]




Syngenta headquarters in Basel


Based in Basel, Switzerland, Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.[4][5] Its roots are considerably older.
Novartis was formed of the 1996 merger of the three Swiss companies:[6] Geigy, which has roots back to 1758;[7] Sandoz Laboratories which was founded in 1876;[citation needed] and Ciba, founded in 1884.[8] Ciba and Geigy had merged in 1971 and had concentrated mainly on crop protection in its agro division,[citation needed] Sandoz more on seeds.[citation needed]




Syngenta works in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire originally owned by ICI.


Zeneca Agrochemicals was part of AstraZeneca, and formerly of Imperial Chemical Industries. ICI was formed in the UK in 1926. Two years later, work began at the Agricultural Research Station at Jealotts Hill near Bracknell.[9]
In 2004, Syngenta Seeds purchased Garst, the North American corn and soybean business of Advanta, as well as Golden Harvest Seeds.[10][11] On 5 December 2004, the European Union ended a six-year moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by Monsanto and its Swiss rival, Syngenta.[12]
In 2005, Syngenta opposed a Swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms.[13] On 28 November 2005, Switzerland enacted a five-year ban on the farming of genetically modified crops, underscoring the problems facing the European Commission and biotech companies like Syngenta, Bayer and Monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety.[14]
As of 2014[update] Syngenta's main competitors are Monsanto Company, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.[15]
In 2014, Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta for a reported $40 billion, but Syngenta rejected the offer.[2][16] Since April 2015 Monsanto and Syngenta had been working with their investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs respectively on a deal. The U.S. Treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion.[17] Syngenta's Board of Directors rejected an even better offer by Monsanto during August 2015, and Monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on 26 August.[18]
According to the Swiss business weekly, Finanz und Wirtschaft, many Syngenta shareholders were enraged, both by the company's refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with Monsanto, and with the subsequent offer withdrawal.[19][20] This resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the Alliance of Critical Syngenta Shareholders, which urged the Board to "evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice".[21]
In a recent interview, Chairman Michel Demaré was asked whether Syngenta could remain independent. He responded, "If you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize, then it would be possible. But in these circumstances, where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price, what they think this company is worth, it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months."[22] He thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold, especially given industry consolidation, which is creating larger competitors.
The failed Monsanto buyout caused Syngenta shares to increase by nearly 40%. In February 2016, ChemChina, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, offered to purchase Syngenta for $43 billion (480 Swiss francs per share), a deal which the company "unanimously recommended to shareholders”.[23] In April 2017, the Federal Trade Commission, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the European Commissioner for Competition approved of the acquisition, allowing the largest foreign takeover in Chinese history to proceed.[24] To secure approval, ChemChina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin, and chlorothalonil.[25][26] As an additional condition for the acquisition, 67 percent of the shareholders of Syngenta had to offer their shares to ChemChina. According to a press release, over 80 percent of shareholders agreed to the takeover by May 4, 2017. Therefore, the transaction is planned to close on June 7, 2017.[27]

Products[edit]
Syngenta has eight primary product lines which it develops, markets and sells worldwide; Its five product lines for pesticides are selective herbicides, non-selective herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and seed care. Three product lines for seed products include corn and soya, other field crops and vegetables.[37][page needed] In 2014, sales from crop protection products accounted for US $11.381 billion, i.e. 75% of total sales.[38][page needed] Field crop seeds include both hybrid seeds and genetically engineered seeds, some of which enter the food chain and become part of genetically modified food. According to Syngenta, in the US their "proprietary triple stack corn seeds expanded to represent around 25 percent of units sold." [39] In 2010, the US EPA approved insecticidal trait stacks including Syngenta's AGRISURE VIPTERA™ gene, which offers resistance to certain corn pests.[39] Syngenta cross-licenses its proprietary genes with Dow AgroSciences and thus is able to include Dow's Herculex I and Herculex RW insect resistance traits in its seeds.[39] It sells a VMAX soybean that is resistant to glyphosate herbicide.[39]
Key Syngenta brands include Actara (Thiamethoxam), Agrisure (corn with Viptera trait), Alto (Cyproconazole), Amistar (azoxystrobin), Avicta, Axial, Bicep II, Bravo, Callisto, Celest, Cruiser (TMX, Thiamethoxam), Dividend, Dual, Durivo, Elatus, Fusilade, Force, Golden Harvest, Gramoxone, Hilleshoeg, Karate, Northrup-King (NK), Proclaim, Revus, Ridomil, Rogers, Score, Seguris, S&G, Tilt, Topik, Touchdown, Vertimec and Vibrance.[37]
Current products[edit]
Atrazine is an herbicide of the triazine class. Atrazine is used to prevent pre- and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.
It is one of the most widely used herbicides in US[40] and Australian agriculture.[41] Atrazine has been banned in the European Union.[42] There has been controversy over atrazine's effects on amphibians,[42] but the EPA has concluded "that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development".[43]
The European Commission decided to suspend use of the company's insecticide Cruiser (thiamethoxam, TMX) on crops pollinated by bees.[44] Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.[45]
Former products[edit]
Syngenta's predecessor, Ciba-Geigy, introduced the insecticide Galecron chlordimeform in 1966, and it was removed from the market in 1988.[46] In 1976, Ciba-Geigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing long-term toxicology studies - particularly studies to determine if long-term exposure could cause cancer - showed that it was causing cancer, and that it has already started to monitor its workers' exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers.[47]:8–9 Ciba-Geigy then applied for, and was granted, permission to market Galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton.[48] However, as further long term monitoring data was obtained, regulators banned chlordimeform in 1988. In a 1995 class action in the US, Ciba-Geigy agreed to cover costs for employee health monitoring and treatment. In 2005, Syngenta reported that employee health monitoring was continuing at the company's Monthey, Switzerland site.[49]
Biofuels[edit]
Like many agriculture companies, Syngenta also works in the biofuel space. In 2011, it announced the corn trait ENOGEN to reduce substantially the consumption of water and energy versus conventional corn.[50] Several ethanol producers plan to process such improved corn.[37] For example, Syngenta has signed a commercial agreement with Three Rivers Energy, LLC of Coshocton, Ohio, US to use grain featuring Enogen trait technology following the 2014 corn harvest.[51]
In 2007, Queensland University in Australia contracted with Syngenta to research different inputs for biofuels as a renewable energy source.[52]
Corporate structure[edit]
Syngenta is led by CEO J. Erik Fyrwald. The other Directors are Vinita Bali, Stefan Borgas, Gunnar Brock, David Lawrence, Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Eveline Saupper, Jacques Vincent, and Jürg Witmer.[37] Syngenta is listed on both the Swiss stock exchange and in New York.[37][page needed] Syngenta employs over 28,000 people in over 90 countries.[citation needed]
Litigation[edit]
In 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Syngenta which had filed a suit against Bayer for patent infringement on a class of neonicotinoid insecticides. The following year Syngenta filed suits against Monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its U.S. biotechnology patents covering genetically modified corn and cotton. In 2004, it again filed a suit against Monsanto, claiming antitrust violations related to the U.S. biotech corn seed market, and Monsanto countersued. Monsanto and Syngenta settled all litigation in 2008.[53]
Syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of Greenville, Illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies. The suit was settled for $105 million in May 2012.[54][55][56] A similar case involving six states has been in federal court since 2010.[57][58]
In the US, Syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding Viptera genetically modified corn. The plaintiffs in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports.[59] Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and NCGA-recommended export approvals, but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, and at the time was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports.[60] For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US.[61] That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection.[62] China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.[citation needed] Syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial, in Kansas on June 23 2017, and was ordered to pay the farmers $217 million.[63] However, Syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict.
Controversies[edit]
Brazil[edit]
On 21 October 2007, a Brazilian peasant organization, the Landless Workers' Movement (Portuguese: Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST), led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the company's seed research farms, in protest against genetically-engineered ("genetically modified") vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate. After the occupation had begun, a team from NF Security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued. A protestor and a security guard were killed, and some protesters and security guards were wounded.[64]
The Brazilian police investigation completed in November 2007 blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of NF Security; the leader of MST was blamed for trespassing. The inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg. The security guard was shot in the head. Eight others were injured, five of them landless.[65]
The Civil Court of Cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on 20 December 2007[66] and on 12 June 2008, the remaining MST members left the Santa Teresa site they had been occupying.[67] On 14 October 2008, Syngenta donated the 123-hectare station to the Agronomy Institute of Paraná (IAPAR) for research into biodiversity, recovery of degraded areas and agriculture production systems, as well as environmental education programs.[68]
Court case
In November 2015, Judge Pedro Ivo Moreiro, of the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel, ruled that Syngenta must pay compensation to the family of Valmir Mota de Oliveira ("Keno"), who was killed in the attack, and to Isabel Nascimento dos Santos who was injured.[69][70] In his sentence the judge stated that "to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality, since […] there is no doubt that, in truth, it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property".[71][72] The version of events put forward by Syngenta was rejected by the Court. In May 2010 Syngenta was condemned by the IV Permanent People's Tribunal for human rights violations in Brazil.[73]
Conflict with Tyrone Hayes[edit]
There has been a long running conflict between Syngenta and University of California at Berkeley biologist Tyrone Hayes.
According to an article in the 10 February 2014, issue of The New Yorker, Syngenta's public-relations team took steps to discredit Hayes, whose research is purported to suggest that the Syngenta-produced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs. The article states that the company paid third-party critics to write articles discrediting Hayes's work, planned to have his wife investigated, and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by Hayes.[42]
During a 21 February interview conducted on Democracy Now, Hayes reiterated the claims.[74] After the interview aired, Syngenta denied targeting Hayes or making any threats, calling those statements "uncorroborated and intentionally damaging" and demanding a retraction and public apology from Hayes and Democracy Now.[75]
In 2010 Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists. Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having "unprofessional and offensive" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.[76][77]
The issue has been described as "one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science”, by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.[78]

Lobbying in the US[edit]
Syngenta's contributions to US federal candidates, parties, and outside groups totaled $267,902 during 2012, ranking it 10th on the list of companies in its sector.[79] Its lobbying expenditures in the US during 2012 were $1,150,000, ranking it 7th in its sector.[80]
Syngenta Foundation[edit]
The objectives and goals of the Syngenta Foundation are "to work with rural communities in the Semi-arid regions of the world and improve their livelihoods."[81] This non-profit organization supports sustainable food security projects in a number of countries.[82] The Syngenta Foundation addressed the World Food Day Symposium in 2005 as an output of the Millennium Ecosystem Report.[83]
Awards and community involvement[edit]
In 2007, Syngenta's Canadian division was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, one of only a handful of agribusiness firms to receive this honour.[84] In October 2008, Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, Inc. was recognized as one of Waterloo Area's Top Employers, as announced in the Waterloo Region Record, Guelph Mercury and Cambridge Times.[85] In 2011, Syngenta was named among the top 10 employers in biotechnology by Science magazine.[86] The 2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index named Syngenta one of the best performing chemical companies worldwide. Syngenta was one of five chemical companies in the World and Europe indices based on economic, social and environmental performance.[87][non-primary source needed]
In 2013, Syngenta announced a set of corporate goals to improve agricultural resource utilization, environmental stewardship, productivity, and education, particularly in poverty-stricken areas.[88]

History[edit]




Syngenta headquarters in Basel


Based in Basel, Switzerland, Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.[4][5] Its roots are considerably older.
Novartis was formed of the 1996 merger of the three Swiss companies:[6] Geigy, which has roots back to 1758;[7] Sandoz Laboratories which was founded in 1876;[citation needed] and Ciba, founded in 1884.[8] Ciba and Geigy had merged in 1971 and had concentrated mainly on crop protection in its agro division,[citation needed] Sandoz more on seeds.[citation needed]




Syngenta works in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire originally owned by ICI.


Zeneca Agrochemicals was part of AstraZeneca, and formerly of Imperial Chemical Industries. ICI was formed in the UK in 1926. Two years later, work began at the Agricultural Research Station at Jealotts Hill near Bracknell.[9]
In 2004, Syngenta Seeds purchased Garst, the North American corn and soybean business of Advanta, as well as Golden Harvest Seeds.[10][11] On 5 December 2004, the European Union ended a six-year moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by Monsanto and its Swiss rival, Syngenta.[12]
In 2005, Syngenta opposed a Swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms.[13] On 28 November 2005, Switzerland enacted a five-year ban on the farming of genetically modified crops, underscoring the problems facing the European Commission and biotech companies like Syngenta, Bayer and Monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety.[14]
As of 2014[update] Syngenta's main competitors are Monsanto Company, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.[15]
In 2014, Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta for a reported $40 billion, but Syngenta rejected the offer.[2][16] Since April 2015 Monsanto and Syngenta had been working with their investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs respectively on a deal. The U.S. Treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion.[17] Syngenta's Board of Directors rejected an even better offer by Monsanto during August 2015, and Monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on 26 August.[18]
According to the Swiss business weekly, Finanz und Wirtschaft, many Syngenta shareholders were enraged, both by the company's refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with Monsanto, and with the subsequent offer withdrawal.[19][20] This resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the Alliance of Critical Syngenta Shareholders, which urged the Board to "evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice".[21]
In a recent interview, Chairman Michel Demaré was asked whether Syngenta could remain independent. He responded, "If you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize, then it would be possible. But in these circumstances, where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price, what they think this company is worth, it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months."[22] He thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold, especially given industry consolidation, which is creating larger competitors.
The failed Monsanto buyout caused Syngenta shares to increase by nearly 40%. In February 2016, ChemChina, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, offered to purchase Syngenta for $43 billion (480 Swiss francs per share), a deal which the company "unanimously recommended to shareholders”.[23] In April 2017, the Federal Trade Commission, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the European Commissioner for Competition approved of the acquisition, allowing the largest foreign takeover in Chinese history to proceed.[24] To secure approval, ChemChina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin, and chlorothalonil.[25][26] As an additional condition for the acquisition, 67 percent of the shareholders of Syngenta had to offer their shares to ChemChina. According to a press release, over 80 percent of shareholders agreed to the takeover by May 4, 2017. Therefore, the transaction is planned to close on June 7, 2017.[27]

Products[edit]
Syngenta has eight primary product lines which it develops, markets and sells worldwide; Its five product lines for pesticides are selective herbicides, non-selective herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and seed care. Three product lines for seed products include corn and soya, other field crops and vegetables.[37][page needed] In 2014, sales from crop protection products accounted for US $11.381 billion, i.e. 75% of total sales.[38][page needed] Field crop seeds include both hybrid seeds and genetically engineered seeds, some of which enter the food chain and become part of genetically modified food. According to Syngenta, in the US their "proprietary triple stack corn seeds expanded to represent around 25 percent of units sold." [39] In 2010, the US EPA approved insecticidal trait stacks including Syngenta's AGRISURE VIPTERA™ gene, which offers resistance to certain corn pests.[39] Syngenta cross-licenses its proprietary genes with Dow AgroSciences and thus is able to include Dow's Herculex I and Herculex RW insect resistance traits in its seeds.[39] It sells a VMAX soybean that is resistant to glyphosate herbicide.[39]
Key Syngenta brands include Actara (Thiamethoxam), Agrisure (corn with Viptera trait), Alto (Cyproconazole), Amistar (azoxystrobin), Avicta, Axial, Bicep II, Bravo, Callisto, Celest, Cruiser (TMX, Thiamethoxam), Dividend, Dual, Durivo, Elatus, Fusilade, Force, Golden Harvest, Gramoxone, Hilleshoeg, Karate, Northrup-King (NK), Proclaim, Revus, Ridomil, Rogers, Score, Seguris, S&G, Tilt, Topik, Touchdown, Vertimec and Vibrance.[37]
Current products[edit]
Atrazine is an herbicide of the triazine class. Atrazine is used to prevent pre- and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.
It is one of the most widely used herbicides in US[40] and Australian agriculture.[41] Atrazine has been banned in the European Union.[42] There has been controversy over atrazine's effects on amphibians,[42] but the EPA has concluded "that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development".[43]
The European Commission decided to suspend use of the company's insecticide Cruiser (thiamethoxam, TMX) on crops pollinated by bees.[44] Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.[45]
Former products[edit]
Syngenta's predecessor, Ciba-Geigy, introduced the insecticide Galecron chlordimeform in 1966, and it was removed from the market in 1988.[46] In 1976, Ciba-Geigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing long-term toxicology studies - particularly studies to determine if long-term exposure could cause cancer - showed that it was causing cancer, and that it has already started to monitor its workers' exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers.[47]:8–9 Ciba-Geigy then applied for, and was granted, permission to market Galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton.[48] However, as further long term monitoring data was obtained, regulators banned chlordimeform in 1988. In a 1995 class action in the US, Ciba-Geigy agreed to cover costs for employee health monitoring and treatment. In 2005, Syngenta reported that employee health monitoring was continuing at the company's Monthey, Switzerland site.[49]
Biofuels[edit]
Like many agriculture companies, Syngenta also works in the biofuel space. In 2011, it announced the corn trait ENOGEN to reduce substantially the consumption of water and energy versus conventional corn.[50] Several ethanol producers plan to process such improved corn.[37] For example, Syngenta has signed a commercial agreement with Three Rivers Energy, LLC of Coshocton, Ohio, US to use grain featuring Enogen trait technology following the 2014 corn harvest.[51]
In 2007, Queensland University in Australia contracted with Syngenta to research different inputs for biofuels as a renewable energy source.[52]
Corporate structure[edit]
Syngenta is led by CEO J. Erik Fyrwald. The other Directors are Vinita Bali, Stefan Borgas, Gunnar Brock, David Lawrence, Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Eveline Saupper, Jacques Vincent, and Jürg Witmer.[37] Syngenta is listed on both the Swiss stock exchange and in New York.[37][page needed] Syngenta employs over 28,000 people in over 90 countries.[citation needed]
Litigation[edit]
In 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Syngenta which had filed a suit against Bayer for patent infringement on a class of neonicotinoid insecticides. The following year Syngenta filed suits against Monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its U.S. biotechnology patents covering genetically modified corn and cotton. In 2004, it again filed a suit against Monsanto, claiming antitrust violations related to the U.S. biotech corn seed market, and Monsanto countersued. Monsanto and Syngenta settled all litigation in 2008.[53]
Syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of Greenville, Illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies. The suit was settled for $105 million in May 2012.[54][55][56] A similar case involving six states has been in federal court since 2010.[57][58]
In the US, Syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding Viptera genetically modified corn. The plaintiffs in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports.[59] Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and NCGA-recommended export approvals, but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, and at the time was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports.[60] For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US.[61] That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection.[62] China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.[citation needed] Syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial, in Kansas on June 23 2017, and was ordered to pay the farmers $217 million.[63] However, Syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict.
Controversies[edit]
Brazil[edit]
On 21 October 2007, a Brazilian peasant organization, the Landless Workers' Movement (Portuguese: Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST), led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the company's seed research farms, in protest against genetically-engineered ("genetically modified") vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate. After the occupation had begun, a team from NF Security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued. A protestor and a security guard were killed, and some protesters and security guards were wounded.[64]
The Brazilian police investigation completed in November 2007 blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of NF Security; the leader of MST was blamed for trespassing. The inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg. The security guard was shot in the head. Eight others were injured, five of them landless.[65]
The Civil Court of Cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on 20 December 2007[66] and on 12 June 2008, the remaining MST members left the Santa Teresa site they had been occupying.[67] On 14 October 2008, Syngenta donated the 123-hectare station to the Agronomy Institute of Paraná (IAPAR) for research into biodiversity, recovery of degraded areas and agriculture production systems, as well as environmental education programs.[68]
Court case
In November 2015, Judge Pedro Ivo Moreiro, of the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel, ruled that Syngenta must pay compensation to the family of Valmir Mota de Oliveira ("Keno"), who was killed in the attack, and to Isabel Nascimento dos Santos who was injured.[69][70] In his sentence the judge stated that "to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality, since […] there is no doubt that, in truth, it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property".[71][72] The version of events put forward by Syngenta was rejected by the Court. In May 2010 Syngenta was condemned by the IV Permanent People's Tribunal for human rights violations in Brazil.[73]
Conflict with Tyrone Hayes[edit]
There has been a long running conflict between Syngenta and University of California at Berkeley biologist Tyrone Hayes.
According to an article in the 10 February 2014, issue of The New Yorker, Syngenta's public-relations team took steps to discredit Hayes, whose research is purported to suggest that the Syngenta-produced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs. The article states that the company paid third-party critics to write articles discrediting Hayes's work, planned to have his wife investigated, and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by Hayes.[42]
During a 21 February interview conducted on Democracy Now, Hayes reiterated the claims.[74] After the interview aired, Syngenta denied targeting Hayes or making any threats, calling those statements "uncorroborated and intentionally damaging" and demanding a retraction and public apology from Hayes and Democracy Now.[75]
In 2010 Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists. Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having "unprofessional and offensive" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.[76][77]
The issue has been described as "one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science”, by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.[78]

Lobbying in the US[edit]
Syngenta's contributions to US federal candidates, parties, and outside groups totaled $267,902 during 2012, ranking it 10th on the list of companies in its sector.[79] Its lobbying expenditures in the US during 2012 were $1,150,000, ranking it 7th in its sector.[80]
Syngenta Foundation[edit]
The objectives and goals of the Syngenta Foundation are "to work with rural communities in the Semi-arid regions of the world and improve their livelihoods."[81] This non-profit organization supports sustainable food security projects in a number of countries.[82] The Syngenta Foundation addressed the World Food Day Symposium in 2005 as an output of the Millennium Ecosystem Report.[83]
Awards and community involvement[edit]
In 2007, Syngenta's Canadian division was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, one of only a handful of agribusiness firms to receive this honour.[84] In October 2008, Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, Inc. was recognized as one of Waterloo Area's Top Employers, as announced in the Waterloo Region Record, Guelph Mercury and Cambridge Times.[85] In 2011, Syngenta was named among the top 10 employers in biotechnology by Science magazine.[86] The 2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index named Syngenta one of the best performing chemical companies worldwide. Syngenta was one of five chemical companies in the World and Europe indices based on economic, social and environmental performance.[87][non-primary source needed]
In 2013, Syngenta announced a set of corporate goals to improve agricultural resource utilization, environmental stewardship, productivity, and education, particularly in poverty-stricken areas.[88]

SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWSYT » Topics » ProductionThis excerpt taken from the SYT 20-F filed Mar 1, 2006.
Production 

Plant Science manufactures and sells one product, QUANTUM® Phytase, a microbial produced animal feed supplement, which is
commercially available in Mexico and Brazil.  There are two stages to the microbial phytase manufacturing process, production of the active enzyme by fermentation and formulation.  Both processes are currently carried out under toll manufacture
arrangements. 
Products in Development
Plant Science generates some income through product sales of QUANTUM® Phytase in Mexico, with registration in the United States
awaited, and through outlicensing of technology.  Syngenta expects future income to arise from new product development, licensing and other arrangements.  To drive near term success, Plant Science has put emphasis on the commercialization of
close-to-market projects that are aligned with the strengths of the Syngenta Crop Protection and Seeds businesses.
30









Work on pharmaceutical compounds progressed in 2005 to the stage of clinical trials; however, in view of the extended time lines and associated costs of full commercialization, Syngenta decided at the end of 2005 to
seek third parties to take these projects through development to commercial launch. 

Some of the Plant Science projects described here are within five years of commercial availability.

Research and Development
Syngenta maintains its primary center for biotechnology research at Syngenta Biotechnology, Inc. (SBI) in Research Triangle Park in the United States.  This site is dedicated to research in agricultural genomics and
biotechnology and in June 2004 Syngenta announced that it would transfer biotechnology research work from its Jealotts Hill facility and concentrate biotech research at SBI.  In-house work is complemented and strengthened through numerous alliances
and collaborations.  In February 2003, Syngenta and Diversa Corporation formed a broad collaboration to establish a shared biotechnology research platform for new plant science applications and enzyme discovery, as well as for selected antibody
generation and other biopharma product development. Pursuant to the collaboration, in February 2003, Diversa acquired certain technology rights from Syngenta for pharmaceutical applications and in exchange, Syngenta received an increased equity
stake in Diversa. 

In 2004, Syngenta and Diversa concluded a new
agreement that folded their earlier animal feed collaboration that commenced
in 1999 into the broader research agreement concluded in 2003. In addition to
Diversa, examples of other Syngenta external alliances include a licensing agreement
with Delta and Pine Land Company of the USA for insect control in cotton 


Delta and Pine Land Company of the USA: licensing arrangement for insect control in cotton.

SemBioSys: provided Syngenta with access to oilbody technology that is useful across a number of future products in biopharma.


The following are key capabilities in developing transgenic crops:


Ability to find useful genes: Syngenta is capitalizing on its pioneering work in mapping the rice genome and also accessing external sources through its collaborations
with various university labs around the world and through its Diversa strategic alliance.

Plant transformation: This is the process of introducing new genes into the existing genetic constitution of plants. Pioneering work in this area is done in
Syngentas research center at SBI.

Use of marker genes: There has been significant public and regulatory debate over the use of microbial antibiotic resistance as a marker technology. Syngenta has
developed and patented an alternative sugar based system trademarked Positech that is widely used by researchers.

Trait expression: This is the process of regulating genes to achieve various levels of expression in different tissues. This is achieved through specialized promoter DNA
sequences. Syngentas work with the rice genome has resulted in the discovery and patenting of a wide range of promoters.

31









All biotechnology products are subject to intense regulatory scrutiny. An extensive Syngenta network of regulatory specialists around the world ensures continued dialogue and compliance with the authorities regarding
regulatory dossier submissions, insect resistance management programs and participation in further development of the biotech regulatory framework. 

Total research and development spending for Plant Science was US$100 million in 2005, US$124 million in 2004 and US$109 million in 2003. 
Principal Markets
The market environment for products enhanced through biotechnology is complex. In the Americas, Australia and Asia, benefits such as better protection from pests and improved farming efficiency have been realized and
the technology widely accepted. Although there has been progress recently in the European market, consumer opinion is mixed and the regulatory framework remains stalled. 
Competition

The major investors in biotechnology are the main
crop protection and seed companies: Monsanto, DuPont/Pioneer, Syngenta, Bayer
and Dow. The majority of the transgenic products commercialized to date are traits
that  improve performance and farming efficiency in major world crops such as
corn, soya, cotton and canola (input traits). As a result, access to germplasm
as a platform for trait commercialization is a key competitive advantage. In
the future, we expect  that increased emphasis will be placed on developing products
that provide benefits to food and feed processors, retail trade and consumers
(output traits). One future competitive advantage is expected to be the ability
to develop partnerships to  allow delivery of biotechnology traits to the target
market sectors. In the future, Syngentas move into new markets may result
in other companies becoming competitors. In the animal feed market, for example,
major companies include DSM,  Novozymes, Danisco and BASF. 
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property laws protect products developed through biotechnology in the countries in which they are made and marketed.  Syngenta takes advantage of the full spectrum of intellectual property laws, including
utility patents, plant variety protection certificates, plant breeders rights, plant patents, trade secrets, and trademarks.  The level and type of protection varies from country to country according to local laws and international agreements.
Syngenta has one of the broadest patent and trademark portfolios in the industry. In addition to income from development and commercialization of transgenic products, income is generated from licensing arrangements. Syngenta respects the
intellectual property rights of others and will defend its intellectual property rights as necessary. 
Government Regulation
The field-testing, production, import, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and numerous government approvals. 

Registration and re-registration procedures apply in all major markets. 

Products must obtain governmental regulatory approval prior to marketing.  The regulatory framework for such products is designed to ensure the protection of the consumer, the grower and the environment.  Examples of
the regulatory bodies governing the science include the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration. 

Regulatory bodies can require ongoing review of products derived from biotechnology based upon many factors including the need for insect resistance management.  Even after approval, products can be reviewed with the
goal of ensuring that they continue to adhere to all standards, which may have changed or been added to since the product was initially approved. This type of ongoing review applies in most major markets. 

Government regulations, regulatory systems, and the politics that influence them vary widely among jurisdictions. Obtaining necessary regulatory approval is time consuming and costly, and there can be no guarantee of
the timing or success in obtaining approvals.

To drive near term success, Plant Science has put emphasis on the
commercialization of close-to-market projects that are aligned with the
strengths of the Syngenta Crop Protection and Seeds businesses. Syngentas 2004
acquisitions of Garst and Golden Harvest to strengthen its business in
the North American corn and soybean seed business and the licensing of
biotechnology products for cotton to Delta and Pine Land Company are expected to
increase the availability and penetration of Syngenta biotech traits when
commercialized. Following the acquisitions, corn trait development activities
have been transferred to the Seeds business as part of Field Crops, where future
commercial benefits will be realized.
For the longer term, Syngenta is exploring
opportunities in emerging areas of biotechnology such as enzymes and plant made
pharmaceuticals. The latter has the potential to make the next generation of
medicines more readily available to patients. Some of the Plant Science projects
described here are within five years of commercial availability.

Bayer and Dow. The majority of the transgenic products commercialized to date
are traits that improve performance and farming efficiency in major world crops
such as corn, soya, cotton and canola (input traits). As a result, access to
germplasm as a platform for trait commercialization is a key competitive
advantage. In the future, we expect that increased emphasis will be placed on
developing products that provide benefits to food and feed processors, retail
trade and consumers (output traits). One future competitive advantage is
expected to be the ability to develop partnerships to allow delivery of
biotechnology traits to the target market sectors. In the future, Syngentas
move into new markets may result in other companies becoming competitors. In the
animal feed market, for example, major companies include DSM and
BASF.

Intellectual
Property
Intellectual property laws protect products
developed through biotechnology in the countries in which they are made and
marketed. Syngenta takes advantage of the full spectrum of intellectual property
laws, including utility patents, plant variety protection certificates, plant
breeders rights, plant patents, trade secrets, and trademarks. The level and
type of protection varies from country to country according to local laws and
international agreements. Syngenta has one of the broadest patent and trademark
portfolios in the industry. In addition to income from development and
commercialization of transgenic products, income is generated from licensing
arrangements. Syngenta respects the intellectual property rights of others and
will defend its intellectual property rights as necessary.
Government Regulation
The field-testing, production, import, marketing
and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and numerous
government approvals.
Registration and re-registration procedures
apply in all major markets.
Products must obtain governmental regulatory
approval prior to marketing. The regulatory framework for such products is
designed to ensure the protection of the consumer, the grower and the
environment. Examples of the regulatory bodies governing the science include the
US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Food and Drug
Administration.
Regulatory bodies can require ongoing review of
products derived from biotechnology based upon many factors including the need
for insect resistance management. Even after approval, products can be reviewed
with the goal of ensuring that they continue to adhere to all standards, which
may have changed or been added to since the product was initially approved. This
type of ongoing review applies in most major markets.
Government regulations, regulatory systems, and
the politics that influence them vary widely among jurisdictions. Obtaining
necessary regulatory approval is time consuming and costly, and there can be no
guarantee of the timing or success in obtaining approvals.EXCERPTS ON THIS PAGE:20-FMar 1, 200620-FMar 16, 2005RELATED TOPICS for SYT:Competitive EnvironmentProducts DevelopmentVIEW MORE"Production" elsewhere: Cal-Maine Foods (CALM)

History[edit]




Syngenta headquarters in Basel


Based in Basel, Switzerland, Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.[4][5] Its roots are considerably older.
Novartis was formed of the 1996 merger of the three Swiss companies:[6] Geigy, which has roots back to 1758;[7] Sandoz Laboratories which was founded in 1876;[citation needed] and Ciba, founded in 1884.[8] Ciba and Geigy had merged in 1971 and had concentrated mainly on crop protection in its agro division,[citation needed] Sandoz more on seeds.[citation needed]




Syngenta works in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire originally owned by ICI.


Zeneca Agrochemicals was part of AstraZeneca, and formerly of Imperial Chemical Industries. ICI was formed in the UK in 1926. Two years later, work began at the Agricultural Research Station at Jealotts Hill near Bracknell.[9]
In 2004, Syngenta Seeds purchased Garst, the North American corn and soybean business of Advanta, as well as Golden Harvest Seeds.[10][11] On 5 December 2004, the European Union ended a six-year moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by Monsanto and its Swiss rival, Syngenta.[12]
In 2005, Syngenta opposed a Swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms.[13] On 28 November 2005, Switzerland enacted a five-year ban on the farming of genetically modified crops, underscoring the problems facing the European Commission and biotech companies like Syngenta, Bayer and Monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety.[14]
As of 2014[update] Syngenta's main competitors are Monsanto Company, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.[15]
In 2014, Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta for a reported $40 billion, but Syngenta rejected the offer.[2][16] Since April 2015 Monsanto and Syngenta had been working with their investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs respectively on a deal. The U.S. Treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion.[17] Syngenta's Board of Directors rejected an even better offer by Monsanto during August 2015, and Monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on 26 August.[18]
According to the Swiss business weekly, Finanz und Wirtschaft, many Syngenta shareholders were enraged, both by the company's refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with Monsanto, and with the subsequent offer withdrawal.[19][20] This resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the Alliance of Critical Syngenta Shareholders, which urged the Board to "evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice".[21]
In a recent interview, Chairman Michel Demaré was asked whether Syngenta could remain independent. He responded, "If you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize, then it would be possible. But in these circumstances, where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price, what they think this company is worth, it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months."[22] He thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold, especially given industry consolidation, which is creating larger competitors.
The failed Monsanto buyout caused Syngenta shares to increase by nearly 40%. In February 2016, ChemChina, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, offered to purchase Syngenta for $43 billion (480 Swiss francs per share), a deal which the company "unanimously recommended to shareholders”.[23] In April 2017, the Federal Trade Commission, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the European Commissioner for Competition approved of the acquisition, allowing the largest foreign takeover in Chinese history to proceed.[24] To secure approval, ChemChina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin, and chlorothalonil.[25][26] As an additional condition for the acquisition, 67 percent of the shareholders of Syngenta had to offer their shares to ChemChina. According to a press release, over 80 percent of shareholders agreed to the takeover by May 4, 2017. Therefore, the transaction is planned to close on June 7, 2017.[27]

Three product lines for seed products include corn and soya, other field crops and vegetables.[37][page needed] In 2014, sales from crop protection products accounted for US $11.381 billion, i.e. 75% of total sales.[38][page needed] Field crop seeds include both hybrid seeds and genetically engineered seeds, some of which enter the food chain and become part of genetically modified food. According to Syngenta, in the US their "proprietary triple stack corn seeds expanded to represent around 25 percent of units sold." [39] In 2010, the US EPA approved insecticidal trait stacks including Syngenta's AGRISURE VIPTERA™ gene, which offers resistance to certain corn pests.[39] Syngenta cross-licenses its proprietary genes with Dow AgroSciences and thus is able to include Dow's Herculex I and Herculex RW insect resistance traits in its seeds.[39] It sells a VMAX soybean that is resistant to glyphosate herbicide.[39]
Key Syngenta brands include Actara (Thiamethoxam), Agrisure (corn with Viptera trait), Alto (Cyproconazole), Amistar (azoxystrobin), Avicta, Axial, Bicep II, Bravo, Callisto, Celest, Cruiser (TMX, Thiamethoxam), Dividend, Dual, Durivo, Elatus, Fusilade, Force, Golden Harvest, Gramoxone, Hilleshoeg, Karate, Northrup-King (NK), Proclaim, Revus, Ridomil, Rogers, Score, Seguris, S&G, Tilt, Topik, Touchdown, Vertimec and Vibrance.[37]
Current products[edit]
Atrazine is an herbicide of the triazine class. Atrazine is used to prevent pre- and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.
It is one of the most widely used herbicides in US[40] and Australian agriculture.[41] Atrazine has been banned in the European Union.[42] There has been controversy over atrazine's effects on amphibians,[42] but the EPA has concluded "that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development".[43]
The European Commission decided to suspend use of the company's insecticide Cruiser (thiamethoxam, TMX) on crops pollinated by bees.[44] Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.[45]
Former products[edit]
Syngenta's predecessor, Ciba-Geigy, introduced the insecticide Galecron chlordimeform in 1966, and it was removed from the market in 1988.[46] In 1976, Ciba-Geigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing long-term toxicology studies - particularly studies to determine if long-term exposure could cause cancer - showed that it was causing cancer, and that it has already started to monitor its workers' exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers.[47]:8–9 Ciba-Geigy then applied for, and was granted, permission to market Galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton.[48] However, as further long term monitoring data was obtained, regulators banned chlordimeform in 1988. In a 1995 class action in the US, Ciba-Geigy agreed to cover costs for employee health monitoring and treatment. In 2005, Syngenta reported that employee health monitoring was continuing at the company's Monthey, Switzerland site.[49]
Biofuels[edit]
Like many agriculture companies, Syngenta also works in the biofuel space. In 2011, it announced the corn trait ENOGEN to reduce substantially the consumption of water and energy versus conventional corn.[50] Several ethanol producers plan to process such improved corn.[37] For example, Syngenta has signed a commercial agreement with Three Rivers Energy, LLC of Coshocton, Ohio, US to use grain featuring Enogen trait technology following the 2014 corn harvest.[51]
In 2007, Queensland University in Australia contracted with Syngenta to research different inputs for biofuels as a renewable energy source.[52]
Corporate structure[edit]
Syngenta is led by CEO J. Erik Fyrwald. The other Directors are Vinita Bali, Stefan Borgas, Gunnar Brock, David Lawrence, Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Eveline Saupper, Jacques Vincent, and Jürg Witmer.[37] Syngenta is listed on both the Swiss stock exchange and in New York.[37][page needed] Syngenta employs over 28,000 people in over 90 countries.[citation needed]
Litigation[edit]
In 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Syngenta which had filed a suit against Bayer for patent infringement on a class of neonicotinoid insecticides. The following year Syngenta filed suits against Monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its U.S. biotechnology patents covering genetically modified corn and cotton. In 2004, it again filed a suit against Monsanto, claiming antitrust violations related to the U.S. biotech corn seed market, and Monsanto countersued. Monsanto and Syngenta settled all litigation in 2008.[53]
Syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of Greenville, Illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies. The suit was settled for $105 million in May 2012.[54][55][56] A similar case involving six states has been in federal court since 2010.[57][58]
In the US, Syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding Viptera genetically modified corn. The plaintiffs in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports.[59] Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and NCGA-recommended export approvals, but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, and at the time was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports.[60] For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US.[61] That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection.[62] China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.[citation needed] Syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial, in Kansas on June 23 2017, and was ordered to pay the farmers $217 million.[63] However, Syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict.
Controversies[edit]
Brazil[edit]
On 21 October 2007, a Brazilian peasant organization, the Landless Workers' Movement (Portuguese: Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST), led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the company's seed research farms, in protest against genetically-engineered ("genetically modified") vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate. After the occupation had begun, a team from NF Security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued. A protestor and a security guard were killed, and some protesters and security guards were wounded.[64]
The Brazilian police investigation completed in November 2007 blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of NF Security; the leader of MST was blamed for trespassing. The inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg. The security guard was shot in the head. Eight others were injured, five of them landless.[65]
The Civil Court of Cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on 20 December 2007[66] and on 12 June 2008, the remaining MST members left the Santa Teresa site they had been occupying.[67] On 14 October 2008, Syngenta donated the 123-hectare station to the Agronomy Institute of Paraná (IAPAR) for research into biodiversity, recovery of degraded areas and agriculture production systems, as well as environmental education programs.[68]
Court case
In November 2015, Judge Pedro Ivo Moreiro, of the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel, ruled that Syngenta must pay compensation to the family of Valmir Mota de Oliveira ("Keno"), who was killed in the attack, and to Isabel Nascimento dos Santos who was injured.[69][70] In his sentence the judge stated that "to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality, since […] there is no doubt that, in truth, it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property".[71][72] The version of events put forward by Syngenta was rejected by the Court. In May 2010 Syngenta was condemned by the IV Permanent People's Tribunal for human rights violations in Brazil.[73]
Conflict with Tyrone Hayes[edit]
There has been a long running conflict between Syngenta and University of California at Berkeley biologist Tyrone Hayes.
According to an article in the 10 February 2014, issue of The New Yorker, Syngenta's public-relations team took steps to discredit Hayes, whose research is purported to suggest that the Syngenta-produced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs. The article states that the company paid third-party critics to write articles discrediting Hayes's work, planned to have his wife investigated, and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by Hayes.[42]
During a 21 February interview conducted on Democracy Now, Hayes reiterated the claims.[74] After the interview aired, Syngenta denied targeting Hayes or making any threats, calling those statements "uncorroborated and intentionally damaging" and demanding a retraction and public apology from Hayes and Democracy Now.[75]
In 2010 Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists. Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having "unprofessional and offensive" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.[76][77]
The issue has been described as "one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science”, by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.[78]

Lobbying in the US[edit]
Syngenta's contributions to US federal candidates, parties, and outside groups totaled $267,902 during 2012, ranking it 10th on the list of companies in its sector.[79] Its lobbying expenditures in the US during 2012 were $1,150,000, ranking it 7th in its sector.[80]
Syngenta Foundation[edit]
The objectives and goals of the Syngenta Foundation are "to work with rural communities in the Semi-arid regions of the world and improve their livelihoods."[81] This non-profit organization supports sustainable food security projects in a number of countries.[82] The Syngenta Foundation addressed the World Food Day Symposium in 2005 as an output of the Millennium Ecosystem Report.[83]
Awards and community involvement[edit]
In 2007, Syngenta's Canadian division was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, one of only a handful of agribusiness firms to receive this honour.[84] In October 2008, Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, Inc. was recognized as one of Waterloo Area's Top Employers, as announced in the Waterloo Region Record, Guelph Mercury and Cambridge Times.[85] In 2011, Syngenta was named among the top 10 employers in biotechnology by Science magazine.[86] The 2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index named Syngenta one of the best performing chemical companies worldwide. Syngenta was one of five chemical companies in the World and Europe indices based on economic, social and environmental performance.[87][non-primary source needed]
In 2013, Syngenta announced a set of corporate goals to improve agricultural resource utilization, environmental stewardship, productivity, and education, particularly in poverty-stricken areas.[88]

History[edit]




Syngenta headquarters in Basel


Based in Basel, Switzerland, Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.[4][5] Its roots are considerably older.
Novartis was formed of the 1996 merger of the three Swiss companies:[6] Geigy, which has roots back to 1758;[7] Sandoz Laboratories which was founded in 1876;[citation needed] and Ciba, founded in 1884.[8] Ciba and Geigy had merged in 1971 and had concentrated mainly on crop protection in its agro division,[citation needed] Sandoz more on seeds.[citation needed]




Syngenta works in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire originally owned by ICI.


Zeneca Agrochemicals was part of AstraZeneca, and formerly of Imperial Chemical Industries. ICI was formed in the UK in 1926. Two years later, work began at the Agricultural Research Station at Jealotts Hill near Bracknell.[9]
In 2004, Syngenta Seeds purchased Garst, the North American corn and soybean business of Advanta, as well as Golden Harvest Seeds.[10][11] On 5 December 2004, the European Union ended a six-year moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by Monsanto and its Swiss rival, Syngenta.[12]
In 2005, Syngenta opposed a Swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms.[13] On 28 November 2005, Switzerland enacted a five-year ban on the farming of genetically modified crops, underscoring the problems facing the European Commission and biotech companies like Syngenta, Bayer and Monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety.[14]
As of 2014[update] Syngenta's main competitors are Monsanto Company, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.[15]
In 2014, Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta for a reported $40 billion, but Syngenta rejected the offer.[2][16] Since April 2015 Monsanto and Syngenta had been working with their investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs respectively on a deal. The U.S. Treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion.[17] Syngenta's Board of Directors rejected an even better offer by Monsanto during August 2015, and Monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on 26 August.[18]
According to the Swiss business weekly, Finanz und Wirtschaft, many Syngenta shareholders were enraged, both by the company's refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with Monsanto, and with the subsequent offer withdrawal.[19][20] This resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the Alliance of Critical Syngenta Shareholders, which urged the Board to "evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice".[21]
In a recent interview, Chairman Michel Demaré was asked whether Syngenta could remain independent. He responded, "If you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize, then it would be possible. But in these circumstances, where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price, what they think this company is worth, it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months."[22] He thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold, especially given industry consolidation, which is creating larger competitors.
The failed Monsanto buyout caused Syngenta shares to increase by nearly 40%. In February 2016, ChemChina, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, offered to purchase Syngenta for $43 billion (480 Swiss francs per share), a deal which the company "unanimously recommended to shareholders”.[23] In April 2017, the Federal Trade Commission, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the European Commissioner for Competition approved of the acquisition, allowing the largest foreign takeover in Chinese history to proceed.[24] To secure approval, ChemChina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin, and chlorothalonil.[25][26] As an additional condition for the acquisition, 67 percent of the shareholders of Syngenta had to offer their shares to ChemChina. According to a press release, over 80 percent of shareholders agreed to the takeover by May 4, 2017. Therefore, the transaction is planned to close on June 7, 2017.[27]

Products[edit]
Syngenta has eight primary product lines which it develops, markets and sells worldwide; Its five product lines for pesticides are selective herbicides, non-selective herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and seed care. Three product lines for seed products include corn and soya, other field crops and vegetables.[37][page needed] In 2014, sales from crop protection products accounted for US $11.381 billion, i.e. 75% of total sales.[38][page needed] Field crop seeds include both hybrid seeds and genetically engineered seeds, some of which enter the food chain and become part of genetically modified food. According to Syngenta, in the US their "proprietary triple stack corn seeds expanded to represent around 25 percent of units sold." [39] In 2010, the US EPA approved insecticidal trait stacks including Syngenta's AGRISURE VIPTERA™ gene, which offers resistance to certain corn pests.[39] Syngenta cross-licenses its proprietary genes with Dow AgroSciences and thus is able to include Dow's Herculex I and Herculex RW insect resistance traits in its seeds.[39] It sells a VMAX soybean that is resistant to glyphosate herbicide.[39]

Atrazine is an herbicide of the triazine class. Atrazine is used to prevent pre- and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.
It is one of the most widely used herbicides in US[40] and Australian agriculture.[41] Atrazine has been banned in the European Union.[42] There has been controversy over atrazine's effects on amphibians,[42] but the EPA has concluded "that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development".[43]
The European Commission decided to suspend use of the company's insecticide Cruiser (thiamethoxam, TMX) on crops pollinated by bees.[44] Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.[45]
Former products[edit]
Syngenta's predecessor, Ciba-Geigy, introduced the insecticide Galecron chlordimeform in 1966, and it was removed from the market in 1988.[46] In 1976, Ciba-Geigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing long-term toxicology studies - particularly studies to determine if long-term exposure could cause cancer - showed that it was causing cancer, and that it has already started to monitor its workers' exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers.[47]:8–9 Ciba-Geigy then applied for, and was granted, permission to market Galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton.[48] However, as further long term monitoring data was obtained, regulators banned chlordimeform in 1988. In a 1995 class action in the US, Ciba-Geigy agreed to cover costs for employee health monitoring and treatment. In 2005, Syngenta reported that employee health monitoring was continuing at the company's Monthey, Switzerland site.[49]
Biofuels[edit]
Like many agriculture companies, Syngenta also works in the biofuel space. In 2011, it announced the corn trait ENOGEN to reduce substantially the consumption of water and energy versus conventional corn.[50] Several ethanol producers plan to process such improved corn.[37] For example, Syngenta has signed a commercial agreement with Three Rivers Energy, LLC of Coshocton, Ohio, US to use grain featuring Enogen trait technology following the 2014 corn harvest.[51]
In 2007, Queensland University in Australia contracted with Syngenta to research different inputs for biofuels as a renewable energy source.[52]
Corporate structure[edit]
Syngenta is led by CEO J. Erik Fyrwald. The other Directors are Vinita Bali, Stefan Borgas, Gunnar Brock, David Lawrence, Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Eveline Saupper, Jacques Vincent, and Jürg Witmer.[37] Syngenta is listed on both the Swiss stock exchange and in New York.[37][page needed] Syngenta employs over 28,000 people in over 90 countries.[citation needed]
Litigation[edit]
In 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Syngenta which had filed a suit against Bayer for patent infringement on a class of neonicotinoid insecticides. The following year Syngenta filed suits against Monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its U.S. biotechnology patents covering genetically modified corn and cotton. In 2004, it again filed a suit against Monsanto, claiming antitrust violations related to the U.S. biotech corn seed market, and Monsanto countersued. Monsanto and Syngenta settled all litigation in 2008.[53]
Syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of Greenville, Illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies. The suit was settled for $105 million in May 2012.[54][55][56] A similar case involving six states has been in federal court since 2010.[57][58]
In the US, Syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding Viptera genetically modified corn. The plaintiffs in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports.[59] Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and NCGA-recommended export approvals, but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, and at the time was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports.[60] For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US.[61] That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection.[62] China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.[citation needed] Syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial, in Kansas on June 23 2017, and was ordered to pay the farmers $217 million.[63] However, Syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict.
Controversies[edit]
Brazil[edit]
On 21 October 2007, a Brazilian peasant organization, the Landless Workers' Movement (Portuguese: Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST), led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the company's seed research farms, in protest against genetically-engineered ("genetically modified") vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate. After the occupation had begun, a team from NF Security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued. A protestor and a security guard were killed, and some protesters and security guards were wounded.[64]
The Brazilian police investigation completed in November 2007 blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of NF Security; the leader of MST was blamed for trespassing. The inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg. The security guard was shot in the head. Eight others were injured, five of them landless.[65]
The Civil Court of Cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on 20 December 2007[66] and on 12 June 2008, the remaining MST members left the Santa Teresa site they had been occupying.[67] On 14 October 2008, Syngenta donated the 123-hectare station to the Agronomy Institute of Paraná (IAPAR) for research into biodiversity, recovery of degraded areas and agriculture production systems, as well as environmental education programs.[68]
Court case
In November 2015, Judge Pedro Ivo Moreiro, of the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel, ruled that Syngenta must pay compensation to the family of Valmir Mota de Oliveira ("Keno"), who was killed in the attack, and to Isabel Nascimento dos Santos who was injured.[69][70] In his sentence the judge stated that "to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality, since […] there is no doubt that, in truth, it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property".[71][72] The version of events put forward by Syngenta was rejected by the Court. In May 2010 Syngenta was condemned by the IV Permanent People's Tribunal for human rights violations in Brazil.[73]
Conflict with Tyrone Hayes[edit]
There has been a long running conflict between Syngenta and University of California at Berkeley biologist Tyrone Hayes.
According to an article in the 10 February 2014, issue of The New Yorker, Syngenta's public-relations team took steps to discredit Hayes, whose research is purported to suggest that the Syngenta-produced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs. The article states that the company paid third-party critics to write articles discrediting Hayes's work, planned to have his wife investigated, and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by Hayes.[42]
During a 21 February interview conducted on Democracy Now, Hayes reiterated the claims.[74] After the interview aired, Syngenta denied targeting Hayes or making any threats, calling those statements "uncorroborated and intentionally damaging" and demanding a retraction and public apology from Hayes and Democracy Now.[75]
In 2010 Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists. Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having "unprofessional and offensive" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.[76][77]
The issue has been described as "one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science”, by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.[78]

Lobbying in the US[edit]
Syngenta's contributions to US federal candidates, parties, and outside groups totaled $267,902 during 2012, ranking it 10th on the list of companies in its sector.[79] Its lobbying expenditures in the US during 2012 were $1,150,000, ranking it 7th in its sector.[80]
Syngenta Foundation[edit]
The objectives and goals of the Syngenta Foundation are "to work with rural communities in the Semi-arid regions of the world and improve their livelihoods."[81] This non-profit organization supports sustainable food security projects in a number of countries.[82] The Syngenta Foundation addressed the World Food Day Symposium in 2005 as an output of the Millennium Ecosystem Report.[83]
Awards and community involvement[edit]
In 2007, Syngenta's Canadian division was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, one of only a handful of agribusiness firms to receive this honour.[84] In October 2008, Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, Inc. was recognized as one of Waterloo Area's Top Employers, as announced in the Waterloo Region Record, Guelph Mercury and Cambridge Times.[85] In 2011, Syngenta was named among the top 10 employers in biotechnology by Science magazine.[86] The 2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index named Syngenta one of the best performing chemical companies worldwide. Syngenta was one of five chemical companies in the World and Europe indices based on economic, social and environmental performance.[87][non-primary source needed]
In 2013, Syngenta announced a set of corporate goals to improve agricultural resource utilization, environmental stewardship, productivity, and education, particularly in poverty-stricken areas.[88]

History[edit]




Syngenta headquarters in Basel


Based in Basel, Switzerland, Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.[4][5] Its roots are considerably older.
Novartis was formed of the 1996 merger of the three Swiss companies:[6] Geigy, which has roots back to 1758;[7] Sandoz Laboratories which was founded in 1876;[citation needed] and Ciba, founded in 1884.[8] Ciba and Geigy had merged in 1971 and had concentrated mainly on crop protection in its agro division,[citation needed] Sandoz more on seeds.[citation needed]




Syngenta works in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire originally owned by ICI.


Zeneca Agrochemicals was part of AstraZeneca, and formerly of Imperial Chemical Industries. ICI was formed in the UK in 1926. Two years later, work began at the Agricultural Research Station at Jealotts Hill near Bracknell.[9]
In 2004, Syngenta Seeds purchased Garst, the North American corn and soybean business of Advanta, as well as Golden Harvest Seeds.[10][11] On 5 December 2004, the European Union ended a six-year moratorium when it approved imports of two varieties of genetically modified corn sold by Monsanto and its Swiss rival, Syngenta.[12]
In 2005, Syngenta opposed a Swiss ban on genetically engineered organisms.[13] On 28 November 2005, Switzerland enacted a five-year ban on the farming of genetically modified crops, underscoring the problems facing the European Commission and biotech companies like Syngenta, Bayer and Monsanto as they try to overcome consumer doubts about safety.[14]
As of 2014[update] Syngenta's main competitors are Monsanto Company, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer.[15]
In 2014, Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta for a reported $40 billion, but Syngenta rejected the offer.[2][16] Since April 2015 Monsanto and Syngenta had been working with their investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs respectively on a deal. The U.S. Treasury tried to stop the deal for tax inversion.[17] Syngenta's Board of Directors rejected an even better offer by Monsanto during August 2015, and Monsanto withdrew from the negotiations on 26 August.[18]
According to the Swiss business weekly, Finanz und Wirtschaft, many Syngenta shareholders were enraged, both by the company's refusal to enter into takeover negotiations with Monsanto, and with the subsequent offer withdrawal.[19][20] This resulted in a group of investors responding by creating the Alliance of Critical Syngenta Shareholders, which urged the Board to "evaluate all options for value creation without prejudice".[21]
In a recent interview, Chairman Michel Demaré was asked whether Syngenta could remain independent. He responded, "If you have the patience to wait for cycles to materialize, then it would be possible. But in these circumstances, where our shareholders have a kind of a benchmark share price, what they think this company is worth, it is very difficult to say that we can deliver this in the next twelve months."[22] He thereby acknowledged that the company needs to be sold, especially given industry consolidation, which is creating larger competitors.
The failed Monsanto buyout caused Syngenta shares to increase by nearly 40%. In February 2016, ChemChina, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, offered to purchase Syngenta for $43 billion (480 Swiss francs per share), a deal which the company "unanimously recommended to shareholders”.[23] In April 2017, the Federal Trade Commission, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, and the European Commissioner for Competition approved of the acquisition, allowing the largest foreign takeover in Chinese history to proceed.[24] To secure approval, ChemChina agreed to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin, and chlorothalonil.[25][26] As an additional condition for the acquisition, 67 percent of the shareholders of Syngenta had to offer their shares to ChemChina. According to a press release, over 80 percent of shareholders agreed to the takeover by May 4, 2017. Therefore, the transaction is planned to close on June 7, 2017.[27]

Products[edit]
Syngenta has eight primary product lines which it develops, markets and sells worldwide; Its five product lines for pesticides are selective herbicides, non-selective herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and seed care. Three product lines for seed products include corn and soya, other field crops and vegetables.[37][page needed] In 2014, sales from crop protection products accounted for US $11.381 billion, i.e. 75% of total sales.[38][page needed] Field crop seeds include both hybrid seeds and genetically engineered seeds, some of which enter the food chain and become part of genetically modified food. According to Syngenta, in the US their "proprietary triple stack corn seeds expanded to represent around 25 percent of units sold." [39] In 2010, the US EPA approved insecticidal trait stacks including Syngenta's AGRISURE VIPTERA™ gene, which offers resistance to certain corn pests.[39] Syngenta cross-licenses its proprietary genes with Dow AgroSciences and thus is able to include Dow's Herculex I and Herculex RW insect resistance traits in its seeds.[39] It sells a VMAX soybean that is resistant to glyphosate herbicide.[39]
Key Syngenta brands include Actara (Thiamethoxam), Agrisure (corn with Viptera trait), Alto (Cyproconazole), Amistar (azoxystrobin), Avicta, Axial, Bicep II, Bravo, Callisto, Celest, Cruiser (TMX, Thiamethoxam), Dividend, Dual, Durivo, Elatus, Fusilade, Force, Golden Harvest, Gramoxone, Hilleshoeg, Karate, Northrup-King (NK), Proclaim, Revus, Ridomil, Rogers, Score, Seguris, S&G, Tilt, Topik, Touchdown, Vertimec and Vibrance.[37]
Current products[edit]
Atrazine is an herbicide of the triazine class. Atrazine is used to prevent pre- and post-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn) and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns.
It is one of the most widely used herbicides in US[40] and Australian agriculture.[41] Atrazine has been banned in the European Union.[42] There has been controversy over atrazine's effects on amphibians,[42] but the EPA has concluded "that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development".[43]
The European Commission decided to suspend use of the company's insecticide Cruiser (thiamethoxam, TMX) on crops pollinated by bees.[44] Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court.[45]
Former products[edit]
Syngenta's predecessor, Ciba-Geigy, introduced the insecticide Galecron chlordimeform in 1966, and it was removed from the market in 1988.[46] In 1976, Ciba-Geigy told regulatory authorities that it was temporarily withdrawing chlordimeform because ongoing long-term toxicology studies - particularly studies to determine if long-term exposure could cause cancer - showed that it was causing cancer, and that it has already started to monitor its workers' exposure and had found chlordimeform and its metabolites in the urine of its workers.[47]:8–9 Ciba-Geigy then applied for, and was granted, permission to market Galecron at lower doses for use only on cotton.[48] However, as further long term monitoring data was obtained, regulators banned chlordimeform in 1988. In a 1995 class action in the US, Ciba-Geigy agreed to cover costs for employee health monitoring and treatment. In 2005, Syngenta reported that employee health monitoring was continuing at the company's Monthey, Switzerland site.[49]
Biofuels[edit]
Like many agriculture companies, Syngenta also works in the biofuel space. In 2011, it announced the corn trait ENOGEN to reduce substantially the consumption of water and energy versus conventional corn.[50] Several ethanol producers plan to process such improved corn.[37] For example, Syngenta has signed a commercial agreement with Three Rivers Energy, LLC of Coshocton, Ohio, US to use grain featuring Enogen trait technology following the 2014 corn harvest.[51]
In 2007, Queensland University in Australia contracted with Syngenta to research different inputs for biofuels as a renewable energy source.[52]
Corporate structure[edit]
Syngenta is led by CEO J. Erik Fyrwald. The other Directors are Vinita Bali, Stefan Borgas, Gunnar Brock, David Lawrence, Eleni Gabre-Madhin, Eveline Saupper, Jacques Vincent, and Jürg Witmer.[37] Syngenta is listed on both the Swiss stock exchange and in New York.[37][page needed] Syngenta employs over 28,000 people in over 90 countries.[citation needed]
Litigation[edit]
In 2001, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Syngenta which had filed a suit against Bayer for patent infringement on a class of neonicotinoid insecticides. The following year Syngenta filed suits against Monsanto and other companies claiming infringement of its U.S. biotechnology patents covering genetically modified corn and cotton. In 2004, it again filed a suit against Monsanto, claiming antitrust violations related to the U.S. biotech corn seed market, and Monsanto countersued. Monsanto and Syngenta settled all litigation in 2008.[53]
Syngenta was defendant in a class action lawsuit by the city of Greenville, Illinois concerning the adverse effects of atrazine in human water supplies. The suit was settled for $105 million in May 2012.[54][55][56] A similar case involving six states has been in federal court since 2010.[57][58]
In the US, Syngenta is facing lawsuits from farmers and shipping companies regarding Viptera genetically modified corn. The plaintiffs in nearly 30 states contend that Syngenta's introduction of Viptera drove down US grain market prices, leading to financial harm, and that Syngenta acted irresponsibly by doing too little to enable shipping companies to export the grain to approved ports.[59] Before Viptera's 2010 introduction Syngenta secured all US and NCGA-recommended export approvals, but none from China. China had imported little to no US grain prior to 2010, and at the time was not considered a major partner, but it became a major partner in 2010, when it dramatically increased US grain imports.[60] For three years, China imported U.S. Viptera grain without formal approval. In November 2013, Chinese officials destroyed a U.S. grain shipment containing Viptera grain, started rejecting all US shipments with the GM grain, but continued to accept it from all countries other than the US.[61] That same year, US corn market prices dropped $4 per bushel, causing over $2.9B in losses, with just over half of that loss occurring prior to China's November rejection.[62] China later approved the GM corn in 2014 but US corn grain market prices have not rebounded.[citation needed] Syngenta lost the first lawsuit to reach trial, in Kansas on June 23 2017, and was ordered to pay the farmers $217 million.[63] However, Syngenta has stated it would appeal the verdict.
Controversies[edit]
Brazil[edit]
On 21 October 2007, a Brazilian peasant organization, the Landless Workers' Movement (Portuguese: Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST), led a group of landless farmers in an occupation of one of the company's seed research farms, in protest against genetically-engineered ("genetically modified") vegetables and in hopes of obtaining land for landless families to cultivate. After the occupation had begun, a team from NF Security arrived in a minibus and a fight with gunfire ensued. A protestor and a security guard were killed, and some protesters and security guards were wounded.[64]
The Brazilian police investigation completed in November 2007 blamed the confrontation and death of the protestor on nine employees and the owner of NF Security; the leader of MST was blamed for trespassing. The inquiry found that the protester was fatally shot in the abdomen and in the leg. The security guard was shot in the head. Eight others were injured, five of them landless.[65]
The Civil Court of Cascavel granted an order for the repossession of the site on 20 December 2007[66] and on 12 June 2008, the remaining MST members left the Santa Teresa site they had been occupying.[67] On 14 October 2008, Syngenta donated the 123-hectare station to the Agronomy Institute of Paraná (IAPAR) for research into biodiversity, recovery of degraded areas and agriculture production systems, as well as environmental education programs.[68]
Court case
In November 2015, Judge Pedro Ivo Moreiro, of the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel, ruled that Syngenta must pay compensation to the family of Valmir Mota de Oliveira ("Keno"), who was killed in the attack, and to Isabel Nascimento dos Santos who was injured.[69][70] In his sentence the judge stated that "to refer to what happened as a confrontation is to close one’s eyes to reality, since […] there is no doubt that, in truth, it was a massacre disguised as repossession of property".[71][72] The version of events put forward by Syngenta was rejected by the Court. In May 2010 Syngenta was condemned by the IV Permanent People's Tribunal for human rights violations in Brazil.[73]
Conflict with Tyrone Hayes[edit]
There has been a long running conflict between Syngenta and University of California at Berkeley biologist Tyrone Hayes.
According to an article in the 10 February 2014, issue of The New Yorker, Syngenta's public-relations team took steps to discredit Hayes, whose research is purported to suggest that the Syngenta-produced chemical atrazine was responsible for abnormal development of reproductive organs in frogs. The article states that the company paid third-party critics to write articles discrediting Hayes's work, planned to have his wife investigated, and planted hostile audience members at scientific talks given by Hayes.[42]
During a 21 February interview conducted on Democracy Now, Hayes reiterated the claims.[74] After the interview aired, Syngenta denied targeting Hayes or making any threats, calling those statements "uncorroborated and intentionally damaging" and demanding a retraction and public apology from Hayes and Democracy Now.[75]
In 2010 Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists. Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having "unprofessional and offensive" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.[76][77]
The issue has been described as "one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science”, by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.[78]

Lobbying in the US[edit]
Syngenta's contributions to US federal candidates, parties, and outside groups totaled $267,902 during 2012, ranking it 10th on the list of companies in its sector.[79] Its lobbying expenditures in the US during 2012 were $1,150,000, ranking it 7th in its sector.[80]
Syngenta Foundation[edit]
The objectives and goals of the Syngenta Foundation are "to work with rural communities in the Semi-arid regions of the world and improve their livelihoods."[81] This non-profit organization supports sustainable food security projects in a number of countries.[82] The Syngenta Foundation addressed the World Food Day Symposium in 2005 as an output of the Millennium Ecosystem Report.[83]
Awards and community involvement[edit]
In 2007, Syngenta's Canadian division was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean's magazine, one of only a handful of agribusiness firms to receive this honour.[84] In October 2008, Syngenta Crop Protection Canada, Inc. was recognized as one of Waterloo Area's Top Employers, as announced in the Waterloo Region Record, Guelph Mercury and Cambridge Times.[85] In 2011, Syngenta was named among the top 10 employers in biotechnology by Science magazine.[86] The 2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index named Syngenta one of the best performing chemical companies worldwide. Syngenta was one of five chemical companies in the World and Europe indices based on economic, social and environmental performance.[87][non-primary source needed]
In 2013, Syngenta announced a set of corporate goals to improve agricultural resource utilization, environmental stewardship, productivity, and education, particularly in poverty-stricken areas.[88]
