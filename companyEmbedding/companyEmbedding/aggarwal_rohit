Background







About Rohit


                            Hi:

I am an associate professor of information systems at the University of Utah. 
I am looking for a co-founder/business developer who is honest, hard-working, dreamer, and has an idea with demonstratable product-market fit. I can take care of the rest such as engineering, product development, raising seed round, and analytics. 

I have technical skills, project management skills, team building skills, access to investors for seed round and subsequent rounds. I am a trained applied statistician and teach data analytics classes. I have been working on a mentoring startup, MentorStudents.org. We are running on 15 high schools and on the University of Utah's website. See the popup/tab on the center of the right edge of the University's page: http://phd.business.utah.edu/page/information-systems; For high-school see here: http://west.slcschools.org/ . We built a complete conferencing solution from ground up that makes outbound calls and patches students to mentors. 


If you have sales and marketing experience, and have either an idea with demonstrable product-market fit or open to exploring my idea in recruitment space, then send me an email. 
Best,
Rohit Aggarwal
