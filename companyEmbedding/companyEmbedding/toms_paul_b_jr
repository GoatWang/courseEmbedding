This excerpt taken from the HOFT 8-K filed Jun 11, 2007.A  Paul Toms  Gordon, this Paul, and yes. There is about $10 million at selling price  wholesale price of product that we would like to get out of finished goods inventory. But, we also probably need to build our other inventories a little bit. So,
I dont think there is $10 million net that we will take on inventories. I think our inventory levels actually are approaching the point that we think they need to be to properly service the business. And, so, we are actually over the summer
will be in a mode of building inventories back to handle what typically, you know, is our strongest selling season starting right around Labor Day.  This excerpt taken from the HOFT 8-K filed Feb 12, 2007.A  Paul Toms  Well, weve never been in the business of forecasting profitability and I think if you were to look back historically at the company that was the norm, 10% operating income was something that we achieved several years and was typically
a goal and I think if you looked at the fourth quarter 06, prior to restructuring charges we were 10.3% operating income and we do feel like going forward that we have taken a tremendous amount of cost out of the company with termination of
the ESOP and closing of the margins were planned and just also grow like  a significant part of our warehousing and distributing costs are non-recurring and that the part related to the inventory build through the third, end of the fourth
quarter. But some of those offsite storage costs, demurrage and related warehousing and distributing costs should not recur going forward.  Q 
Todd Schwartzman  And if thats the case with your transition now almost complete in your shift in business model. You dont see any reason
for you know, not to return to those historical normal levels?

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

        Hooker Furniture acquires Pulaski company
    


MICKEY POWELL | Bulletin Staff Writer

Jan 6, 2016
 (…)


























































































Hooker Furniture, based in Martinsville, announced Wednesday that it will make its largest acquisition in its 91-year history.The company has agreed to buy Home Meridian International Inc. (HMI) for roughly $100 million.As a result of the purchase, Hooker’s corporate size will more than double – it will have about 900 employees worldwide – and it will be one of the top five players in the nationwide furniture market, company officials said.No jobs at either Hooker or HMI are expected to be eliminated due to the sale, said Paul B. Toms Jr., Hooker’s chairman and chief executive officer. No new jobs are expected to be created, either, he said.He estimated that the company has about 225 employees in the Martinsville-Henry County area.Although its headquarters remain in Martinsville, Hooker has not manufactured furniture locally since its wooden furniture plant closed eight years ago, Toms said in a phone interview.Hooker now “sells a lot of furniture sourced overseas,” he said, but it maintains upholstery plants in Bedford and Hickory, N.C.Its product lines include home entertainment, home office, accent, dining and bedroom furniture.Based in High Point, N.C., HMI is the parent company of five furniture makers, including Pulaski Furniture.Its brands “are all vibrant, well-run businesses,” Toms said.As part of the purchase, Hooker will acquire most of HMI’s assets and some of its liabilities, according to a company news release.The approximately $100 million sale price includes about $85 million in cash and about $15 million in newly-issued Hooker stock, the release stated.“Although Hooker Furniture Corp. has been debt-free for some time, we look at this acquisition as an excellent way to put excess capital to work and use our pristine balance sheet to layer in a manageable amount of low-cost debt,” Toms said in the release.It is anticipated that HMI will operate autonomously – with the same management team – as a division of Hooker which, with the acquisition, is expected to surpass the half-billion-dollar sales mark, the release stated.
“We are particularly impressed with the depth and experience of the HMI management team and excited about having this level of talent join us as we plan for the future,” Toms said.The companies had combined revenues of more than $550 million during the 12 months that ended Oct. 31, and total operating income for the two companies for the period was $35.6 million, according to the release.“While there will be no merger of operations or change in customer-facing services,” Toms said in the release, “we do see opportunity to improve each company by sharing best practices and looking for ways to work together to lower costs, improve efficiency and grow sales,” Toms said.“The HMI team is excited to join with Hooker Furniture Corp. to become one of the largest players in the (furniture) industry,” said HMI Chief Executive Officer George Revington. “The success of these two companies is directly related to how they serve their customers and the new combination will make us even more effective and provides a great platform for future growth.”Following the sale, Revington will report to Toms, the release stated.Hooker’s purchase of HMI is expected to be finalized between Feb. 1 and March 31, the release indicated. It noted that Hooker shareholders do not have to approve the sale.When the sale is completed, in addition to the Bedford and Hickory upholstery plants, the combined company will have showrooms in High Point and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, as well as eight distribution centers in Virginia, North Carolina, California, China and Vietnam.
