History[edit]
Through a series of acquisitions the company has grown to approximately 800 stores.
In June 1992, Stage Stores, then known as Specialty Retailers, Inc. (SRI), acquired Colorado-based Fashion Bar, Inc., a family-owned business with 71 stores, most of which were comparable to Palais Royal and Bealls. The remainder were small specialty stores known as Stage Stores, which had already become part of SRI's operation.
In 1996, SRI completed the closure of the other Fashion Bar Stores but retained the Stage name. The company purchased the forty-nine stores of Beall-Ladymon, Inc., sold by company president Horace Ladymon. The outlets were located in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi; they were reopened in 1994 under the "Stage" name.[4]
Stage expanded into the Northwest with the acquisition in 1997 of upscale C. R. Anthony Co. and Tri-North stores.
The company acquired Uhlmans in 1997 which brought Stage to Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana. All of these newly acquired stores, however, were closed by 1999 when Stage Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Closures as part of the bankruptcy included most of the former Fashion Bar, Milliken's, Tri-North, and Uhlman's stores, as well as an exodus from Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota.
Stores with the Stage nameplate still operate in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Oklahoma. Before the bankruptcy, Stage stores also operated in Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
In 2003, Stage Stores acquired 136 Peebles stores located in 17 states.
Stage Stores acquired Gordmans in 2017.[5]
Acquisitions[edit]
Stage Stores, Inc. has acquired many stores over the years, including the following:

Fashion Bar (Colorado, Wyoming). Acquired in 1992, all stores converted to Stage.
Beall-Ladymon (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi Kansas). Acquired in 1994, all stores converted to Stage.
Uhlman's (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio). Acquired in 1996. In addition to the Uhlman's name, Uhlman's operated Milliken's stores in Michigan. All were renamed Stage, except for a locations in Traverse City, Michigan, Cadillac, Michigan, and Manistee, Michigan which operated as Stage-Milliken until 2001.[6]
C. R. Anthony Co. (Montana, Idaho, Oregon, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Wyoming) Acquired 1997, most stores converted to Stage, while some Anthony's, such as those located in Amarillo, Texas, became Bealls locations.
Tri-North (Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington) Most of these locations operated as Hub Clothing Stores before the 1998 acquisition, when all 15 stores converted to Stage.
B. C. Moore & Sons, (Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina). Acquired February 2006. By November 2006, 69 of these 76 stores were converted to the Peebles name and format, and the other nine were closed.

All of these newly acquired stores, however, were closed by 1999 when Stage Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Closures as part of the bankruptcy included most of the former Fashion Bar, Milliken's, Tri-North, and Uhlman's stores, as well as an exodus from Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota.
Stores with the Stage nameplate still operate in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Oklahoma. Before the bankruptcy, Stage stores also operated in Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
In 2003, Stage Stores acquired 136 Peebles stores located in 17 states.
Stage Stores acquired Gordmans in 2017.[5]
Acquisitions[edit]
Stage Stores, Inc. has acquired many stores over the years, including the following:

Fashion Bar (Colorado, Wyoming). Acquired in 1992, all stores converted to Stage.
Beall-Ladymon (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi Kansas). Acquired in 1994, all stores converted to Stage.
Uhlman's (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio). Acquired in 1996. In addition to the Uhlman's name, Uhlman's operated Milliken's stores in Michigan. All were renamed Stage, except for a locations in Traverse City, Michigan, Cadillac, Michigan, and Manistee, Michigan which operated as Stage-Milliken until 2001.[6]
C. R. Anthony Co. (Montana, Idaho, Oregon, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Wyoming) Acquired 1997, most stores converted to Stage, while some Anthony's, such as those located in Amarillo, Texas, became Bealls locations.
Tri-North (Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington) Most of these locations operated as Hub Clothing Stores before the 1998 acquisition, when all 15 stores converted to Stage.
B. C. Moore & Sons, (Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina). Acquired February 2006. By November 2006, 69 of these 76 stores were converted to the Peebles name and format, and the other nine were closed.

How Safe Is Stage Stores Inc. Stock?
The stock could be a dividend trap.











                Jeremy Bowman
            

                (TMFHobo)



            
            Mar 23, 2016 at 1:30PM
            
            





The best way to understand Stage Stores (NYSE:SSI) may be to look at the stock's recent performance. 

SSI data by YCharts
Over the last five years, shares have fallen 53%, while the broad-market S&P 500 has gained 58% and the SPDR S&P Retail ETF has jumped 88%. The disparity only increases when shortening the window to 2013. In other words, the current picture for Stage Stores stock is not a pretty one. The stock sits at a five-year low, and the company has badly missed earnings estimates in its last three quarters. What gives?
The company seems to have the misfortune of operating in a struggling industry -- department store retail -- and owns stores in oil-rich parts of the country that have been affected by the slide in oil prices. In its recent earnings report, CEO Michael Glazer said, "Our holiday results were pressured by low oil prices, the devalued peso and record warm temperatures. Stores in the oil patch and along the Mexican border account for more than 40% of our sales, and the economic uncertainty in those areas negatively affected our comp sales by 240 basis points during the fourth quarter."

The Houston-based company is particularly vulnerable to oil sector weakness, as comparable sales fell 3.4% in the quarter and 2% in the year, leading to substantial declines in profit. For the year, free cash flow was also -$50 million, another warning sign as the company invests in its e-commerce platform and improving store appearance.
Like many of its rivals, the company plans to close  stores. Over the summer, Stage said it would shutter 90 of its 832 stores and plans to close 30 stores this year, while opening none. It forecast a decline in comparable sales of -3% to -1% for the current year and flat profit growth.
So how safe is it?The best reason for investing in Stage is probably its 7% dividend yield, a product of management's aggressive capital return policy, which also included repurchasing $41.2 million in stock, or approximately 20% of the company's market cap in the fourth quarter. While such a move will boost the company's per-share earnings, the business is not generating the cash flow necessary to pay for such a buyback, nor can it sustain the 7% dividend payout purely out of cash flow at its current profitability level.
If its performance continues to decline, the dividend could get cut or scrapped altogether, making Stage stock especially risky. With a track record of missed earnings estimates and declining comparable sales, and its correlation with oil prices, the stock cannot be considered safe. If oil prices turn around, shares could rebound, but otherwise its outlook seems bleak. The department store industry is struggling with the emergence of fast fashion and e-commerce, and the currency and commodity conditions that have weighed on Stage seem unlikely to change in the near future. Therefore, investors seeking a safe investment should look somewhere else.





A better bet in the department store industry may be J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP). The once-ailing chain is on its way back to profitability and posting strong comparable sales growth. The company has also beaten estimates solidly for the last four quarters, and that's a trend you want to get behind. 
The past year has seen Stage's shares shed more than 60% of their value, and it's clear why. For investors looking for safety, that should be a red flag.

Stage Stores, Inc. Revenue and Financial Data

   If the world is a stage, Stage Stores wants to dress the actors. The company operates about 885 department stores, mainly in rural towns in some 40 US states. (More than a quarter of the stores are in Texas.) Through its Peebles, Bealls, Stage, Palais Royal, and Goody's Family Clothing chains, the retailer offers small-town America moderately priced apparel and accessories, cosmetics, and footwear. Nationally recognized brands, such as Tommy Hilfiger, Carter's, Levi Strauss, Chaps, and Polo account for about 85% of sales and are sold alongside Stage Stores' private-label merchandise. Stage Stores is rapidly expanding its Goody's chain and sold its off-price 35-store Steele's chain (launched in 2011) in 2014.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
