Investment Process


		The linchpin of our process is our rigorous approach to risk management based on the fundamental tenet that preservation of capital is our first priority. We align our interests with those of our clients by investing our own capital alongside those we serve.

		Our investment process is anchored by four time-tested cornerstones:

Idea Generation

		We begin by using the breadth and depth of our industry-specific knowledge, alongside our many relationships to identify out-of-favor companies with potential catalysts for transformational change. Potential investment opportunities are found by using various value screens derived from our many years of sector specialization. Our search focuses on evaluating companies based on recurring revenues, strong cash flows, strategic importance, management team and balance sheet quality. This approach enables us to seek quality investments with attractive asymmetric risk/reward characteristics.

Independent Analysis

		Our bottom-up investment approach consists of several interlocking pieces of fundamental research and analysis. Each potential investment opportunity undergoes extensive analysis of the quality of its recurring revenue base, earnings power, financial condition, and valuation given the current and projected outlook. A strategic competitive analysis is performed to understand the company’s strengths and weaknesses, with potential catalysts/events that may unlock shareholder value identified. 

		We meet with management teams, board members, industry contacts and consultants throughout the research process and constantly reevaluate our analysis. Both the upside and downside return scenarios are modeled to fully understand the risks associated with the investment. 

Investment Discussion

		Each investment opportunity is scrutinized by the team, with a sharp focus on downside risk. We consistently ask the question, “How low can it go?”, and a “Devil’s Advocate” test is always performed to understand the risks. Optimal entry points are established after upside and downside risk targets are determined. Position sizing varies upon conviction level.

Position and Portfolio Management

		The portfolio is constantly monitored for developments that might create opportunistic trading. Comprehensive risk analysis is done that closely follows volatility, liquidity, industry exposure, incremental value at risk, correlation and beta. Diligent re-evaluations of each position can lead to adding, trimming, or exiting a stock depending on the fundamental change to the investment over time.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Stay far, far away from this nightmare of an experience from the website to the customer service line to the joke of a mobile app. Overdraft fees are insane at $37, sometimes more if they cover it.

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            Had accounts of fraud occur on two different Key Bank cards. There is definitely a malfunction in their chip technology. The first time it happened, the fraud dept. refused to get ATM security footage and instead accused my boyfriend of stealing the money from me. The second...show more

KingSize Credit Card


                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks. When you sign up it claims no annual fee, no monthly fees, etc. However now there is a minimum monthly payment even if you you have a zero balance. So I'm...show more
