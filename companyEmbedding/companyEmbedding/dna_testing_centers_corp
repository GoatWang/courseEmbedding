We will not receive proceeds from the sale of the shares by selling
shareholders.


We compete with other companies offering DNA testing products in Canada that are
similar to or substantially the same as the products offered by us. This may
put us at a competitive disadvantage since our tests are not unique. Our
competitors include www.thednalab.com, www.dnacanada.com, and www.easyDNA.ca.
Competitors for our over-the-counter ancestry testing kits include
dna.ancestry.com, www.accu-metrics.com and www.medcan.com.  

To compete, we plan to:

. develop a user friendly appealing website to sell our DNA testing kits 
  directly to consumers and medical practitioners in Canada;

. develop our slogans “DNA For Family” and “DNA For Health”;

. attract medical practitioners and their customers through the existing
  relationships of our chief executive officer, president and director, Dr.
  Barjinder Sohal, a licensed physician, and Dr. Nitan Arora, our vice president
  and director, a chiropractic physician; and

. implement our marketing plan that includes incentives for medical 
  practitioners, medical facilities and fitness centers that purchase our 
  products on a repeat basis.

The DNA testing and product market is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
Our ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside our control,
including the performance and reliability of our test kits, customer service, 
marketing efforts and development of our logs and brand name. Due to the 
relatively low barriers to entry in the DNA testing products market in Canada we
expect additional competition from other emerging companies. Many of our 
existing and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have
significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result,
they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies for DNA
testing products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete 
successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure
will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and 
financial condition.


Company Description
We are a development-stage company, incorporated in the State of Florida on July
3, 2014, to acquire our wholly owned subsidiary DNA Centers of Canada, Ltd, a
Canadian corporation formed on April 6, 2009, to distribute DNA diagnostic
testing kits to consumers and medical practitioners in


 Canada.
---

Our operations to date and those of our wholly owned subsidiary, DNA Testing
Centers of Canada, Ltd., include: (i) development of our business plan; (ii)
research and development of DNA testing methods and technologies; (iii) locating
suppliers for DNA testing kits; (iv) locating and reviewing potential labs to
interpret our DNA testing kits; (v) creating our marketing strategy; (vi)
developing content for our website that describes DNA technology, the DNA
testing process and the DNA test kits we sell; and (v) selling our DNA testing
kits to medical practitioners and directly to consumers. DNA Testing Centers of
Canada, Ltd., commenced sales of its products in April of 2010.
---

Our principal executive office is located at 2378 Parkhaven Boulevard, Oakville,
Ontario, L6H 0E7, Canada. Our telephone number is 1-866-863-5139. Our website
is www.dnatestingcanada.com.

With more than 35 years of experience, LabCorp is a trusted DNA testing laboratory for paternity testing.
Since 1981, LabCorp DNA has been delivering trusted results. With more than 2 million legal DNA tests performed, scientific and legal accuracy is our highest priority as we use the latest technologies available to give you the results you can rely on.
Order or schedule a paternity/maternity test on the LabCorp DNA Identity website.
 
 Legal Tests and At-Home Collection Kits
Legal Tests
 
DNA tests performed for use in a court case, such as child support or immigration, require a legal chain of custody and testing in an accredited laboratory.
Chain of custody is everything that happens to a sample from collection to submission for testing. This process is followed to ensure integrity of the sample throughout the process. Once the results of the legal DNA test are provided, they may be used as evidence wherever needed. Whether they are used in a state, tribal, or federal court, or for an adoption or immigration through the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS), the results may be viewed as valid and accurate when the chain of custody process has been followed.
LabCorp prides itself on the exacting attention it gives to your sample’s chain of custody. Visit the LabCorp DNA Identity website to learn more about the variety of legal DNA tests, including:


Paternity/Maternity Tests


Immigration and Surrogacy Tests


Adoption Tests


Tribal Enrollment


Estate Tests (Probate)


Kinship Tests


Twin Tests


Single Party Tests




Order a Legal Test

 At-Home DNA Collection Kits
 
At-home DNA collections are commonly called non-legal tests. They provide the same information as a legal DNA test, but they are not intended for use in a court of law. If you just want to know this information but do not need to use that information in a court case, you may wish to use at-home kits.
Visit the LabCorp DNA Identity website to learn about the different types of non-legal testing available, including:


Non-Legal Paternity/Maternity Kits


Twin Evaluation Kits


Single Party Kits

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Ancestry.com has received 3.73 out of 5 stars based on 90 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
