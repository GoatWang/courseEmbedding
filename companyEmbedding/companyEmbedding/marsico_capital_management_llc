A Message from Tom



Tom Marsico, Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Marsico Capital Management

From the day we opened our doors to investors in 1997 we at Marsico Capital have been singularly focused on one thing – stock picking. We are dedicated to generating strong long-term returns for our clients through a select set of concentrated growth equity portfolios.
We have consistently applied the same growth oriented investment philosophy since the inception of our firm. Our philosophy is rooted in the belief that, over time, investors can compound returns above the benchmark by investing in high quality companies that are gaining market share in large and addressable markets. Our uncompromising, hands-on research is a cornerstone of our investment process. When we find an investment idea that we like, we invest with conviction.
I, along with many others at Marsico Capital Management, invest in the Marsico Funds. We understand that performance and superior service are critical to our success and yours. As an independent asset manager, we are fiercely committed to fulfilling these goals.
I want to thank you for your interest in our firm and invite you to further explore our website or contact our Shareholder Services team to learn more about the Marsico Funds.
