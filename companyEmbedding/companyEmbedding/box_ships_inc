Corporate Profile - Overview



Company profile
Box Ships Inc. is an international shipping company specializing in the transportation of containers and the provision of commercial management services to shipping companies. We are focused on maximizing shareholder value by maximizing returns on our investments while at the same time ensuring our vessels adhere to the highest safety and environmental standards.
History
We are a Marshall Islands registered company that was formed in May 2010. Our business strategy is focused on building and maintaining enduring relationships with charterers and providing reliable seaborne transportation services at competitive cost. We seek to create shareholder value by acquiring and operating modern container vessels and employing them in "period time charter" contracts. Mr. Michael Bodouroglou, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has been active in shipping since 1976. Box Ships Inc. is fully committed to promoting openness, ethical conduct and integrity in all its dealings and has developed a 'code of business ethics and conduct' establishing rules and standards regarding behavior and performance.
LocationOur executive offices are located in Voula, Athens, Greece. The company was listed on NYSE on  April 14, 2011. On November 17, 2015, the company was delisted from NYSE and on November 18, 2015 commenced trading on OTCQX International under the symbol "TEUFF". On January 3, 2017, the company commenced trading on OTCQB Venture Market under the same symbol.
Mission Statement
"To be a carrier which our customers can rely on, always offering a first class service with integrity, professionalism and transparency."

ATHENS, Greece, June 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Box Ships Inc. (the "Company") reconvened its 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting"), in Voula, Greece, pursuant to a Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders dated April 19, 2017, which Annual Meeting was originally called to order on May 31, 2017 and adjourned. 
At the Annual Meeting, the following proposals, which are set forth in more detail in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and the Company's Proxy Statement sent to shareholders on or around April 21, 2017, were approved and adopted:









To elect one Class B Director and one Class C Director of the Company to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders; and 
To consider and vote upon a proposal to ratify the appointment of Deloitte Certified Public-Accountants S.A., as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017.

The Company adjourned the Annual Meeting without taking action on proposal 3, which was related to the approval of discretionary authority to the Company's board of directors to amend the Company's Articles of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split.  The decision to adjourn the meeting was made to provide additional time for shareholders to vote on this proposal.  As of June 22, 2017, there were approximately 47% of all issued and outstanding shares voting in favor of proposal 3, and approximately 17% of shares have not yet cast a vote on the proposal.  Because the proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, and given that a majority of shareholders who have already voted have voted to approve this proposal, the Company determined that it would be appropriate to adjourn the Annual Meeting in order to solicit additional votes on the proposal to grant discretionary authority to the board to effect a reverse stock split.
The Company encourages all shareholders to read the proxy statement dated April 19, 2017 and to submit a proxy indicating their vote on proposal 3 prior to the reconvened meeting. The record date for shareholders entitled to vote remains April 10, 2017. Shareholders who need proxy materials are encouraged to contact Alliance Advisors, the Company's proxy solicitor, at (877) 777-8133. Valid proxies submitted by the Company's shareholders prior to the June 23, 2017 meeting will continue to be valid for purposes of the reconvened meeting.
The Annual Meeting will reconvene at the premises of the Company at 15 Karamanli Ave. 166 73 Voula, Greece, on July 14, 2017, at 2:00 p.m. local time.

Box Ships Inc. Announces Delisting From NYSE And Trading On The OTCQX Market

Nov 17, 2015, 17:25 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Box Ships Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


ATHENS, Greece, Nov. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Box Ships Inc., or the "Company", a global shipping company specializing in the transportation of containers, today announced that the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, has notified the Company that the NYSE intends to apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the common stock of the Company, trading under the ticker TEU, from the NYSE.  The Company's preferred stock trading under the ticker TEU PR C will also be delisted from the NYSE. The NYSE also informed the Company that trading in the Company's common stock and preferred stock has been suspended following the close of business on November 17, 2015. The NYSE reached its decision to delist the Company's common stock and preferred stock pursuant to Section 802.01B of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual because the Company fell below the NYSE's continued listing standard requiring listed companies to maintain an average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of at least $15,000,000. 
The Company will continue to file periodic and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other federal securities laws.
The Company has commenced proceedings to have its common stock trade on the OTCQX Best Market, the highest tier of the U.S. over-the-counter market. The trading of the Company's common stock is expected to commence on OTCQX on November 18, 2015. 
In addition, the Company has applied to transfer the listing of its securities to the Nasdaq Capital Market upon satisfaction of the relevant listing requirements, including maintaining a minimum bid price for the Company's common shares.  Subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders, the Company intends to effect a reverse stock split in order to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market.
For additional up to date information on the Company, please go to our website at www.box-ships.com.  Information contained on the Company's website does not constitute a part of this press release.

BOX SHIPS INC Company Profile

   If the box fits, it ships. In this case, the box is a 20-foot shipping container and the ship is one of six ocean going containerships. Box Ships, which was formed in 2010 and went public in spring 2011, purchased its initial six vessels at the close of its IPO. Its relatively young fleet boasts a total capacity of more than 28,000 shipping containers. The vessels also have time remaining on contract charters ranging from 15 to 60 months. The company purchased its initial fleet from drybulk firm Paragon Shipping, which founded Box Ships and is owned by chairman, president, and CEO Michael Bodouroglou. Box Ship's operations are managed by ship management firm Allseas.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
