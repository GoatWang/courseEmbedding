Monteris Medical Receives IDE Approval from FDA to Evaluate NeuroBlatein In Patients Newly Diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme
Sep 8 16
Monteris Medical announced that U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to evaluate the NeuroBlate® System in patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). With this approval, Monteris will initiate the Feasibility Study on Laser Interstitial Thermal Ablation for the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed GBM (FLAG), an open-label, prospective study that will be conducted in five sites in the United States. The NeuroBlate System, a type of MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), is used by surgeons to destroy and coagulate soft tissue lesions in the brain. Monteris previously conducted an IDE approved study to evaluate the NeuroBlate System in patients with recurrent GBM and recently announced an additional IDE approval to evaluate the System in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. GBM is the most common and deadliest type of primary brain tumor. It occurs most commonly in adults between the ages of 45 and 70 years and it accounts for 52% of primary brain tumors, and about 17% of all brain tumors (including primary and metastatic). The 5-year relative survival rate for GBM ranges from 4-17% and decreases with age. FLAG is designed to characterize the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of the NeuroBlate System in combination with standard of care radiation and chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The study will enroll participants for whom a complete surgical resection is unsafe due to location, shape or size of the tumor. Overall survival, progression-free survival, patient quality of life and healthcare utilization will be assessed during the trial in 30 patients followed for up to 12 months after the procedure and subsequent radiation and chemotherapy. Monteris Medical expects to initiate FLAG in the fourth quarter of 2016.

PRESS RELEASE
Monteris Medical Raises $26.6 Million in Series C Financing to Further the Growth of the NeuroBlate® System
Funding will support continued investments in commercial growth and the innovation pipeline
June 01, 2017
PLYMOUTH, Minn.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Monteris Medical today announced the recent completion of a Series C financing, raising $26.6 million in new equity. Monteris Medical is a privately held leader in the market for minimally invasive, MRI-guided laser ablation systems for treating brain lesions. Monteris currently markets the NeuroBlate® System in the United States and Canada as a surgical tool that provides neurosurgeons an alternative to traditional craniotomies. The Series C financing was led by Versant Ventures and SightLine Partners, with strong participation from current investors Birchview Capital and BDC Capital’s Healthcare Venture Fund. 





Martin J. Emerson, Monteris President & CEO commented, “We were very pleased with the level of interest we received through our fund raising process. The success of this financing is a strong indication of the long-term value proposition that our current investors, as well as the new investors we were fortunate enough to attract, all see in the Monteris opportunity.” The financing will fund significant investments in R&D, clinical research, and commercial expansion.
“We are thrilled to be adding two high quality and successful medical technology investment firms like Versant Ventures and SightLine Partners to our investor base,” stated Jim Erickson, Monteris CFO. “These two firms bring a track record of adding real value to their portfolio companies,” Erickson added.
About Monteris® and the NeuroBlate® System
Monteris Medical is a privately held company that develops and markets innovative MRI-guided, laser-based systems for the ablation of brain lesions. The Monteris NeuroBlate® System, including the Mini-Bolt, is the only minimally invasive cranial access system that enables a robotic interface for the precise and safe delivery of laser energy. Since receiving FDA clearance in 2013, NeuroBlate has been used in more than 1200 patient procedures across more than 50 installed systems in the U.S. and Canada. The NeuroBlate® System is a tool (as opposed to a “treatment”) and is not intended to treat any specific disease. Physicians should use their clinical judgment and experience when deciding whether to use NeuroBlate®.

Brain tumor treatment laser ablation system / MRI-guided

                                                                    - NeuroBlate®                                                            






























        Characteristics    



Type of therapy: 
for brain tumor treatment


Control: 
MRI-guided




        Description    


The NeuroBlate® System by Monteris® Medical, Inc. enables MRI-Guided Neurosurgical Ablation. It is the only system which monitors ablation contours in 3-Dimensions and provides real time imaging to support the surgeon's clinical decisions. The NeuroBlate System employs diode laser energy, delivered via a gas-cooled, fiber-optic probe which allows surgeons to safely approach, and selectively ablate, soft tissue and lesions in the brain that may have been previously deemed inoperable. The NeuroBlate System provides a new level of Controlled Access, Contoured Ablation, and Confirmed Margins, offering physicians a "Ray of Light" and patients a "Ray of Hope".

The NeuroBlate System is a combination of hardware, software and disposable surgical devices used with an existing MRI scanner. The integration of these devices allows the neurosurgeon to precisely direct an MRI compatible, gas cooled laser probe to a desired target, administer laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) and monitor thermal dose using real time MRI thermometry data. At Monteris, we like to say "The System is the Solution".

the NeuroBlate directional laser is the preferred tool for contoured ablation of targets while sparing adjacent healthy tissue. The NeuroBlate diffusing laser is designed to provide fast, volumetric ablation in a concentric zone of hyperthermia.
