Sonder by MOTEK on vinyl.

Info
‘Sonder’ was released on October 2nd, 2013 with a release show at the Minardschouwburg in Ghent.
Every great passion ends in the infinite… Likewise, MOTEK are driven by instinct for sultry recollections of forgotten emotional states. Chaos, coincidence and stubbornness: Motek’s endless jam sessions result in combinations of melodies, rhythms and creative flaws. Recording and relistening them, MOTEK are able to reconstruct a few ‘holy’ moments into their songs. Their sound is crafted by effect-laden guitars wandering around needy bass and entrancing drums. On stage, MOTEK combine their music with images, imagery, and imagination. They are well-known for their particular approach to live concerts, interweaving songs and visuals into a vigorous performance.
Like Enola.be and nbhap mentioned before, ‘MOTEK is back’. Going back to their post rocking roots was their starting point, thus ‘Sonder’ contains six tracks of beautiful and intense post rock like you are used to from their earlier work.
Sonder means ‘the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own – populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness – an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.’ – source

You’re awake. Walking through the door. Everybody is ecstatic. Lights are shimmering off of the glimmering faces. Each one unknown. Each visage, new. Among it all, you feel a sense of connection. From where and why? You feel it’s not meant to be understood as it is simply innate. Within each smile is a presence of you. Of us all. A visage like a mirror. Inspiration, unknown and unbeknownst. Vicariously, you can see the world as whole. Together and always new. And you move on, as who? This is the impact of MOTEK’s new release, Sonder.
There is something to be said about the genre of “post-rock,” as it’s become known, but more importantly, instrumental music as a whole. MOTEK simply lays down this truth in an exemplary fashion. These guys hail from the country of Belgium and have grown up with what seems to be a very inquisitively relaxed state of mind. One where the world around them only needs to be taken as seriously as it must. One where appreciation is abundant. One where people are more interested in understanding each other than judging their first impression. Sonder makes that human connection. A constructive strength that makes the world feel like an exhilaratingly beautiful place to live. In times like 2013, it’s easy to be lost in the chaos that is abound. This record finds a way to control all of that and make you feel at peace. You’re at home. Interconnection is not a struggle but an everyday occurrence.
Sonder is simply miraculous in it’s undertaking. You will listen to this album and imagine many intricately thoughtful nights to create such an album when in reality it took these individuals two nights to carve out the majority of this sculpture. As a band, they found a wavelength and let pure, innate, and unorchestrated emotion take hold. Simply put, they let it pour out; as human beings who were built to expel this great music on the world.

A mathematical model for product selection strategies in a recommender system

            Wang, Hsiao-Fan; Wu, Cheng-Ting
        

            Electronic commerce (EC) has become an important support for business. EC is regarded as an efficient platform to bridge the gape between the suppliers and consumers, but how to make use of a huge amount of transaction data and identify potential customers on the internet remains a challenge for an EC company. In particular, to recommend proper products to customers, the preferences of the targeted customers need to be accurately specified and their preferences should be taken into account. This is not only to show the goodwill of the company, but also to retain the customer relation. This study aims to construct a recommender system by focusing on the on-line decision support module with respect to customers’ characteristics and supplier’s profits. For effective decision support, a mathematical model is developed so that the right product can be recommended to the right person with the best profit for the company. A numerical example is used to illustrate how this model works when both supplier’s and consumers’ desires are taken into consideration to achieve an optimal Win–Win Strategy for market expansion.

Anumerical example is used to illustrate how this model works when both supplier’s and consumers’desires are taken into consideration to achieve an optimal Win–Win Strategy for market expansion.Ó 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.1. IntroductionWith the developments of World-Wide-Web, Electronic com-merce (EC) has been increasingly used as a platform for online cus-tomers to perform different activities for their daily needs. Amongthose activities, on-line shopping has been a very successful appli-cation. Instead of the traditional on-spot shopping, EC providesalternative ways to get the information of products for purchasingthe desired products with the following properties of transparency(Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 2000):1. Price transparency: participators can learn about the nearly per-fect information on price variation from different regions or thesuppliers.2. Availability transparency: customer can get the information onwhich company has his desired service in hand.3. Supplier transparency: who else makes the product?4. Product transparency: it indicates whether there is an alterna-tive product.5. Process transparency: it implies that online customers can haveaccess not only to product information, product pricing andproduct availability; but also to order status, product careerinformation (Yang, Pan, Wang, & Xu, 2004).An EC company with the above ﬁve transparencies can be re-garded as a matured company. However, when an online customerfaces so much exposed information, it is difﬁcult for him/her inmaking a quick and effective decision (The Economist, 1997). Withthe competitive market and impatient online customers, the needof a customized decision support system is urgent and essential foran EC company so that by providing more helpful information forthe customers, the faster and more satisfactory can the decisionsbe made; the better the retaining opportunity can the companybe achieved with higher proﬁts.From an EC company’s perspective, the main problem is how toprovide the customers with appropriate goods from thousands ofavailable products. Many EC suppliers use the recommender sys-tems to help the companies ﬁnd out the preferences of the custom-ers; therefore the right products can be recommended to thetargeted customers (Schafer, Konstan, & Riedl, 1999). A well estab-lished recommender system can add values to an EC company inseveral ways. For instance, at ﬁrst, by a web browser, the custom-ers can retrieve the information they need easily; second, by sug-gesting additional products for the customers, the company canenhance the cross-selling; and third, by a well designed recom-mender system, the customers can purchase desirable goods in amore convenient and satisfactory way so that the customer’s loy-alty can be sustained.Schafer et al. have introduced a framework of a recommendersystem and divided it into three stages of the input proﬁles, recom-mending methods, and output results (Montaner, López, & Rosa,2003; Schafer, Konstan, & Riedl, 2001; Schafer et al., 1999). Thecustomer’s personal data and preferences are the inputs to the rec-ommender system. From the input data, the adopted recommend-ing method functions and selects the suitable products as anoutput to the customer. With this kind of structure, the methodthat makes use of the customer’s data for recommendation in the0957-4174/$ - see front matter Ó 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2008.09.006* Corresponding author.

Effective product pricing

November 1, 2006	By
		LP Gas


       
    



In today’s volatile energy market, the successful propane marketer must know how to effectively price propane. It’s one of the most important skills for any owner/manager to hone.



 Randall R. Doyle



Price determines the margin that has a significant impact on the bottom line. The 2 million-gallon marketer who earns an additional 5 cents per gallon increases the bottom line by $100,000, at least 40 percent of the profitability for most marketers that size.
A competitive price is crucial in the competition for the new customer. It also affects the consumer’s perception of “good value,” which is one of the Propane Education & Research Council’s five strategic elements for tracking propane’s effectiveness in the consumer market.
At a propane conference this past summer, I asked the marketers to rank the toughest marketing challenges they face. Here’s what they said:
1) How to price in a volatile market
2) How to price in a market of wide-ranging retail prices
3) Eroding customer loyalty and credit worthiness
4) Competition from electricity and other fuels
5) Finding employees that deliver value and service
6) Price wars
It’s not surprising that the marketers said it’s tough being effective at product pricing in today’s market. To help find the right pricing practices for your business, follow the practices of today’s most savvy and astute propane marketers:
More than ever, astute marketers are vigilant each day about pricing. They understand that the pricing practices of the past do not work in today’s market. They understand that current information on propane supply costs and per-gallon bobtail operating costs must be known. Many, however, don’t know those costs.
Savvy marketers are constantly in touch with their competitors’ pricing strategies, having an effective response to their low-ball, first-fill price. In addition, they ready themselves to set tanks in the dead of winter when their competitors’ quality customers become outraged that they are paying a 50 cents or more premium per gallon. Finally, their winter price hits that sweet spot of taking advantage of the margin updraft created by the premium priced marketers while being able to gain new quality customers on price.
The astute retailer markets propane as a utility. Their product offering blends a monthly budget pay program and a supply price cap. This offering helps the marketer’s cash flow, focuses the customer on the monthly energy cost and not the price per gallon, and protects the consumer from the turbulent energy market. Everyone wins with this arrangement.
Effective propane marketers know how to sell value ahead of price when a prospective customer calls.
“Seventy percent of new customers want value and only 30 percent are looking for the lowest price,” says Kirk Wright of Pro Image Communications, which designs marketing programs for the propane marketer. “Those marketers that know how to sell value will win that new value-minded customer 50 percent of the time. It’s these value-minded customers that will stay with the company for at least eight years and are not likely to leave on price alone.”
Price is just one aspect of effective marketing. A marketing program should be about building long-term customer relations. This is done by creating the perception of good value through excellent service. Marketers who deliver value improve their customer retention.
“Customers that are provided quality service will stay longer and will be loyal. I consistently see this principle at work,” says Wright.
Market research also shows that companies across all industries that achieve the “superior quality” position will command, on average, an 8 percent higher price than businesses that are perceived to have lower quality. For the propane marketer, this is about 15 cents per gallon.
“I also see this with my clients. They provide excellent service and as a result are able to command a higher price because they’ve earned it,” says Wright.
As each marketer creates that position with the consumer, the entire industry wins in its battle against competing fuels, especially electricity.
How is the propane industry doing in its battle to create the perception of good value with the consumer energy market? Not well. PERC’s most recent consumer education research reports that propane’s good value favorability score of 50 lags electricity’s score of 73. One year ago, the difference was only five points.
A major cause for the decline is high crude oil prices, which is beyond the marketer’s control. Thus, it’s more important than ever that marketers do well with the things in their control – the practices that consistently deliver quality service, build trust and build strong customer relations.
Each time the consumer comes in contact with the propane company, the perception is affected; a positive experience builds the perception while a bad experience erodes it. Let’s look at the six points of contact between the customer and the propane marketer:

Bobtail driver
Serviceman
Phone
Walk in traffic
Community involvement
Written communication, including statements and invoices

At the same propane conference last summer, the propane marketers ranked the bobtail driver and phone the top two in importance. Given this, there are several points to consider.
Bobtail drivers should be managed as important ambassadors of your company and the industry. Drivers must know that their role is more than delivering propane. They should be trained in customer service, be courteous and appear neat and professional. Driver performance feedback and bonus/recognition should include an element of customer service.
Practice effective phone skills, which is a unique and essential discipline in today’s marketplace. The most common interaction with the customer is by phone. There are plenty of cost-effective training programs on CD and on the Internet that can be added to your employee training program. Select and develop your employees, especially the CSR, on their ability to communicate, solve customer issues and market by phone.
Monthly statements should be easy to read and should send a positive message to the customer. Confusing statements erode customer trust and confidence.
Build a strong face-to-face relationship with the people in your community. Our rural American values tell us that people want to do business with people they know and respect. This is what distinguishes propane from electricity with the energy consumer. Capitalize on it.

Motek 2016 Review - World Industrial Reporter



















































World Industrial ReporterInnovation Delivered Daily  



 You are here: Home / Tradeshow Reports / Motek 2016 ReviewMotek 2016 Review
December 12, 2016
Motek 2016, the international trade fair for automation in production and assembly was held on October 10-13, 2016, in Stuttgart, Germany. It was held in conjunction with Bondexpo, an international fair for bonding technology.
This year the combined shows featured 1049 exhibitors from 29 countries spread across 730,000 square feet of floor space, and hosted over 35,434 visitors from 90 countries. The visitors represented engineers, production staff, and executives from automotive, machinery and equipment manufacturing, electrical and electronics, medical, solar production, industries, and metal and plastic processing companies.

Conference presentation themes highlighted the trend toward IIoT / Industrie 4.0 and the need for flexible manufacturing. Sessions included production and assembly automation, feed technology and material flow, streamlining through handling technology, and industrial handling.
According to Frank Saueressig, from Beckhoff Automation (Balingen Germany), “the visitors clearly realized that PC-based control provides the ideal basis for IoT and Industrie-4.0 concepts: Handling and assembly technology must accommodate the trend towards product variants and advancing individualization right on up to lot sizes of 1 to an ever-increasing extent. “
The next Motek and Bondexpo fairs will place in October 2017, again at the Stuttgart Exhibition Centre.
