Plastics Powerhouse

Already the largest private company in Indiana, Berry Plastics keeps growing. From acquisitions bringing new products to expansions bringing new employees, the $5 billion company fills your house — and car — with plastic


    	by Louis La Plante and Trisha Weber    	 / photos by Jordan Barclay		Share| 

Inside the newly renovated Berry Plastics building, Adam Unfried and Curt Begle show off one of the company’s many display roomsInside the newly renovated Berry Plastics headquarters is a Mini Cooper. The red convertible was lifted into the 90,000-square-foot building during the construction phase that finished in February 2011. The car has never been started. It doesn’t have gas in the tank. It doesn’t run. Its purpose for sitting two stories above the pavement inside the largest private company in Indiana: to serve as a prop in a faux garage. “Prop” seems appropriate. Curt Begle, the 6-foot-9-inch president of Berry’s rigid closed top division, jokes that his outstretched frame is longer than the tiny car. As he stands next to it, along with not-much-shorter colleague Adam Unfried, president of the rigid open top division, the car nearly seems like a toy. Yet, the Mini Cooper is real. It shines in one of Berry Plastic’s display rooms and represents a big concept.
Nearly one year ago, Berry Plastics unveiled the garage along with other exhibition rooms including a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and outdoor patio — all stocked with the proper household products just as a home would be. These rooms, designed by Hafer Associates, demonstrate to Berry’s clients what their products would look like in cabinets, on shelves, in the shower, or in their cars. The Mini Cooper’s interior showcases two thermoform drink cups — the kind served at fast food joints — a pack of gum, and an unopened box of snack crackers. Each is packaged in plastic.
The concept is from former CEO Ira Boots. Featured in the February/March 2008 issue of Evansville Business, the now retired Boots helped Berry grow from $4 million in annual net sales to more than $4 billion. He acquired 30 companies along the way. “Under Ira’s leadership,” says Jon Rich, Berry’s current CEO, “Berry grew from a small, Evansville-based, plastic molding company to a national leader in the packaging industry.” Although Rich’s plans for Berry focus on continuing that growth, to mimic Boots’ prosperity is a tall order. “No matter what I do, I’m not going to duplicate Ira’s success,” Rich said at the September meeting for the Growth Alliance for Greater Evansville, a business incubator. He’d have to make Berry a $4 trillion company.
Still, early in his position of heading Berry Plastics, Rich has made the company bigger again. In the early fall of 2011, company officials announced the acquisition of LINPAC Packaging Filmco for $19 million. The Ohio company, which was a subsidiary of a United Kingdom plastics giant, championed packer processing film (think of the plastic wrap surrounding meat sold in groceries). But the best proof of Berry’s growth resides on the corner of West Franklin and Oakley streets where the 90,000-square-foot expansion is a part of the world headquarters. Employees barely had time to sit down in their new offices by the time Rich announced in June 2011 that Berry Plastics would soon look for 120 new hires over the next three years. The customer service, finance, and general administration positions would add to Berry’s 16,000 employees worldwide. The corporation, says Rich, is “a classic American success story.”
From laundry detergent containers near the washer to lip balm tubes on nightstands, the number of Berry Plastics products has grown exponentially since 1967. Originally Imperial Plastics, the company received a name change when Florida-based citrus grower Jack Berry Sr. bought it in 1983. It since has developed into a leading manufacturer of injection-molded plastic packaging, thermoformed products, flexible films, and tapes and coatings and has earned an extremely diverse clientele. Berry Plastics’ largest client constitutes only 3 percent of the business.
Additional clients have created the need for more employees. That job announcement in June includes careers beginning with salaries between $30,000-$40,000 plus benefits. This declaration followed the 2009 expansion of the thermoforming operations, which brought 360 production-related jobs to Evansville.
Berry already had been leading the way with thermoforming since acquiring Chicago-based Landis Plastics in 2004. That acquisition, says Unfried, brought “state-of-the-art technologies which has allowed us to drive our organic growth while improving our financial performance. It is one of the fastest growing technologies and product lines in the country.”
Thermoforming, a manufacturing process using heat to mold a plastic sheet into a desired shape, allows Berry to create a super-sized cup designed to fit into any vehicle’s cup holders such as a Mini Cooper’s. Thus, Berry Plastics ended what Randy Hobson, the executive vice president of commercial development, says was the No. 1 complaint the fast food industry had against drink cups: easy spillage. The redesigned commodity costs fast food giants more to make, but it increased sales because super-sized cups universally fit — without spilling. “We are the largest supplier in that business today,” Hobson says. “A lot of the expansion in Berry has been in the thermoforming area. A big part of that was drink cups.”
Berry Plastics has made acquisitions that have led to national attention. Take, for example, the Kerr Group. The Pennsylvania-based company had just landed a new client, Target, the superstore with nearly 1,750 locations in 49 states, and in June 2004, Target executives pitched the idea to revamp the cylindrical prescription bottles almost universally used in pharmacies.
Their new bottle came from Deborah Adler, a onetime senior designer for famed New York-based design studio Milton Glaser. She recently had witnessed her grandmother suffer from an avoidable illness. She accidentally confused her pills with her husband’s medicine — and poor labeling and design were the culprits in her confusion.
Adler’s new bottles, known as ClearRx, showed promise, and once on the market in May 2005, her design earned praise. News outlets such as New York magazine dedicated pages to the new look. Consumer attention soon followed. They flocked to a prescription system consisting of a wide, flat label; six color-coded ID rings for each family member (purple is the most popular color); a patient information card; and a label magnifier.
One month after ClearRx’s debut, Berry Plastics acquired Kerr Group for $445 million. The purchase gave Berry nine more domestic facilities and a much bigger product line. “They brought with them a broad portfolio of products and customers,” says Begle, “that Berry had not been producing prior to that acquisition.” From closures to tubes, he says, the Kerr group brought more than ClearRx prescription bottles. Even so, it was that bottle that took the spotlight when, after five years on the market, it received the Design of the Decade award from the Industrial Designers Society of America.
Growth also comes from Berry Plastics’ team of designers dedicated to improving the function and aesthetics of plastic products. They generate ideas, test the potential products with focus groups, and review the results in a theater room filled with couches, chairs, tables, and a screen that movie theater owners would envy. There, they view tapes of consumers trying new products. The hope is to create an item ready for the market — and for Berry’s display rooms.
The design team’s work is why Evansville fourth-grade students, who take field trips to the manufacturing plant Downtown, scour their household kitchens for items made by Berry Plastics. To find a plastic product made by a different company is a rarity.
And their efforts lead to continued growth. In our 2008 story, Berry had 13,500 employees, ranked No. 107 of top private companies in the United States, and reached $3.1 billion in annual revenue. Today, the company has a workforce of 16,000, ranks No. 50 of top private companies, and boasted $5 billion in sales in 2010. Each year, Rich says, Berry has seen a 20 percent growth in sales and earnings, and in the past year of his leadership, two more companies, Rexam SBC and Filmco, have been added to the list of acquisitions. These moves “not only enhance our reach from a customer and product standpoint,” Hobson says, “but they also bring expertise, people, and technologies to the company.” Rich agrees. “The key to innovation,” he says, “is people.”

Riverhead firm purchased by Berry Global

By:  Joe Dowd 
June 30, 2017
Comments Off on Riverhead firm purchased by Berry Global



Adchem Corp., a Riverhead-based developer of high performance adhesive tape systems, has been purchased by Berry Global, which announced the acquisition in a letter to its customers Friday.
The combination of Berry Global and Adchem will “enhance our ability to service your specialty tape requirements with expanded technologies, product line extensions, and additional facilities,” said Curt Begle, president of engineered materials for Berry Global, Inc., in the letter. “The collective personnel of our organizations will continue to operate with a strong focus on operational excellence, superior customer service, and the delivery of quality product to support your needs.”
Begle described Adchem as “a leader in the development of high performance adhesive tape systems for the automotive, construction, electronics, graphic arts, medical and general tape markets.” Adchem will be combined with Berry’s Engineered Materials Division, Begle said.
A receptionist at Adchem’s Riverhead facility said no senior executives were available to comment on the letter or the merger.
According to its website, Adchem is a family-owned engineering and manufacturing company founded in 1965 and headquartered on a 54 acre campus in Riverhead. The company is led by Co-CEO’s John and Robert Pufahl and “employs 115 engineers, scientists, executives and highly trained and qualified production, research and development professionals,” according to the website.
The terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed. There was no indication about the future of Adchem’s current staff and leadership.
In the letter, Begle said the combined teams “will work diligently to ensure a smooth integration of our companies, and I would like to assure you that you will continue to receive the same high level of quality and customer service that you have received from Berry Global and Adchem in the past.”
According to the Berry website, the company began in Evansville, Ind. as Imperial Plastics in 1967 as an injection molding and, later, a container maker. It has since grown into a global, publicly traded company (NYSE; BERY). It is a manufacturer and marketer of plastic consumer packaging and engineered materials.
Near the close of Friday’s trading, Berry was listed at $57.16 a share, up about 1 percent for the day.
