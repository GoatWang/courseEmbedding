MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 10, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Whitebox Advisors, a $2+ billion investment advisor based in Minneapolis, announced today the launch of two alternative mutual funds - Whitebox Tactical Opportunities Fund (WBMAX), which is currently offered for investment, and Whitebox Enhanced Convertible Fund (WBNAX), which the manager expects to offer during the first quarter of 2012.
"Whitebox is excited to let individual investors capitalize on alternative strategies to which they might not otherwise have access," said Andrew Redleaf, CEO of Whitebox Advisors who will also manage the mutual funds.  "With Whitebox Mutual Funds, our firm will apply our leading expertise in idea-driven alternative asset management to products available with daily liquidity, regulatory oversight, and ease of investing, to retail investors." 
Whitebox Tactical Opportunities Fund harnesses the firm's robust research and investment infrastructure, and quantitative tools to identify and exploit mispricings, dislocations, and anomalies in and between markets and asset classes.  Whitebox Enhanced Convertible Fund will invest in attractive convertible securities that may be overlooked by the hedge fund because they pose difficulties for arbitrage, but make sense for a mutual fund investment. 
Whitebox Advisors will not create a new team of mutual fund investment professionals, but rather offers access to the way its top hedge fund managers allocate funds to a larger, diverse population of investors.
"Whitebox Mutual Funds will be managed by the same senior-level investment professionals who manage the hedge fund portfolios and our global heads of credit, event, and equity will manage the risk," said Mark Strefling, President of Whitebox Mutual Funds.  "With sophisticated investment tools and professionals, Whitebox Mutual Funds are designed to invest across strategies, asset classes, and capital structures, all of which truly differentiates us from other mutual funds."

Whitebox Mutual Funds adds Mike Coffey as Head of Mutual Fund Distribution

		  New hire to grow team and further develop Whitebox's mutual fund business
		

Apr 17, 2013, 15:01 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Whitebox Advisors 











 
















































 

 




















 


MINNEAPOLIS, April 17, 2013  /PRNewswire/ -- Today Whitebox Advisors, an asset management company based in Minneapolis with over $2 billion in AUM (2/28/2013), announced it hired Mike Coffey as Head of Distribution for the firm's mutual funds. 
Mr. Coffey will be responsible for raising Whitebox Mutual Funds assets, client services, as well as building its sales and marketing team.
"Mike has a great blend of entrepreneurial spirit and deep industry knowledge – both of which I believe define the core of Whitebox as a business," said Whitebox Founder and Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Redleaf. "We are evangelists for principle-driven investment. And one of those principles is that it is our duty—not our clients'—to identify the areas of greatest opportunity and least risk in securities markets at any given time. We believe that when mutual fund companies invest solely in standard asset classes they effectively abandon their customers to the whims of the market. We think that this is wrong."
Mr. Coffey joins Whitebox with nearly 20 years of sales and marketing experience. In his most recent role, Mr. Coffey served as Senior Vice President and Head of Third Party Distribution for New York Life/MainStay, where he oversaw sales and relationship management for the firm's mutual funds, annuities, and separately managed accounts. Prior to New York Life, Coffey served as Director at Blackrock, where he held a number of senior sales and management positions. In 2008, Mr. Coffey was named one of Investment News' "Top 10 Rising Stars" in mutual funds. In his early career, Mr. Coffey played for the Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Organization after four years of varsity baseball at the University of Notre Dame. 
"Whitebox offers an investment management worldview that is atypical and extremely refreshing in this space," said Coffey. "I am honored to join Whitebox Mutual Funds and support the effort to bring Whitebox's principles and sophisticated investment team to the broader market."
"We are very excited to have someone with Mike's background and experience to build upon the initial success of our mutual funds," said Whitebox Mutual Funds' President, Bruce Nordin. "This is a significant step forward for the future of the team and of these products."
Mr. Coffey will be based in Whitebox's Minneapolis, MN headquarters.

	Whitebox Advisors, LLC, a Minneapolis-based hedge fund manager, is making its first foray into products that are available to retail investors through the launch of two alternative mutual funds.

	The firm's Whitebox Tactical Opportunities Fund launched last month and is currently available for investment. Whitebox said that the new fund utilizes the quantitative and qualitative tools that the firm's professionals use daily to identify and exploit mispricings and dislocations in the market.

	The second new fund, Whitebox Enhanced Convertible Fund, is expected to open to the public sometime during this quarter. According to Whitebox, the fund will invest in convertible securities that may be overlooked by the hedge fund because they pose difficulties for arbitrage but are attractive for a mutual fund investment.

	"Whitebox is excited to let individual investors capitalize on alternative strategies to which they might not otherwise have access," CEO Andrew Redleaf said in a statement."With Whitebox Mutual Funds, our firm will apply our leading expertise in idea-driven alternative asset management to products available with daily liquidity, regulatory oversight, and ease of investing, to retail investors."

	Founded in 2000, Whitebox currently manages more than $2.3 billion and employs 65 professionals, according to its Web site. The firm won't hire a new team to manage its mutual funds; rather, Whitebox said that the new funds will allow individual investors to benefit from the expertise of its existing hedge fund managers.

	Mark Strefling, president of Whitebox Mutual Funds, on Thursday said that alternative mutual funds managed by skilled and experienced hedge fund managers are in great demand. "By responding with a high-quality alternative mutual fund product, we diversify our traditional hedge fund business and expand the number and scope of relationships with the firm," he said.

	The firm also launched a new Web site that contains additional information about the mutual funds.

	Last year, Whitebox launched a "research portal" in an effort to curate ideas on sound investment practices. It then announced a research contest through which it is offering a $25,000 prize to the author of the research paper that it determines could most significantly impact the "art and science of investment." Submissions are being accepted through January 15, and the winner will be announced sometime this spring.

Whitebox Advisors, a 15-year-old investment fund company in Minneapolis, next month will liquidate three poorly performing mutual funds that it started in 2012.
The three funds, under pressure by selling shareholders, amount to less than 10 percent of Whitebox’s total assets of $3.85 billion.


Whitebox operates chiefly as a private hedge fund investor that caters to affluent individual investors and institutional investors, such as pension funds.
Three years ago, it became one of the few hedge funds to try to develop products for Main Street, launching Whitebox Tactical Opportunities mutual fund with a mix of commodity futures, stocks and other securities. Chief Executive Andy Redleaf said at the time that he wanted the firm to provide investments for smaller investors.
That fund fell more than 20 percent in value this year and its assets have declined to $365 million from $1 billion since 2014. The much smaller Whitebox Market Neutral Equity fund and Whitebox Tactical Advantage fund also are down this year.
“People were redeeming” from the three funds, Whitebox spokeswoman Amara Kaiyalethe said. “Because of that, the concentration risk to the investors who remained was too high for our comfort. We didn’t want to get into a situation where we couldn’t meet redemption requests.”

The firm stopped taking orders for the funds earlier this month, she said.
Whitebox also said in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Jason Cross, head of equity investing, resigned from the firm after 14 years. He was succeeded by Paul Karos, who joined Whitebox in 2012 and who serves as portfolio manager of the Market Neutral Equity fund. Karos has 30-plus years of experience on Wall Street and previously worked as an analyst and equity executive at Piper Jaffray.
Whitebox, with about 100 employees in an office near Lake Calhoun, did well betting against the mortgage industry before it collapsed in 2008.
Redleaf, 57, a Yale-schooled mathematician, was one of a relative handful of investment managers who delivered huge profits to investors by, before the 2008 housing and credit crisis, shorting and hedging against stocks and portfolios of financial and mortgage companies. Redleaf had concluded many such firms were stuffed with risky mortgages that had little to no underwriting. The collapse of those assets fueled the broader economic crisis in late 2008 and 2009.
