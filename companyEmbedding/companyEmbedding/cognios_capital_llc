Cognios Capital Launches New Mutual Fund with Innovative Investment Approach | Business Wire
























































Cognios Capital Launches New Mutual Fund with Innovative Investment 
      Approach




Cognios Market Neutral Large Cap Fund Uses Long/Short Approach and 
      Proprietary ROTA/ROMETM Strategy to Deliver 
      Long-Term Performance against S&P 500






January 02, 2013 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cognios Capital, LLC today announced the launch of the Cognios 
      Market Neutral Large Cap Fund (COGMX & COGIX) – the firm’s inaugural 
      mutual fund with a goal to provide individuals and institutions with an 
      investment product previously reserved for hedge fund clients. The 
      investment strategy of the Fund aims to outperform the S&P 500 Index1 
      over time by purchasing and selling short large capitalization U.S. 
      equities through its proprietary ROTA/ROMETM valuation method.
    


      “In times of unpredictable and volatile markets, investors are seeking 
      long-term performance regardless of market conditions and a management 
      team they can trust,” said John Brandmeyer, chief executive officer of 
      Cognios Capital. “The goal of this new mutual fund is to give retail 
      investors access to a proprietary long/short equity strategy. Strategies 
      of this type have generally only been available to institutions and 
      wealthy individuals through hedge funds.”
    

      The Fund differs from traditional long-only mutual funds by employing 
      risk management techniques, such as the use of hedging through short 
      sales. This hedging strategy has the potential to limit the downside 
      risk of the portfolio, as well as the potential to generate alpha2 
      for the Fund. Additionally, the Fund is uniquely indexed to the S&P 500, 
      whereas most market neutral funds are indexed to treasury bills.
    

      “There is increasing demand from retail investors for expertise in 
      alternative investment management, particularly for investment options 
      that are liquid and less correlated to broader equity markets,” said Jon 
      Angrist, chief investment officer of Cognios Capital. “Our new 
      long/short mutual fund approach responds well to these demands and 
      offers a new strategy for retail investors to diversify their 
      portfolios.”
    

      The no-load Fund offers two classes of shares – an Investor Class 
      (COGMX) and an Institutional Class (COGIX). The minimum investment is 
      $1,000 for the Investor Class and $100,000 for the Institutional Class. 
      Investors generally may meet the minimum investment amount for the 
      Institutional Class by aggregating multiple accounts within the Fund, if 
      desired. There is no subsequent investment minimum. The Fund launched 
      with an initial $10m of seed capital from management.
    

A Unique Mindset in Investment Management


      Founded in 2008 as an independent alternative investment management 
      firm, Cognios Capital strives to change the way people think about the 
      investment industry by providing investor-friendly services and 
      investment strategies that aim to perform well, independent of broad 
      market conditions.
    

      In early 2012, this unique positioning attracted James E. Stowers III, 
      the former chairman and chief executive officer of American Century 
      Investments, who now serves as a Cognios Capital advisory board member.
    

      “Cognios Capital was born out of a client-centric mentality, based on 
      the premise that investors should receive long-term investment 
      performance, transparency and liquidity,” said Stowers. “I have always 
      believed in the Golden Rule, and at Cognios, we align our 
      interests with that of our clients in order to provide unbiased counsel 
      and responsive service.”
    

      Cognios Capital’s proprietary ROTA/ROMETM strategy is a 
      fundamental quantitative stock selection approach that focuses on a 
      company’s Return on Tangible Assets (“ROTA”) and Return on Market Value 
      of Equity (“ROME”). This strategy seeks to determine a company’s 
      intrinsic value and compare that value to the current market price of 
      its stock.
    

      "Our ROTA/ROME™ methodology uses time-tested metrics to buy great 
      companies at what we believe are great prices," said Brian Machtley, 
      executive vice president, head of research and portfolio management, and 
      co-founder of Cognios Capital. “In general, this approach can be 
      considered a value-based investment strategy, but it also incorporates 
      the premise that growth is an important component of assessing a stock’s 
      intrinsic value.”
    

      Prior to founding Cognios Capital, Machtley was a senior analyst at 
      Helzberg Angrist Capital, LLC, an associate portfolio manager at the 
      Discovery Group, a hedge fund, and an analyst at Houlihan Lokey.
    

      Co-manager of the Fund and chief investment officer of Cognios Capital, 
      Jonathan Angrist, previously held portfolio management positions at 
      Helzberg Angrist Capital, LLC and Buffalo Funds, and was a Principal 
      with Harvest Partners Inc., a private equity and leveraged buyout firm.

      outperformance or underperformance of the portfolio relative to the 
      stock market. Since the Fund has generally attempted to hedge out all of 
      the overall market’s returns on a Beta-adjusted basis through its short 
      positions, all of the Fund’s net return is expected to be solely the 
      Alpha generated by the portfolio managers, less all of the Fund’s fees 
      and expenses.


As with any mutual fund, there are risks to investing. The value of 
      the Fund’s assets will fluctuate as the equity market fluctuates, 
      although the Beta-adjusted market neutral focus of the Fund should 
      reduce the effect of general market fluctuations on the valuation of the 
      Fund as a whole. Utilization of leverage, such as borrowings and 
      shorting positions, involves certain risks to the Fund’s shareholders, 
      including potential for higher volatility of the net asset value (“NAV”) 
      of the Fund’s shares and the relatively greater effect of portfolio 
      holdings on the NAV of the shares. The Fund may not always be able to 
      close out a short position on favorable terms. Short sales involve the 
      risk that the Fund will incur a loss by subsequently buying a security 
      at a higher price than the price at which it sold the security short.


An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, 
      charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. To 
      obtain a prospectus containing this and other information, please call 
      1-855-254-6467. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
