Hardinge Inc. Announces Acquisition of Usach Technologies, Inc.
Hardinge Inc. Announces Acquisition of Usach Technologies, Inc. Addition of High Precision, U.S. Grinding Solution Manufacturer Broadens Product Line  ELMIRA, NY, December 21, 2012 — Hardinge Inc. (NASDAQ: HDNG), a leading international provider of advanced metal-cutting solutions, announced that it has acquired Usach Technologies, Inc., a privately held, American machine tool company and leading provider of high-precision, computer-controlled ID and OD grinding machines and grinding systems based in Elgin, Illinois.  “Hardinge is a world leader in grinding solutions and the acquisition of Usach Technologies strengthens and reinforces that position,” stated Richard L. Simons, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “This acquisition complements our strategy to maintain our competitive edge by continually advancing and enhancing our product portfolio. Importantly, Usach strengthens our reach into high profile OEM’s (original equipment manufacturers) in the U.S. and expands our opportunities in the highly diversified end markets we serve.”  Usach was founded in 1985 as an importer of machine tools. The company evolved to become a leading innovator, designer and manufacturer of high precision grinding solutions for complex grinding requirements. It also has its own proprietary programming system, the Usach Open Architecture System©, for standard and custom internal (ID), external (OD) and simultaneous grinding applications.  The ID grinding machines range from single spindle to four spindle versions with standard and specialty configurations. They are capable of grinding parts up to 40 inches in diameter and weighing up to 1,300 lbs. The OD grinding machines are being offered as single spindle, dual spindle, and four spindle versions for grinding wheel diameters up to 30 inches, part lengths of up to 200 inches, part weight of 3,500 lbs and larger, and 42 inch swing, all beyond the capacity of Hardinge’s current product offerings. Strengths of Usach are designing and configuring products specific to a customer’s unique requirements and in many cases, equipping the machines with fully automatic loading systems. They are known for the excellent pre- and post- sales support they provide to their customers. Usach will expand the product range of high precision grinding machines & systems of Hardinge offered under the Kellenberger, Jones & Shipman, Hauser, Tschudin and Tripet brands which currently provide high-precision universal, production, jig grinding, surface grinding and creepfeed products.  Usach Technologies’ revenue in 2012 is expected to be approximately $14 million, with an ending backlog of approximately $24 million. Hardinge expects the acquisition to be accretive in 2013. Mr. Simons concluded, “We are pleased that the owner, Giacomo Antonini, will stay on as President and General Manager of this wholly owned subsidiary of Hardinge, along with his strong and creative operating team. We believe together we can help Usach grow beyond its historical capacity by leveraging our global network of sales and service organizations as well as providing the financial strength of Hardinge to back up their commitment to their customers.”

Continue getting ROI from your Hardinge equipment with Hardinge's Critical Components Factory Rebuild Program  

All rebuilds have a full 6 month warranty from date of shipment
Rebuilt and manufactured in the same facility by the same people as new machines
All rebuilds leave here "completely reconditioned"
Over 120 years of combined experience in the rebuilds listed below

Manual Lathe Headstock Rebuild
The Hardinge DV, DSM, HC and HLV were the most famous manual lathes ever made by Hardinge.  Our headstock team has over 120 years of experience reconditioning and building new headstocks.  The headstock rebuild consists of replacing spindle, bearings, pulley, nut, front cap, gasket and collet key, as required.  To ensure the head goes out completely reconditioned, we grind the nose and collet seat.  This is one of our most common rebuilds! (Typical Turnaround - 7 working days based on available parts)
 
Hardinge T-42 Turret Rebuild
The original Hardinge T-42 machines were one of the best selling lathes ever made with thousands sold worldwide.  Many customers still enjoy these machines in their factory holding the same tolerances as the day they were first delivered.  Our turret rebuild program will have your turret functioning like new after we replace/repair the bearing seals, quad rings, gear box, couplings and more! (Typical Turnaround - 10 working days based on available parts)
 
HLV Manual Toolroom Lathe Tailstock Rebuild 
Another popular rebuild is the reconditioning of the HLV toolroom tailstock.  This repair is done right in our Elmira NY facility and consists of replacing the spindle, bearing, feed screw, nuts, key, spring and  handle. (Typical Turnaround - 7 working days based on available parts)
 
Hardinge CNC Collet Closer Rebuild
Hardinge rebuilds both our Hydraulic and Pneumatic collet closers to like new condition. Our team of experts will replace the O-Rings, Quad Rings, Seals & Pistons in to give you a collet closer that is ready to perform like new! (Typical Turnaround - 7 working days based on available parts)

                                     Hardinge workholding engineers have300 yearscombined workholding engineering experience. These hands (and intelligent minds) are ready to improve accuracies, reduce setup times, reduce costs, add flexibility to a machine, develop new workholding concepts and solve gripping problems.Before sinking hours into experimenting and creating a pile of scrap metal, the logical, fail-safe move would be to putyour frustrating gripping problems in the hands of experience, where the end result will be safe, accurate and reliable.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
