Western Asset Mortgage Defined Opportunity Fund Inc. Portfolio Composition As Of March 31, 2017






Business Wire




Apr 27, 2017 5:30 PM EDT













 


















































  Western Asset Mortgage Defined Opportunity Fund Inc. (NYSE:DMO) announces its portfolio composition as of March 31, 2017.  Investment Objectives: The Fund's primary investment objective is to provide current income. As a secondary investment objective, the Fund will seek capital appreciation.  Investment Strategy: The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in a diverse portfolio of mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") consisting primarily of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS").  Portfolio Composition*:             Asset Allocation                    RMBS        62.1%      Alt-A        22.8%      Sub-prime        15.2%      Prime        15.9%      Option ARM        7.7%      Agency         0.5%      CMBS        22.3%      Asset Backed         11.3%      High Yield Corporate Bonds        0.2%      Cash & Cash Equivalents        4.1%             Credit Quality Allocation **           AAA       0.8%     A       0.4%     BBB       1.0%     BB       11.6%     B       10.6%     CCC       23.8%     CC       9.7%     C       5.7%     D       8.9%     Not Rated       27.6%                        Average Life (years)       6.8      Effective Duration (years)       5.3      Average Coupon (%)         4.7            Portfolio Statistics:                  Inception Date       February 24, 2010      Inception Price       $20.00      Total Assets***       $321,255,341      Net Assets       $219,505,341      Loans****       31.67%      Preferred Shares****       0.00%      Reverse Repos****       0.00%            Market Price       $23.70      NAV       $21.02     (Daily NAV is available on market quotation systems using the symbol XDMOX.)            Distribution Rate       $0.2350 per share      Frequency        Monthly (Declared quarterly, paid monthly)                     *               Portfolio holdings and weightings are historical and are presented here for informational purposes only. They are subject to change at any time. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100%, if any, are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.     **          Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.     ***         The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund's use of borrowings; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund's portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. This value excludes the Fund's exposure to leverage indirectly through the Fund's investment in the Master Fund. The Fund does not intend to incur additional direct leverage at the Fund level to the extent that its existing direct leverage at the Fund level and its implicit leverage through its investment in the Master Fund exceeds 33 1/3% of the Fund's total assets.     ****         Percentages are based on total assets. If the Fund employs leverage, the Effective Duration is based on net assets.                    Western Asset Mortgage Defined Opportunity Fund Inc., a non-diversified, limited term, closed-end investment management company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "DMO", is advised by Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC ("LMPFA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc. ("Legg Mason"), and is sub-advised by Western Asset Management Company ("WAM"), an affiliate of the advisor.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing





All investments are subject to risks, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund’s investments are subject to liquidity risk, credit risk, inflation risk and interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the Fund’s fixed-income holdings. The Fund may invest in lower-rated high-yield bonds which are subject to greater credit risk (risk of default) than higher-rated obligations. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to additional risks, including prepayment risk, which can limit the potential gains in a declining interest rate environment. The Fund may invest in securities backed by subprime or distressed mortgages which involve a higher degree of risk and chance of loss. Leverage may result in greater volatility of NAV and the market price of common shares and increases a shareholder’s risk of loss. The Fund may make significant investments in derivative instruments. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. The Fund is not guaranteed by the U.S. government, the U.S. Treasury or any government agency.

Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price or NAV, and assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price or NAV, respectively. Prior to January 1, 2012, returns based on NAV assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.
 
Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
 
Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund’s NAV. 



























A NOTE ABOUT FEES & EXPENSES: Based on the Fund’s net assets of the common shares, as of the most recent Annual Report.
Management fees: Under the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an annual fee, paid monthly, as a portion of the Fund's average daily Managed Assets. “Managed Assets” are defined as net assets plus the amount of any borrowing, including loans from certain financial institutions and/or the issuance of debt securities (collectively, “Borrowings”), and assets attributable to any preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) that may be outstanding. Please see the fund’s Annual Report for more information on expenses.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS INFORMATION: Portfolio characteristics and holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. 

Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
 


Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

 Holdings 






Holdings









IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Distributions 






Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the performance section on this page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section below. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested.
