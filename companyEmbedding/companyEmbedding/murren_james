CEO James Murren turned around MGM Resorts and now wants to reverse the fortunes of Springfield

SPRINGFIELD - During the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, the future of MGM Resorts International was in serious doubt.
James J. Murren, the chairman and chief executive officer of MGM, remembers it as the worst time in his corporate life.
"It was an incredibly challenging time," Murren said. "It seemed the problems were too big for one company to withstand."

After leading a turnaround at MGM over the past several years, Murren is now focused  on another possible reclamation project - the city of Springfield and its struggling downtown.
MGM, the biggest casino operator on the Las Vegas strip, is planning a nearly $850 million casino resort on 14.5 acres in the South End neighborhood, an area ravaged by the tornado of June 1, 2011.
MGM is competing  with Wyomissing, Pa.-based Penn National Gaming, which is proposing an $807 million casino in the North End, including  properties owned by The Republican and the Peter Pan Bus Lines.
Mayor Domenic J. Sarno is negotiating agreements with both companies and intends to put one or both on the ballot for city voters.
MGM and Penn National are vying with two other companies for a single state casino license available in Western Massachusetts.  The Mohegan Sun has proposed a casino in Palmer and Hard Rock International wants to build a resort at the Eastern States Exposition in West Springfield. 
Murren, the son of lawyer, grew up in Fairfield, Conn. and graduated from Trinity College in Hartford in 1983.
He views Springfield as "a proud city pummeled by challenges over the decades," and a place where people are passionate and determined about the future.

Murren believes Springfield can engineer a revival. "It will," he said, "and we want to be part of that."
Murren said he feels MGM's planned casino could energize a largely demoralized area.
Back in 2008, when world financial markets collapsed and panic struck stock markets, MGM also could have been demoralized, he said.  At the time, the company was building the largest privately-financed construction project in the country - the $9 billion CityCenter Las Vegas.
It was bad timing for a project that relied on banks, and MGM's revenues began to fall during the crisis. Murren said he pulled every lever to manage costs and to give the company time to emerge from its revenue decline.
He cut projects, persuaded banks to restructure debt, laid off some 8,000 MGM employees, reduced benefits for other employees and revised terms with Dubai World, the company's financial partner on the CityCenter project.
Amid the recession, 60,000 people had applied for jobs at CityCenter, including most union positions. After some dicey moments, the project opened in December 2009.
People were hired over several months, he said, and, then, in one day, 10,000 people starting working at CityCenter, a 75-acre luxury complex that features the Aria Resort & Casino and a tram that connects to two other casinos operated by the company.

MGM is also sound financially again, Murren said. 
"We prevailed when a lot of people didn't think we would," he said. "We're proud of how we have recovered. The company is much, much stronger financially. We are growing again."
Revenues and profits have been improving over the last several quarters, according to Murren. The company finished last year on a strong note and is off to a strong start this year, he added.
While at the company, Murren led $15 billion worth of acquisitions at MGM, making it the largest gaming company in the world. The company, however, has $13.5 billion of debt on its books and $1.6 billion in cash.
During a boom in the casino industry, MGM, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, saw its stock skyrocket to about $85 in late 2007. When the financial crisis hit, the stock plummeted to less than $2 at its low in March of 2009. It now is hovering at around $13 after rising about 14 percent this year.
The company, which has about $9 billion in annual sales, operates 19 wholly owned resorts in Nevada, Detroit, and Mississippi, in addition to the MGM Macau resort and casino in China. MGM has about 62,000 employees.
When he was at Trinity College, Murren wanted to be an architect. He studied art history and urban planning - until one year he landed "a really good internship" at the old Connecticut Bank & Trust.
That led to a position in 1984 as a research assistant for Cyrus J. Lawrence in New York, which he said was a "great research firm" on Wall Street. Those were the days before the Internet when good equity research was at a premium in the market.
Cyrus Lawrence was later acquired by Morgan Grenfell, a merchant bank in the United Kingdom, which in turn was bought by Deutsche Bank Group.
Murren rose to managing director and director of equity research for Deutsche Bank, and ended up working on Wall Street for 14 years, many from an office in a Gothic-style building at 115 Broadway, overlooking the once-looming twin towers of the World Trade Center.
In 1998, he accepted a post as chief financial officer at MGM. He became chief operating officer in 2007 and then chairman and chief executive officer in 2008.
While working on Wall Street, Murren also met Heather Hay, who was group chief for global consumer products equity research at Merrill Lynch. Murren and Hay have now been married 22 years and they have two sons, ages 17 and 14.




James Murren speaks at a press conference in August at the MassMutual Center to announce the casino operator's plans for Springfield. As a college student, Murren traveled to the building in the early 1980s to see concerts when it was called the Springfield Civic Center.

Murren and his wife are both civic minded.
After the terrorist attacks of September 2001, Mrs. Murren retired in 2002 to help Murren's brother, Dr. John R. Murren, co-found the Nevada Cancer Institute, which opened in 2005. John Murren was a top lung cancer specialist at the Yale University Cancer Clinic for 16 years, and he was running the clinic at the time of his death. He died of melanoma three months after the Nevada clinic opened.
 "It was one of those sad, ironic twists," said James Murren about his brother's death.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid recognized Heather Hay's financial skills and appointed her in 2009 to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a 10-member federal commission created to study the causes of the financial crisis. The commission's report, issued in January 2011, was on the New York Times bestseller list for a while.
Murren said his wife now is studying to become an emergency medical technician.
"I'm not sure why," Murren said in a telephone interview. "She is looking at me, figuring she will use it someday."
Murren, who is 51, has a sense of humor. Asked his age, he said, "Too old."
He also has always loved art. It's no accident that CityCenter is home to a large public art collection, valued at more than $50 million.
Murren said he also wants to bring an artist's touch to the planned MGM Springfield.
He recalls  piling into an old car or beat-up Dodge Ramcharger during his college days to see concerts at the Springfield Civic Center. "I saw the Kinks," he said. "I know that. It was 1982"
The civic center is now the MassMutual Center, which was upgraded and expanded with $71 million in state bonds about eight years ago. 
MGM Springfield would include a pedestrian bridge to be connected to the MassMutual Center, owned by the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority.
MGM initially floated plans to locate a casino in Brimfield, about 30 miles east of Springfield. 
But, Murren said, every time he visited the region, he would stop in Springfield. He said he saw the opportunity to assemble properties in the city as a casino site, and the company dropped its plans for Brimfield and unveiled plans for Springfield last August.
"I really have found an awful lot to love about Springfield," he said, mentioning the architecture of Symphony Hall and several restaurants, including the Red Rose Pizzeria and Theodores' Blues Booze & BBQ, which he enjoys.
Murren said MGM's proposal calls for a different type of casino planned on land near Interstate 91. The casino resort will have 54 apartments, 20 shops and 10 restaurants, 85,000-square-feet of office space and a gaming floor, all in the vicinity of a public outdoor entertainment plaza, according to filings with the city by MGM.
The mixed-use resort, Murren said, will be "outward facing," to symbolize an historic city that is moving forward.

"It makes more sense for a city clawing its way back from a variety of challenges," said Murren, a man who knows a bit about "clawing back" in the business world.

Many scenes were filmed at Piz Gloria for the 1969 James Bond 007 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Piz Gloria is located on top of Schilthorn, a 2,970 metre high summit in the Bernese Oberland, Switzerland, above Mürren. It's Blofeld's clinical research institute, and Bond spends some time there, eventually destroying the whole place. In real life though, the Bond production team actually helped financing the completion of the unique revolving restaurant and the helicopter landing platform.Piz Gloria is well worth a visit. Not only is it a major Bond location, but as the longest aerial cableway in the Alps, the Schilthorn/Piz Gloria provides stunning panoramic views over Switzerland. Over 200 mountain peaks in a spectacular landscape are revealed as the world's first revolving mountaintop restaurant slowly turns. The revolving restaurant offers 400 seats, arranged on two revolving solar-powered platforms. You can enjoy the panoramic view from every seat. The legendary "Martini, shaken not stirred" can be tasted at the James Bond Bar. In the Touristorama extracts of On Her Majesty's Secret Service are shown. Or enjoy the special James Bond breakfast, served daily from 08.00 to 11.00 am.Reservation and information:Schilthornbahn AGHöheweg 2CH-3800 InterlakenTel. +41 33 82 60 007Fax +41 33 82 60 009info@schilthorn.chWhere to stayAn appropriate hotel to stay at during your visit of Mürren would be Hotel Jungfrau Mürren, which can be briefly seen in OHMSS, when Bond is picked up by Tracy in her car after he makes a call to London in the phone booth. (The hotel looks quite different today than in the film).Another good hotel would be the Hotel Schweizerhof in the city of Bern (which is about an hour drive away from Mürren). The exterior shot of the office of the Swiss lawyer Gumbold was filmed here. On one of the center top balconys (where it currently displays the name of the hotel "HOTEL SCHWEIZENHOF"), Bond receives the decoder machines via a crane. In this office, Bond learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London College of Arms' genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, attempting to claim the title 'Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp'.Links: Official Schilthorn WebsitePiz Gloria WebcamsPhotosFilming on Piz Gloria (dutch)

Well worth the trip.  After 42 years, and expecting disappointment, I was thrilled.  Amazing views, excellent food, and it really does sit right on top of an Alp.  Definitely going back to ski in the Winter and hike up in the Summer.  I suspect the walls of the extension were fake in the movie, hiding a skeleton that merely supported the helipad.  That section looks different from the movie now, and contains the room where there are displays about the movie and a video.  My wife, who went reluctantly, enthusiastically went back to partake of the James Bond breakfast buffet, and we added a spectacular sunrise over the Eiger to our list of experiences.  Take that first cable car and you might have the observation deck all to yourself like I did.

I have actually been to Piz Gloria, on my holiday at Interlaken. I could of spent so long there, even though it was a small area, 4 cable car rides to the top but it was definately worth it, £40 per person roughly. Whilst in switzerland i actually drove along the swiss pass, sean connery drove along during Goldfinger, chasing after tilly masterson.

Magnificent place.
007 spagetti and many more bond surprises.
Unbeatable 360 views from the decorated dining room. Needs a longer bridge and a helipad to match the Piz Gloria from the movie though.
The town below the Schilthorn is where there was the car chase with Tracy I believe.
Great!!

I was ski club of GB rep in Murren in 1985.  The restaurant at Piz Gloria was run by the hotel where I stayed, so I had permission to go up on the first cable car taking up provisions and have my breakfast,  then ski down to meet my guests in Murren. I was so lucky.  Surely the most spectacular scenery in the world.

One of the greatest places I visited in Europe, in the 80s, would love to go back. The restaurant is in a fantastic location atop the Schilthorn and the rides up are spectacular. The whole area is magnificent summer or winter. I still have pictures from Piz Gloria hanging in my bedroom of the Eiger, Eiger Glacier, Monch , Jungfraujoch and Jungfrau  and watch the Bond movie filmed there whenever its on TV. As a skier it helped motivate me to move to Colorado from New Jersey.

Early career[edit]
Jim Murren attended Roger Ludlowe High School in Fairfield, Conn., where he played football and baseball and was a member of the National Honor Society. Murren received his undergraduate degree at Trinity College, where he studied art history and urban studies and attended Caesari Barbieri Center in Rome, Italy. He joined the Wall Street firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence as a securities analyst, and earned the Chartered Financial Analyst certification in 1991. He was elected a member of the firm's Board of Directors, becoming the youngest member ever of the company's board. During his career on Wall Street he brought about a pivotal recapitalization of MGM Grand, Inc. in 1996, and served as a Managing Director and the Director of U.S. equity research for Deutsche Bank.
At MGM[edit]
In 1998, he moved to the corporate sector, joining MGM as CFO and member of its Board of Directors. In 1999, he became President, and was promoted to Chief Operating Officer in 2007; he became Chairman and CEO in December 2008, his 10th year at the company. Under his tenure, the company embarked upon an extremely successful decade of growth. Murren was the architect of $15 billion of acquisitions including Primadonna Resort & Casino in 1998, Mirage Resorts in 2000, and Mandalay Resort Group in 2005—acquisitions that helped transform MGM into the world's largest gaming company. He was repeatedly honored as the gaming and lodging industry’s top CFO by Institutional Investor magazine.[1]
In 2008-09, Murren led an extensive reorganization of the company, resulting in over $500 million of annual savings; this, together with a $3.8 billion financing effort, kept the company from failure during the early days of the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009.[2][3][4]
During Murren's tenure, MGM joined with Dubai World in the development of the Las Vegas Strip's CityCenter. When CityCenter opened in December 2009, it represented the largest single private development and the largest green project ever undertaken in the nation’s history[5][6] and America’s number one generator of new jobs during the Great Recession.[7] Senator Harry Reid said, "The Las Vegas community may never be able to express its appreciation adequately for all that Jim has done, but his hard work hasn't gone unnoticed. ... He is a leader of his generation in job creation, green investment and philanthropy."[8] Somer Hollingsworth, President and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority, called CityCenter "the most exciting and impactful project to open for the foreseeable future.”[9] Under Murren’s leadership, MGM broke ground on May 1, 2014, on another major project in Las Vegas: a privately financed, state-of-the-art, 20,000-seat arena that it is developing with sports and entertainment company AEG.[10]
Murren is chair of the American Gaming Association Board of Directors, the national trade association for the commercial gaming industry, and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Brookings Institution. In 2013, he was named Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Corporate Responsibility Officers Association, a professional society for corporate responsibility practitioners. He was named by President Obama to serve on the National Infrastructure Advisory Council.
He was recognized as Executive of the Year by Casino Journal in 2013.[11]
During 2011, according to Forbes, Murren's total remuneration from MGM was $9.9 million, including $2 million in salary.[12]
Other interests[edit]
Over the years, he has been a pioneer in the area of corporate diversity.[13] Among the company's management ranks, more than 38 percent are minorities and nearly 43 percent are women.[14] During Murren's tenure as Chairman & CEO, the company has continued to garner wide recognition for its leading diversity and inclusion initiatives, such as: 40 Best Companies for Diversity (Black Enterprise Magazine),[15] Top 10 Companies for Latinos (DiversityInc Magazine),[16] Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality (Human Rights Campaign Foundation),[17] Top 10 Regional Companies (DiversityInc),[18] Top 100 Companies for MBA Students (Universum Global),[19] and Top Corporation for Women’s Business Enterprises (Women's Business Enterprise National Council).[20] FORTUNE Magazine has named MGM Resorts one of the World’s Most Admired Companies.[21]
Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine, a publication which recognizes America's most socially responsible chief executives, named Murren a 2013 Responsible CEO of the Year Award winner. The annual awards are presented to CEOs across industries that clearly exceed standards in the areas of employee relations, environmental impact, human rights, philanthropy, and corporate responsibility practices.[22] In 2015, he was the recipient of the Distinguished Leader Award by the University of Massachusetts’ Isenberg School of Management.[23]
He founded the Nevada Cancer Institute and actively supports Trinity College, The Johns Hopkins University, the Fisher House Foundation for veterans and military families, and other non-profit organizations. He currently serves as an executive in residence at Johns Hopkins University's Carey Business School.

Early career[edit]
Jim Murren attended Roger Ludlowe High School in Fairfield, Conn., where he played football and baseball and was a member of the National Honor Society. Murren received his undergraduate degree at Trinity College, where he studied art history and urban studies and attended Caesari Barbieri Center in Rome, Italy. He joined the Wall Street firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence as a securities analyst, and earned the Chartered Financial Analyst certification in 1991. He was elected a member of the firm's Board of Directors, becoming the youngest member ever of the company's board. During his career on Wall Street he brought about a pivotal recapitalization of MGM Grand, Inc. in 1996, and served as a Managing Director and the Director of U.S. equity research for Deutsche Bank.
At MGM[edit]
In 1998, he moved to the corporate sector, joining MGM as CFO and member of its Board of Directors. In 1999, he became President, and was promoted to Chief Operating Officer in 2007; he became Chairman and CEO in December 2008, his 10th year at the company. Under his tenure, the company embarked upon an extremely successful decade of growth. Murren was the architect of $15 billion of acquisitions including Primadonna Resort & Casino in 1998, Mirage Resorts in 2000, and Mandalay Resort Group in 2005—acquisitions that helped transform MGM into the world's largest gaming company. He was repeatedly honored as the gaming and lodging industry’s top CFO by Institutional Investor magazine.[1]
In 2008-09, Murren led an extensive reorganization of the company, resulting in over $500 million of annual savings; this, together with a $3.8 billion financing effort, kept the company from failure during the early days of the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009.[2][3][4]
During Murren's tenure, MGM joined with Dubai World in the development of the Las Vegas Strip's CityCenter. When CityCenter opened in December 2009, it represented the largest single private development and the largest green project ever undertaken in the nation’s history[5][6] and America’s number one generator of new jobs during the Great Recession.[7] Senator Harry Reid said, "The Las Vegas community may never be able to express its appreciation adequately for all that Jim has done, but his hard work hasn't gone unnoticed. ... He is a leader of his generation in job creation, green investment and philanthropy."[8] Somer Hollingsworth, President and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority, called CityCenter "the most exciting and impactful project to open for the foreseeable future.”[9] Under Murren’s leadership, MGM broke ground on May 1, 2014, on another major project in Las Vegas: a privately financed, state-of-the-art, 20,000-seat arena that it is developing with sports and entertainment company AEG.[10]
Murren is chair of the American Gaming Association Board of Directors, the national trade association for the commercial gaming industry, and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Brookings Institution. In 2013, he was named Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Corporate Responsibility Officers Association, a professional society for corporate responsibility practitioners. He was named by President Obama to serve on the National Infrastructure Advisory Council.
He was recognized as Executive of the Year by Casino Journal in 2013.[11]
During 2011, according to Forbes, Murren's total remuneration from MGM was $9.9 million, including $2 million in salary.[12]
Other interests[edit]
Over the years, he has been a pioneer in the area of corporate diversity.[13] Among the company's management ranks, more than 38 percent are minorities and nearly 43 percent are women.[14] During Murren's tenure as Chairman & CEO, the company has continued to garner wide recognition for its leading diversity and inclusion initiatives, such as: 40 Best Companies for Diversity (Black Enterprise Magazine),[15] Top 10 Companies for Latinos (DiversityInc Magazine),[16] Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality (Human Rights Campaign Foundation),[17] Top 10 Regional Companies (DiversityInc),[18] Top 100 Companies for MBA Students (Universum Global),[19] and Top Corporation for Women’s Business Enterprises (Women's Business Enterprise National Council).[20] FORTUNE Magazine has named MGM Resorts one of the World’s Most Admired Companies.[21]
Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine, a publication which recognizes America's most socially responsible chief executives, named Murren a 2013 Responsible CEO of the Year Award winner. The annual awards are presented to CEOs across industries that clearly exceed standards in the areas of employee relations, environmental impact, human rights, philanthropy, and corporate responsibility practices.[22] In 2015, he was the recipient of the Distinguished Leader Award by the University of Massachusetts’ Isenberg School of Management.[23]
He founded the Nevada Cancer Institute and actively supports Trinity College, The Johns Hopkins University, the Fisher House Foundation for veterans and military families, and other non-profit organizations. He currently serves as an executive in residence at Johns Hopkins University's Carey Business School.

		Schilthorn (from Mürren)	    



Enjoy the mountains, real wilderness and a breathtaking view of the Bernese Oberland on Mount Schilthorn, which became famous around the world thanks to the James Bond film «On Her Majesty’s Secret Service». You can be up on the Schilthorn (2970 m) in just 32 minutes from Stechelberg (864 m). In our revolving restaurant, we can offer a large A-la-carte menu, our famous James Bond breakfast and the best view over Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau. You can also combine a trip up the Schilthorn with a walk through the panoramic spa resort of Mürren (with no cars), a trip on the funicular railway to the Allmendhubel and a visit to the Trümmelbach glacier waterfalls in Stechelberg.
