      Todd Pedersen, CEO of APX Group, commented, “We’re pleased with our 
      progress during the first quarter from both a financial and operational 
      perspective. We reported 17.8% year-over-year total revenues growth, and 
      at the same time increased our Adjusted EBITDA, while continuing to 
      invest in our technology and smart home capabilities. As planned, we 
      began the rollout of Vivint Flex Pay in partnership with Citizens Bank 
      during the first quarter and we announced on May 4, 2017, a retail 
      national partnership with Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) to offer our smart home 
      products and services in Best Buy stores.” Mr. Pedersen continued, 
      “While we have a lot of work ahead of us, we’re looking forward to a 
      successful 2017.”
    

Revenue and Subscriber Data


      APX Group reported total revenues of $205.4 million for the three month 
      period ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 17.8%, as compared to the 
      same period in 2016. The increase in total revenues of $31.1 million was 
      primarily driven through an increase in recurring and other revenue of 
      $29.5 million. Recurring and other revenue increased $21.4 million 
      year-over-year through an increase of approximately 133,000 Total 
      Subscribers, while higher ARPU drove $7.1 million of the recurring and 
      other revenue increase versus the same period in 2016.
    

      The Company added 39,292 net new smart home subscribers during the first 
      quarter of 2017. The Company’s inside sales channel increased 
      originations by 9.1% to 24,498 net new smart home subscribers in the 
      three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 
      2016. Average Revenue per New User for the three months ended March 31, 
      2017 increased by $5.98, from $62.01 to $67.99, compared to the same 
      period in 2016.

      APX Group CFO Mark Davies commented, “We had a two-fold focus during the 
      first quarter of 2017: First, drive improvements in our operating 
      metrics, which we did with strong revenue growth, in particular through 
      our inside sales channel, a reduction in our subscriber acquisition cost 
      multiple, a significant year-over-year increase in Average Revenue per 
      New User and an improvement in customer attrition. Second, execute on 
      our IT and infrastructure improvements related to an SAP enterprise 
      resource planning system implementation, and the process changes and 
      system buildouts to facilitate the launch of Vivint Flex Pay, both of 
      which had successful initial rollouts.” Mr. Davies added, “We also 
      successfully completed a $300 million aggregate principal amount bond 
      offering, which was met with strong investor reception. In summary, we 
      believe we’re off to a good start to the year.”
    

Costs and Expenses


      Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 increased by 23.1%, 
      from $58.0 million in the first quarter of 2016 to $71.4 million. The 
      $13.4 million increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an 
      increase of $7.4 million in personnel and related costs, $3.3 million of 
      equipment costs and $2.1 million for contracted services and information 
      technology costs to support the growth in the Total Subscribers. The 
      $3.3 million of equipment costs includes approximately $1.8 million of 
      equipment cost related to the upgrading of customers’ cellular radios 
      from 2G to 3G and certain other updates to their systems to support the 
      change in technology.
    

      Selling expenses, net of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, for 
      the first quarter of 2017, were $34.8 million compared to $28.9 million 
      for the same period in 2016. The 20.4% year-over-year increase in 
      selling expenses primarily attributable to $4.0 of personnel and related 
      costs, $0.8 million of lead generation costs associated with growth in 
      the inside sales new subscriber originations and $0.7 million in 
      information technology costs related to rolling out new iPads and credit 
      card reader devices for the direct-to-home sales representatives to use 
      with the Vivint Flex Pay program.
    

      General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses, net of allocations, for the 
      first quarter of 2017 were $38.9 million compared to $30.4 million for 
      the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase of $8.5 million 
      was primarily due to an increase of $3.6 million in personnel and 
      related costs, $1.2 million for marketing expenses, $0.7 million of 
      information technology costs and $0.7 million of bad debt expenses.
    

Adjusted EBITDA and Net Loss


      Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 grew by 12.3% to $115.4 
      million on a net loss of $82.6 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of 
      $102.8 million on a net loss of $45.1 million for the first quarter of 
      2016.
    

Recent Developments


Vivint Flex Pay Plan


      On January 3, 2017, we announced the introduction of the Vivint Flex Pay 
      program which is expected to be our primary sales and pricing model 
      going forward. Under the Vivint Flex Pay plan, we launched two new 
      financing programs: (1) a consumer financing program with Citizens Bank, 
      N.A., in the first quarter of 2017, offering qualified customers in the 
      United States an opportunity to finance the purchase of products and 
      related installation used in connection with Vivint’s smart home and 
      security services and (2) a retail installment contract program ("RIC") 
      funded by Vivint, with respect to the purchase of products and related 
      installation to certain customers who do not qualify to participate in 
      the Citizens Bank, N.A. consumer financing program, but qualify under 
      our historical underwriting criteria. We may also establish credit 
      programs either directly or through an affiliate or pursuant to an 
      agreement with a third party to provide installment loans or similar 
      products to customers that do not qualify to participate in the consumer 
      financing program. Alternatively, customers may purchase the products 
      and related installation at the outset of the service contract with cash 
      or credit card.
    

      With the Vivint Flex Pay plan, customers pay separately for the products 
      and related installation and our service offerings. Under the consumer 
      financing program, qualified customers are eligible for installment 
      loans provided by a third party financing provider of up to $4,000 for 
      either 42 or 60 months. In connection with the consumer financing 
      program, a subsidiary of ours entered into an agreement with Citizens 
      Bank, N.A. pursuant to which Citizens will be the exclusive provider of 
      installment loans under the consumer financing program for our customers 
      who are eligible for such loans. Pursuant to the agreement with 
      Citizens, we pay a monthly fee to Citizens based on the average daily 
      outstanding balance of the loans provided by Citizens and we share with 
      Citizens liability for credit losses, with Vivint being responsible for 
      approximately 5% to 100% of lost principal balances, depending on 
      factors specified in the agreement. The initial term of the agreement is 
      five years, subject to automatic, one-year renewals unless terminated by 
      either party in accordance with its terms. We are initially offering 
      RICs for 42 or 60 month terms to certain customers who do not qualify to 
      participate in the consumer financing program, but qualify under our 
      historical underwriting criteria, and may establish credit programs 
      either directly or through an affiliate or pursuant to an agreement with 
      a third party to provide installment loans or similar products to such 
      customers.
    

Additional 2022 Notes


      On February 1, 2017, APX issued and sold an additional $300.0 million 
      aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior secured notes due in 2022 at 
      a price of 108.250%. A portion of the proceeds from the offering of 
      these notes was used to redeem $300.0 million aggregate principal amount 
      of the Company’s existing 6.375% senior secured notes due in 2019 and 
      pay the related redemption premium, as well as to pay all fees and 
      expenses related thereto and any remaining proceeds will be used for 
      general corporate purposes.
    

Strategic Retail Partnership with Best Buy


      On May 4, 2017, we announced that we have entered into a strategic 
      partnership agreement with Best Buy Stores, L.P., in which the parties 
      will jointly market and sell smart home products and services. Under the 
      terms of the agreement, Best Buy will offer certain Vivint smart home 
      products and services in approximately 400 Best Buy retail stores on or 
      before the first anniversary date of the agreement, with a continuing 
      rollout to a significant number of additional Best Buy stores by the 
      second anniversary date of the Agreement expected. We expect that Best 
      Buy will begin offering Vivint’s products in services in these stores in 
      the second or third quarter of 2017. The agreement also contains certain 
      exclusivity conditions to which the parties are subject. We expect to 
      devote significant management attention as well as significant capital 
      and other resources to our partnership with Best Buy over the course of 
      the agreement. Historically, we have primarily originated subscribers 
      through our direct-to-home and inside sales channels. There is no 
      assurance that our retail partnership with Best Buy or other third-party 
      distribution arrangements will become a significant source of subscriber 
      originations or revenue for us. There is also no assurance that Best Buy 
      will continue to distribute our products and services after the 
      expiration or termination of the Best Buy agreement. If the Best Buy 
      agreement expires or is terminated, or if Best Buy otherwise ceases to 
      distribute our products and services, we may not be able to establish 
      alternative retail distribution channels for our products and services.

      As of March 31, 2017, the Company’s liquidity position on a consolidated 
      basis, defined as cash on hand, short-term marketable securities and

      facility, was approximately $319 million.
    

Certain Credit Statistics


      Our net leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of net debt to LTM Adjusted

      Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should 
      not put undue reliance on these statements which speak only as of this 
      date hereof. You should understand that the following important factors, 
      in addition to those discussed in “Risk Factors” in our most recent 
      annual report on Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the Securities 
      and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as such factors may be updated from 
      time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are available 
      on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov, 
      could affect our future results and could cause those results or other 
      outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our 
      forward-looking statements:
    


        risks of the smart home and security industry, including risks of and 
        publicity surrounding the sales, subscriber origination and retention 
        process;
      

        the highly competitive nature of the smart home and security industry 
        and product introductions and promotional activity by our competitors;
      

        litigation, complaints or adverse publicity;
      

        the impact of changes in consumer spending patterns, consumer 
        preferences, local, regional, and national economic conditions, crime, 
        weather, demographic trends and employee availability;
      

        adverse publicity and product liability claims;
      

        increases and/or decreases in utility and other energy costs, 
        increased costs related to utility or governmental requirements;
      

        cost increases or shortages in smart home and security technology 
        products or components;
      

        the introduction of unsuccessful new products and services;
      

        privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches, or the 
        loss of data; and
      

        the impact to our business, results of operations, financial 
        condition, regulatory compliance and customer experience of the Vivint 
        Flex Pay plan.
      


      In addition, the origination and retention of new subscribers will 
      depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, market 
      availability, subscriber interest, the availability of suitable 
      components, the negotiation of acceptable contract terms with 
      subscribers, local permitting, licensing and regulatory compliance, and 
      our ability to manage anticipated expansion and to hire, train and 
      retain personnel, the financial viability of subscribers and general 
      economic conditions.
    

      These and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from 
      those implied by the forward-looking statements in this press release 
      are more fully described in the “Risk Factors” section in our most

Certain Definitions


      Total Subscribers – The aggregate number of active smart home and 
      security subscribers at the end of a given period
    

      Monthly Revenue per User (“RPU”) – The recurring monthly revenue billed 
      to a smart home and security subscriber
    

      Total Revenue per User – The aggregate RPU billed for all smart home and 
      security subscribers
    

      Average RPU (“ARPU”) – The Total RPU divided by Total Subscribers
    

      Average Revenue per New User (“ARPNU”) – The aggregate RPU for new 
      subscribers originated during a period divided by the number of new 
      subscribers originated during such period
    

      Attrition – The aggregate number of canceled smart home and security 
      subscribers during a period divided by the monthly weighted average 
      number of total smart home and security subscribers for such period. 
      Subscribers are considered canceled when they terminate in accordance 
      with the terms of their contract, are terminated by us, or if payment 
      from such subscribers is deemed uncollectible (when at least four 
      monthly billings become past due). Sales of contracts to third parties, 
      and certain moves and takeovers are excluded from the attrition 
      calculation
    

      Net Subscriber Acquisition Costs – Defined as direct and indirect costs 
      to create a new smart home and security subscriber. These include 
      commissions, equipment, installation, marketing and other allocations 
      (G&A and overhead), less activation fees, installation fees and up sell 
      revenue. These costs also exclude residuals and long-term equity 
      expenses associated with the direct-to-home sales channel.
    

      Net Subscriber Acquisition Multiple – Defined as Net Subscriber 
      Acquisition Costs, divided by the number of net new subscribers 
      originated, and then divided by the ARPNU
    

      Adjusted EBITDA – Net Income (loss) before interest expense (net of 
      interest income), income and franchise taxes and depreciation and 
      amortization (including amortization of capitalized subscriber 
      acquisition costs), further adjusted to exclude the effects of certain 
      contract sales to third parties, non-capitalized subscriber acquisition 
      costs, stock-based compensation, and certain unusual, non-cash, 
      non-recurring and other items permitted in certain covenant calculations 
      under the indentures governing our notes and the credit agreement 
      governing our revolving credit facility.
    

      Last Quarter Annualized Adjusted EBITDA (“LQA Adjusted EBITDA”) – A 
      common industry measure used to reflect the step-function in earnings 
      during the sales season related to the subscribers generated from April 
      to August. LQA Adjusted EBITDA, calculated by multiplying Adjusted 
      EBITDA for the most recent fiscal quarter by 4, represents the ongoing 
      earnings power of Vivint’s current subscriber base and is potentially a 
      more relevant metric than LTM due to the recurring nature of the revenue 
      and expected earnings.
    

      Net Service Cost – Defined as total service costs, including monitoring, 
      customer service, field service and other allocations (G&A and overhead) 
      costs, less total service revenue divided by total service subscribers
    

      Net Service Margin – Defined as ARPU per subscriber less Net Service 
      Costs divided by ARPU
    

1 This earning release includes Adjusted EBITDA, a metric 
      that is not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting 
      Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). See the “Statement Regarding Non-GAAP 
      Financial Measures” section at the end of this earnings release for the 
      definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to its most directly 
      comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    

      This earnings release includes Adjusted EBITDA, which is a supplemental 
      measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, 
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
    

      “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) before interest 
      expense (net of interest income), income and franchise taxes and 
      depreciation and amortization (including amortization of capitalized 
      subscriber acquisition costs), further adjusted to exclude the effects 
      of certain contract sales to third parties, non-capitalized subscriber 
      acquisition costs, stock based compensation, and certain unusual, 
      non-cash, non-recurring and other items permitted in certain covenant 
      calculations under the indentures governing our notes and the credit 
      agreement governing our revolving credit facility.
    

      We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to 
      provide additional information to investors about the calculation of, 
      and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the indentures 
      governing our notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving 
      credit facility. We caution investors that amounts presented in 
      accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable 
      to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers 
      and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under 
      GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) 
      or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as 
      an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of

 Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (NYSE:SPLP) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

Item1.01.




Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.




Merger Agreement


On June 26, 2017, Steel Partners Holdings L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (Parent or Steel Partners),
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger
Agreement) with Handy Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (Merger Sub), and
Handy Harman Ltd., a Delaware corporation (the Company or
HNH), to which, among other things, Parent and Merger Sub
will make a tender offer (the Offer) to purchase any and
all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share (the Shares), of the Company not already owned
by Parent or any entity that is an affiliate of Parent, for 1.484
6.0% Series A preferred units, no par value (the Parent
Preferred Units), of Parent for each Share (the Offer
Price). SPH Group Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, beneficially owns approximately 70.0% of the outstanding
Shares.


to the Merger Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to
commence the Offer no later than 20 business days after the date
of the Merger Agreement. Merger Subs obligation to accept for
payment and Parents obligation to pay for Shares to the Offer is
subject to various conditions, including (a) a nonwaivable
condition that there be validly tendered and not withdrawn prior
to the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares that, when
added to the Shares already owned by Parent and its subsidiaries,
would represent at least a majority of all then outstanding
Shares, (b) a nonwaivable condition that there be validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer
that number of Shares that would represent at least a majority of
all then outstanding Shares not owned by Parent or any of its
affiliates, (c) the Parent Preferred Units issuable in the Offer
and the Merger (as defined below) have been authorized for
listing on the New York Stock Exchange, (d) Shares held by
stockholders that have properly exercised appraisal rights under
Delaware law do not exceed ten percent (10%) of the Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, and
(e) other customary conditions. There is no financing condition
to the obligations to consummate the Offer.


The Merger Agreement further provides that upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, following completion
of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company,
with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as
an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the
Merger). In the Merger, each outstanding Share (other than
Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Parent,
Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent, or held by
stockholders who are entitled to demand, and who properly demand,
appraisal rights under Delaware law), will be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price, without interest. The Merger is
subject to the following closing conditions: (i)Merger Sub having
accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer and (ii)there being in effect no law or
order which makes the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibits the
consummation of the Merger.


The Merger Agreement includes customary representations,
warranties and covenants of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub,
including, among other things, a covenant of the Company not to
solicit alternative transactions or to provide information or
enter into discussions in connection with alternative
transactions, subject to certain exceptions to allow the board of
directors of the Company to exercise its fiduciary duties. The
Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances,
including in connection with superior proposals as set forth
therein. If the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to enter
into an agreement for a superior proposal and in other specified
circumstances, the Company would be required to pay Parent a
$3,800,000 termination fee and its transaction expenses up to
$1,000,000.


The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete
and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full
text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as
Exhibit 2.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by
reference.



The Merger Agreement and the above description have been included
to provide investors and security holders with information
regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement. They are not
intended to provide any other factual information about the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates or stockholders. The representations, warranties and
covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for
purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; were
solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement;
and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties,
including being qualified by confidential disclosures made by
each contracting party to the other for the purposes of
allocating contractual risk between them that differ from those
applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on the
representations, warranties and covenants or any description
thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or
condition of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective subsidiaries, affiliates, businesses or stockholders.
Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations, warranties and covenants may change after the
date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or
may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by the Company
or Parent. Accordingly, investors should read the representations
and warranties in the Merger Agreement not in isolation but only

In addition to working together and with an ecosystem of independent third-party collaborators, the Flex and MAS partnership focuses on:

Developing new technologies: Collaborating on development of next-generation wearables and smart clothing, optimized through key innovations in technology, textiles and fabrics. 
Bringing new products to market: Collaborating on Sketch-to-Scale product development, beginning at the design stages, to provide apparel brands with a simplified development process for integration of next generation wearable technology. 
Streamlining processes: Improving supply chain efficiency for streamlined production, procurement and distribution. 
Mike Dennison, president of the Consumer Technologies Group at Flex, said, "In addition to being a leading innovator in textiles and apparel, MAS has been a valued partner on many previous wearables projects Flex has worked on, including the Lumo Run product, launching later this year. We are looking forward to further expanding our relationship, and collaborating on accelerating innovation in the wearables technology market."
Lumo Run is an example of 'smart clothing' that combines fashion, technology and function, with the potential to be 'every athlete's portable running coach.' The pending launch marks a collaborative initiative by Lumo Bodytech, MAS and Flex. The technology, based on sports biomechanics research on distance running done at Loughborough University in the UK, has already resulted in new knowledge about running technique, identifying key characteristics for ideal running form.
