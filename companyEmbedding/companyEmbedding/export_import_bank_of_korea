Overview[edit]
The bank was first established in 1976.[1] Its primary purpose is to support South Korea's export-led economy by providing loans, financing mega projects and thereby facilitating economic cooperation with other countries.[1]
Government funds[edit]
The bank manages the following government funds:

Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF): The EDCF evaluates and implements aid projects in developing countries.[2]
Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund (IKCF): The IKCF oversees an economic cooperation program with North Korea and serves as a clearing settlement bank with the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea.[2]

Aid programs[edit]
On January 6, 2013, the bank announced its decision to provide loans and credit guarantees worth US$917 million to entertainment and food firms over the next three years to promote the spread of the Korean Wave in foreign countries. A spokesman representing the bank told reporters that K-pop, Korean dramas, as well as traditional Korean cuisine have huge growth potential, and that exporters of such cultural content deserve more investment and financial support.[3]

Doing Business in Korea
At first glance, Korea appears to be "just like any other nation."  Its capital city, Seoul, is a modern, thriving metropolis with all of the latest technology the world has to offer.  All over Korea, you'll find first-class telecommunications, the requisite five-star hotels, Western restaurants, modern transport systems (including very efficient subway networks in Seoul and Busan), innovative architecture, and so forth. Nonetheless, it is still very Korean and it is imperative that any American doing business in Korea realizes that Seoul is not Los Angeles (even though the latter, in fact, has a sizeable Korean community).  Every year Korea becomes more and more modern, but it is important to recognize that modern does not equal Western.  Koreans will not expect you to be an expert on the nuances of their culture, but they will appreciate a show of interest in matters that are important to them.  Koreans generally appreciate a foreigner's effort in expressing a thank you (gam-sa-ham-ni-da) or a hello (an-yong-ha-say-yo) in the Korean language. 



Though Koreans have transitioned greatly into Western society, the traditional ways of thinking in many areas are still practiced.  Koreans have a great respect for the family and hierarchy.  Extended families (i.e., parents living with middle-aged married “children” and their grandchildren) are still commonplace, although this is rapidly changing.  Among the older generation, the father is the primary wage earner, while the mother stays at home.  Due to changing social mores and economic pressures, the necessity for families to have double incomes is rapidly growing in Korea.  Although fathers are the primary income earners, in the majority of cases, salaries are entrusted to their wives and most day-to-day consumption decisions are at the discretion of the female spouse.  US companies may wish to take into consideration these traditional family roles when marketing to Korean consumers. 
Even though there are incremental changes in Korean attitudes and women are making progress, women professionals at the highest levels are still very rare.  In Korean companies, the majority of working women, many with top university degrees, are still relegated to secretarial jobs, accounting or educational work. Many qualified women welcome the opportunity to work as a professional with a foreign company whose attitudes toward gender equality and professional respect and responsibility prevail. 
Koreans still have a great respect for anyone senior in age, and intuitively establish their hierarchical position relative to others based on age.  Indeed, one of the fundamental principles of the Korean language is based on the plethora of verb endings, which indicate the level of respect accorded to another person.  In addition, a man generally receives more respect in the business world than a woman, though foreign businesswomen (especially, non-Asian looking women) are accorded almost an equal amount of respect as foreign businessmen.  Single women generally receive less -respect than married women whose ties to their husband oftentimes establish their position in society.  The American businessperson, as a foreigner, is generally exempt from the above societal classification system, although one should be prepared to answer questions that Koreans may regard as common to establish societal hierarchy but which foreigners may regard as personal, such as questions about age and marital status. 
Americans should be ready to mix business with social life as the Koreans base their business relationships on personal ones.  The heavy drinking of the Korean alcohol, Soju, beer, scotch, or other liquor is commonplace in establishing a personal, business relationship.  Also commonplace is the "no-rae-bang" where a group of businesspeople go to an establishment to drink and sing along to a video machine playing music.  As most no-rae-bang machines come equipped with songs in English, a businessperson may want to be prepared to sing at least one song in order to gain social favor with their Korean counterpart.  Although not as common as the no-rae-bang, businessmen should also be aware of “room salons” where Korean women serve food and drink to their patrons. 
When doing business, Americans should be sensitive to Korea's historical relationship with Japan, which made a virtual colony of the Korean peninsula.  Because of the Japanese colonial period, Koreans have an emotionally intense reaction at times to things Japanese, though there is an admiration for Japanese business acumen.  A businessperson should show great respect towards Korean society.  Any comparative mention of Japan versus Korea, where Japan has the upper edge may harm a business deal. 
Korea still observes Confucian ethics based on strong ties to a group.  Whereas an American may think in individual terms, (i.e., what is in my best interest?), a Korean frequently thinks in group terms, (i.e., what is in the best interests of the group and how can I help to maintain harmony within the group?)  For this reason, the majority of Koreans are intensely patriotic, calling Korea by the term, "oo-ri-na-ra", ("our" country).  In order to close a deal when negotiating, the benefits for the group, whether for the company or country, should be emphasized. 
For Koreans, relationships are all important.  "Cold calls" don't work and introductions are crucial.  Koreans want to do business with people with whom they have formed a personal connection or whereby a mutual intermediary has made an introduction.  As alumni contacts are a major source of networking in Korea, a particularly well-connected Korean will have attended a prestigious Korean university such as Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Korea University or Ehwa Women’s University. 
The exchange of business cards is very important and a means by which Koreans learn about the name, position and status of the other person.  Koreans observe a very strict hierarchical code whereby Koreans will generally meet to discuss business with persons of the same, parallel rank.  Businesspersons should always have their (preferably bilingual) business cards ready and should treat the exchange of a Korean counterpart's card with respect. (It is a sign of respect to receive and present items with both hands, followed in business etiquette by passing and receiving a card with the right hand.  One should never give a card, or anything else for that matter, with the left hand as it shows disrespect).  For historical reasons, Chinese characters, which Koreans can generally understand, are regarded as more sophisticated.  As such, a business card written in Chinese characters can serve for a business trip to Korea, China, and Japan. 
Negotiating style is particularly important.  Koreans can prove subtle and effective negotiators, and a commitment to a rigid negotiating stance early on may work to the American's disadvantage.  Your offer may include the best price, technology and profit potential but still be turned down because the Korean customer does not like your style. 
An important point to keep in mind concerns the nature of reaching an agreement with a Korean firm.  Westerners attach great importance to a written contract that specifies each detail of the business relationship.  Koreans, on the other hand, value a contract as a loosely structured consensus statement that broadly defines what has been negotiated, but leaves sufficient room to permit flexibility and adjustment.  The Korean Government has attempted to address this dual perception by formulating "model" contracts for licensing technology and other arrangements.  Both parties must be assured that the obligations spelled out in a negotiated contract are fully understood. 
Most Koreans have three names.  These names usually follow the Chinese pattern of a surname followed by two given names.  In a Korean household, all brothers and sisters have the same last name and a common given name; the only distinguishing mark is the remaining given name.  In addressing Koreans, foreigners should observe the use of surnames (e.g., Mr. Kim; Ms. Lee), using formal titles if possible (e.g. Dr. Yoo; Director Song). The most common last names are Kim, Lee, and Park.  In the use of formal titles as appropriate, one should always be familiar with the complete name, including the two given names, for identification purposes, as there may be several Mr. Park's or Dr. Lee's in the same company and even the same work space.

Methods of Payment
The Korean financial system is frequently hard-pressed to meet the demand for financing and capital for international commercial transactions.  This is mainly attributed to banks holding BIS (Bank for International Settlement Reserves) capital adequacy ratios above the 10 percent required and to being stricter on loan requirements for SMEs and small businesses, given significant personal household debt.  Foreign companies in start-up operations with a Korean partner often need to invest financial resources for the joint venture, while their Korean partner makes in-kind investments, i.e., land or facilities, for their share of equity.  Joint-venture companies and foreign firms often work with branches of foreign banks for local-currency financing, although the branches of foreign banks control a small portion of available Korean Won. 
Sources of Korean Won financing have included domestic commercial banks, regional banks, and specialized banks, including the Korea Development Bank, the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, the Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK), and the Korea Housing Bank.
Korea’s major international banks offer services for all types of international trade payment methods.  When you engage in business activities with a customer overseas, knowing how to collect payment on an overseas sales transaction is the single most critical factor for SME business owners who aspire to expand their international business operations.  
Common overseas payment methods include:  
 Sight and deferred payment Letters of Credit (L/C),
 Documents against Acceptance (D/A) and Documents against Payment (D/P), and 
 Open Account Transactions.  
D/A and L/Cs are forms of extended credit in which the importer makes no payment for the goods until the date called for in the L/C.
D/P is similar to D/A except that the importer cannot clear the goods from customs prior to making payment.  In some cases an importer can clear goods prior to payment under a sight L/C.  L/C transactions generally follow standard international Uniform Customs and Practice (UCP) codes.  
CS Korea recommends that U.S. companies consider dealing on a confirmed L/C credit basis with new and even familiar customers.  A confirmed L/C through a U.S. bank is recommended because it prevents unwanted changes to the original L/C, and it places responsibility for collection on the banks rather than on the seller. Once a business relationship has strengthened over time, use of payment mechanisms other than L/Cs can be employed.  
For more extensive details on international payment methods, please see:  http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/eg_main_043221.asp.  For specifics on letters of credit and documentary collections, please see here http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/eg_main_043245.asp  and here http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/eg_main_043246.asp.  The complete Department of Commerce Export Finance Guide, which covers these and other aspects of international trade finance, can be downloaded here:  http://export.gov/tradefinanceguide/index.asp
To reduce risk of nonpayment, U.S. companies may also contact credit rating agencies, which can provide fee-based corporate information to evaluate the financial credibility of Korean companies. Dun & Bradstreet Korea (https://www.dnb.com/product/contract.htm), the Korea Investors Service (http://www.kisrating.com/eng/), and the Korean Information Service are known to provide fee-based credit rating services in Korea.  
CS Korea can provide valuable information, including a company’s credit standing, through our fee-based International Company Profile Service http://export.gov/southkorea/servicesforuscompanies/icp/index.asp. The Korean Commercial Arbitration Board http://www.kcab.or.kr/servlet/kcab_adm/memberauth/5000 and private collection agencies can provide arbitration and collection services.  KCAB's mediation staff can counsel on the arbitration procedure to suit both Korean and foreign companies' specific needs and assist in communication and negotiation.
Whatever payment terms are agreed upon, make sure they are understood by all parties and that your client, representative or contact signs a mutually agreed document.  Payment terms must be agreed to in advance.  It is rarely wise to sell on open account to a brand new customer.
Banking Systems
Korea’s financial system consists of banking and non-bank financial institutions.  The Financial Services Commission (FSC: http://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS: http://english.fss.or.kr/fss/en/main.jsp), its regulatory arm, are responsible for supervising and examining all banks, including specialized and government-owned banks, as well as securities and insurance companies.  The FSC and the FSS have played a key role in financial restructuring and has strengthened the regulatory and supervisory framework governing the entire financial sector.  
Financial Services and KORUS FTA
With the March 15, 2012, implementation of the KORUS FTA, the U.S. financial service industry can expect new and unprecedented access to the Korean market.  Financial service commitments outlined in the KORUS FTA are some of the most progressive commitments made with any U.S. trade partner to date. The Agreement locks in standards, regulations, and commitments that increase the transparency, predictability, and cost-efficiency for operating in the Korean financial services market.
Some of the financial service commitments inherent in this Agreement include: 
 Language allowing for cross-border data flow and giving U.S.-based “back-office” support to U.S. firms with operations in Korea.  This commitment has a two-year phase-in period, designed to identify, review, and modify data transfer practices to ensure protections in Korea that are no less stringent than those in the U.S. 
 Permitting U.S. financial institutions the ability to establish or acquire financial institutions in Korea and choose the corporate form that best meets their business needs 
 Encouraging Korea to implement several reforms that would contribute to the transparency of rules and procedures, including regional integration of data processing. 
Consult: http://www.uskoreacouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Financial-Services-and-the-U.S.-Korea-FTA.pdf.  
Foreign Exchange Controls
Korea has liberalized foreign exchange controls, in line with OECD benchmarks.  A foreign firm that invests under the terms of the Foreign Capital Promotion Act (FCPA:  http://legal.un.org/avl/pdf/ls/Shin_RelDocs.pdf) is permitted to remit a substantial portion of its profits, providing it submits an audited financial statement to its foreign exchange bank.
To withdraw capital, a stock valuation report issued by a recognized securities company or the Korean Appraisal Board must be presented.  Foreign companies not investing under the FCPA must repatriate funds through authorized foreign exchange banks after obtaining government approval.  Although Korea does not routinely limit the repatriation of funds, it reserves the right to do so in exceptional circumstances, such as in situations which may harm its international balance of payments, cause excessive fluctuations in interest or exchange rates, or threaten the stability of its domestic financial markets.  To date, the Korean government has had no instance of limiting repatriation for these reasons, even during and after the 1997-98 financial crisis.
The Bank of Korea has detailed information about foreign-exchange control policies in Korea.  Consult: http://eng.bok.or.kr/.
U.S. Banks & Local Correspondent Banks
For a list of major U.S. and Korean banks in Korea, consult:  http://export.gov/southkorea/usefullinks/majoruskoreanbanks/index.asp 
Project Financing
Project financing (PF) is designed to facilitate funding of large-scale projects. The concept was first introduced in Korea to finance a highway construction project between Seoul and the Incheon International Airport. The government's decision to introduce this financing technique was prompted by the need to boost domestic demand by stimulating investments in large-scale projects, including housing construction and social infrastructure facilities. 
Most of Korea’s social overhead capital (SOC) projects are funded through PF. PF is also used for the financing of private sector projects, to include real estate development and buy-outs of financially troubled companies. Several Korean and foreign banks provide PF and offer venture capital investment programs for social infrastructure projects, private projects and SMEs in Korea. These banks support companies through direct equity investments, although domestic companies generally have access to local funding, as well as to informal and secondary financial markets charging higher interest rates. Debentures are also used as a financing alternate, although slightly more expensive than bank financing. Finally, financing in the form of long-term debt is available from the Korea Development Bank (KDB), but generally for high priority industries.
In January 2015, the state-run Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) announced that it will provide a total of KRW 56 trillion (USD 51 billion) in loans/investment and KRW 24 trillion (USD 22 billion) in loan guarantees to finance industrial activities and international development projects involving Korean companies amid a diminishing quantitative easing trend in USA and continuous depreciation of JPY. It will first finance large projects overseas related to engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), and the amount would be KRW 27.5 trillion (USD 25 billion). The total financing support increased five percent from the USD 69 billion executed in the previous year. It also set aside KRW 26.5 trillion (USD 24 billion) for SMEs to promote shared growth between large and small enterprises and which is same amount compared with previous year.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
