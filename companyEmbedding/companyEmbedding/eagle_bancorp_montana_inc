Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The purpose of these charts is to discover long and short term change dynamics. When numbers are growing year after year in the annual statements chart, the business become stronger and stronger and this is a good sign.
Quarterly Data Chart can be used to do a short term analysis. It makes sense to pay attention to the quarterly dynamics and do not wait for the next yearly statement. We should be alerted if we see that quarterly numbers are going down.
You can check "Annual Financial Statements" and "Quarterly Financial Statements" sections for exact numbers and growth rates.

Liquidity Ratios





Current Ratio




 


            Current Ratio measures the ability to meet short term obligations. Generally accepted standard is 2 (current assets should be 2 times or 200% of current liabilities).
        




Quick Ratio




 


            Measures immediate liquidity or the cash available to cover immediate liabilities. A safe margin would be at least 1 (100%).
        




Financial Leverage




 


            Defined as total assets divided by total shareholders' equity. The higher the ratio, the more debt a company uses in its capital structure.
        




Profitability Ratios

ROE




 


            Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of profitability that calculates how many dollars of profit a company generates with each dollar of shareholders equity.
            ROE is sometimes called "return on net worth."
        




ROIC




 


            The Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measure gives a sense of how well a company is using its money to generate returns. Some investors use this figure as a final evaluation to determine whether or not to invest in a company.
