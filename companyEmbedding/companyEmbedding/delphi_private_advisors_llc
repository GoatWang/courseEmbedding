                   divided by the total MV of the fund.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Institutional-caliber wealth management
Using a transparent and collaborative approach, Delphi strives to provide clarity and peace of mind in an unpredictable world.




Our services are driven by thoughtful excellence
Providing institutional-caliber wealth management services, Delphi works to create thoughtfully designed and managed portfolios. Delphi also emphasizes tax efficiency and risk-adjusted returns, in an effort to help you preserve the wealth you’ve worked so hard to build. Read on to learn more about our integrated, transparent and collaborative process.



Assessment
Our assessment process is based on two premises: listening and understanding. Sitting down with you and your family, our team works to understand your unique wealth management needs: What are your plans and goals? What are the risks and opportunities most relevant to you? How is your current portfolio performing?
Taking a comprehensive inventory of your financial landscape, we strive to identify what is and isn’t working. And rather than selling you products, we listen, learning whether or not we can be helpful. If we’re not the best fit, we say so. And if we agree to work together, we promise to continue listening, even after the initial assessment process.




Planning
After understanding where you are now and where you’d like to go, we map your family’s goals to a customized investment strategy. Our planning process helps you understand the risks and trade-offs of different approaches so, working together, we can make the best decisions for you and your family.
We put our extensive knowledge of capital markets, asset allocation, financial modeling and investing to work for you, building a personalized strategy that helps you accomplish your family’s short and long-term goals. And even as we move on to management and coordination, we’re constantly re-assessing and refining, working to secure your family’s future.



Management
Once we’ve created your investment strategy, we begin the meticulous work of constructing and managing your personalized portfolio. Our focus on tax efficiency combined with our disciplined methodology allows us to give you a tax-aware investment solution that also controls risk through systematic and thoughtful rebalancing.
You’ll have 24-7 access to your accounts through our sophisticated online reporting system. Unlike typical investment reports, ours are clear and concise, telling a complete story in a short, easy to digest format. Moreover, our reports tell you the honest truth about what’s happening with your investments. Identifying issues as they arise, we communicate with you and your other advisors to constantly optimize your investment strategy.




Coordination
Understanding that we’re part of a larger tax, legal and estate-planning framework, we work collaboratively with the rest of your advisory team. Whether you need us to take a central role in coordination, or work under another advisor’s lead, we’ll help ensure everyone has the information needed to manage your wealth.
Decisions made about your portfolio don’t happen in a vacuum, and lack of coordination can create a big impact on your lifestyle, charitable goals and family legacy. We’re committed to being excellent members of your advisory team, remaining available, when requested, to coordinate with your banking, legal, insurance and tax advisors.
