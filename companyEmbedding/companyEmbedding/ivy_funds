Ivy Funds Introduces Asset Strategy New Opportunities Fund






Business Wire




May 3, 2010 6:59 AM EDT













 


















































  Ivy Funds, among the first to offer a flexible portfolio fund 15 years ago, today announced a complement to its original Asset Strategy Fund with a new go-anywhere, asset allocation product that focuses its equity allocation on small- and mid-cap companies from around the globe.  The Ivy Asset Strategy New Opportunities Fund, effective May 3, provides a way for investors to access investment ideas that the Asset Strategy team is finding in smaller companies and industries in various parts of the world.  “Ivy Asset Strategy New Opportunities Fund extends the Asset Strategy approach to include smaller, high growth companies, especially in emerging and frontier markets,” said Michael L. Avery, Chief Investment Officer of Ivy Investment Management Company and co-portfolio manager of the Ivy Asset Strategy Fund. “For investors, the new fund is a complement to the larger Ivy Asset Strategy Fund, which typically focuses on large-cap equities within its broader, go-anywhere strategy.”  The new fund brings a strong tradition of innovative thinking, risk management and global perspective to its portfolio. It is managed by Jonas Krumplys, CFA, who has been an assistant portfolio manager on the larger Ivy Asset Strategy Fund for the last two years and has been with the Ivy Funds organization for six years. He has more than 20 years of industry experience. Krumplys, as part of the overall Asset Strategy team, works closely with Avery and Ryan Caldwell, who co-manage the larger fund.  The combination of the Ivy Asset Strategy Fund and Ivy Asset Strategy New Opportunities Fund may provide investors with broad, global equity market coverage, with the flexibility and responsiveness to manage risk while capturing opportunity, according to Ivy Funds executives.  The Ivy Asset Strategy New Opportunities Fund will invest its equity allocation primarily in companies within the small- to mid-cap range (capitalizations within the range of $0.5 billion to $10 billion). By virtue of its smaller asset base, Ivy Asset Strategy New Opportunities Fund looks to realize greater benefit on the margin from positions in these smaller, high-growth firms.

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk factors. The value of the Fund’s shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. The Fund may allocate from 0 to 100% of its assets between stocks, bonds and short-term instruments of issuers around the globe, as well as investments in precious metals and investments with exposure to various foreign securities. International investing involves additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political or economic conditions affecting the foreign country, and differences in accounting standards and foreign regulations. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Fixed-income securities are subject to interest-rate risk and, as such, the net asset value of the Fund may fall as interest rates rise. Investing in high-income securities may carry a greater risk of nonpayment of interest or principal than higher-rated bonds. The Fund may focus its investments in certain regions or industries, thereby increasing its potential vulnerability to market volatility. The Fund may seek to hedge market risk on various securities, increase exposure to various markets, manage exposure to various foreign currencies, precious metals and various markets, and seek to hedge certain event risks on positions held by the Fund via the use of derivative instruments. Such investments involve additional risks, as the fluctuations in the values of the derivatives may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets or with the underlying asset from which the derivative’s value is derived. Investing in commodities is generally considered speculative because of the significant potential for investment loss due to cyclical economic conditions, sudden political events, and adverse international monetary policies. Markets for commodities are likely to be volatile and the Fund may pay more to store and accurately value its commodity holdings than it does with the Fund’s other holdings. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.
Index Description: S&P 500 - An unmanaged index of common stocks. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Index Description: The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury Bills: 1-3 Month Index - Includes all publicly issued zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Bills that have a remaining maturity of less than 3 months and more than 1 month, are rated investment grade, and have $250 million or more of outstanding face value. In addition, the securities are denominated in U.S. dollars and are fixed rate and non-convertible. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Index Description: The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond TR USD Index - A market capitalization-weighted index, representing most U.S. traded investment grade bonds. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
30-Day SEC Yield: is calculated based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

An investment in a money market fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency. Although money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Please remember that an investment in a mutual fund involves risk. Investment return and principal value of a mutual fund investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Estimate the value of the funds and impact of fees and expenses on your investment.
30-Day SEC Yield: is calculated based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time.
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV.
Lipper Rankings are based on average annual total returns not including sales charge for the periods indicated. Ranking is for the share class specified; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Under no circumstances does information constitute a recommendation to buy or sell mutual funds. Lipper undertakes no responsibility for updating the calculations more frequently than monthly to incorporate more current data.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.



Class A share performance, including sales charges, reflects the maximum applicable front-end sales load of 5.75 percent, except Municipal Bond, and Municipal High Income, which have a 4.25 percent maximum sales load, and Limited-Term Bond, which has a 2.5 percent maximum sales load.
Class B share performance, including sales charges, reflects the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which declines from 5 percent beginning at the time of purchase to zero at the beginning of the seventh year.
For Class C shares, a 1 percent CDSC applies to the lesser of amount invested or redemption value of shares redeemed within twelve months after the purchase date.
Class Y shares are not subject to sales charges. Performance at net asset value (NAV) does not include the effect of sales charges.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk factors. The value of the Fund’s shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. The Fund may allocate from 0 to 100% of its assets between stocks, bonds and short-term instruments of issuers around the globe, as well as investments in precious metals and investments with exposure to various foreign securities. International investing involves additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political or economic conditions affecting the foreign country, and differences in accounting standards and foreign regulations. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Fixed-income securities are subject to interest-rate risk and, as such, the net asset value of the Fund may fall as interest rates rise. Investing in high-income securities may carry a greater risk of nonpayment of interest or principal than higher-rated bonds. The Fund may focus its investments in certain regions or industries, thereby increasing its potential vulnerability to market volatility. The Fund may seek to hedge market risk on various securities, increase exposure to various markets, manage exposure to various foreign currencies, precious metals and various markets, and seek to hedge certain event risks on positions held by the Fund via the use of derivative instruments. Such investments involve additional risks, as the fluctuations in the values of the derivatives may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets or with the underlying asset from which the derivative’s value is derived. Investing in commodities is generally considered speculative because of the significant potential for investment loss due to cyclical economic conditions, sudden political events, and adverse international monetary policies. Markets for commodities are likely to be volatile and the Fund may pay more to store and accurately value its commodity holdings than it does with the Fund’s other holdings. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.

In addition, the securities are denominated in U.S. dollars and are fixed rate and non-convertible. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Index Description: The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond TR USD Index - A market capitalization-weighted index, representing most U.S. traded investment grade bonds. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through July 31, 2017, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Fund’s investment manager, Ivy Distributor, Inc. (IDI), the Fund’s Distributor, and/or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and/or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses for the Fund’s Class E shares at 1.00%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by IICO, IDI, WISC or the Board of TrusteesThrough July 31, 2017, IDI and/or WISC have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient 12b-1 and/or shareholder servicing fees to ensure that the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses of the Class Y shares do not exceed the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses of the Class A shares, as calculated at the end of each month. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by IDI, WISC or the Board of Trustees.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
30-Day SEC Yield: is calculated based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Not long ago, coal provided 98% of the electricity for the pulp-and-paper mills and iron-ore producers around the western edge of Lake Superior, as well as the nearby city of Duluth, Minn.

Ivy Funds Broadens Global Product Line With Income Allocation Change and Equity Fund Addition | Business Wire
























































Ivy Funds Broadens Global Product Line With Income Allocation Change 
      and Equity Fund Addition




Modifies International Balanced Fund to Ivy Global Income Allocation 
      Fund; Launches Ivy Global Equity Income Fund






June 04, 2012 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Effective today, Ivy Funds has expanded its global product line, 
      launching a new Ivy Global Equity Income Fund and modifying an existing 
      fund to bring to market Ivy Global Income Allocation Fund. Together, 
      these steps further enhance Ivy Funds’ global product lineup, providing 
      additional global equity and allocation choices for investors and 
      financial advisors. The changes include:
    



Ivy International Balanced Fund becomes Ivy Global Income 
        Allocation Fund: Under its new moniker and expanded investment 
        mandate, this fund, which has an objective of seeking total return 
        through a combination of current income and capital appreciation, can 
        go anywhere in the world to find the most compelling equity and 
        fixed-income investment opportunities. Until now, because the fund was 
        an international rather than a global fund, the fund’s manager was 
        unable to take advantage of investment opportunities in the United 
        States. The fund was incepted in 1994 and will carry forward its 
        performance history.
      

Ivy Global Equity Income Fund: A new fund that invests in 
        equities, primarily in developed markets, issued by companies that the 
        portfolio managers believe may generate a reasonable level of current 
        income and that demonstrate favorable prospects for total return. It 
        may invest in U.S. and non-U.S. firms of any size, though it plans to 
        primarily invest in large-cap names. The global nature of this fund 
        makes it one of the first in the industry to offer a truly global 
        equity income opportunity.
      


      These changes mean that the Ivy Funds family offers a comprehensive 
      lineup for a range of investor needs, including flexible portfolio funds 
      that can invest in any asset class around the world; allocation funds 
      that typically seek to maintain a consistent balance of investments 
      within ranges defined by each fund’s prospectus; and funds designed to 
      generate consistent income, such as through dividend-paying stocks or 
      high-yield and municipal bonds.
    

      “Investors increasingly are looking for dividend-income potential, given 
      today’s secular demographic realities and low-interest rate, slow-growth 
      economic environment,” said Thomas W. Butch, president and CEO of Ivy 
      Funds Distributor, Inc. “These additions to the Ivy Funds lineup give 
      investors the ability to pursue dividend income through investments 
      around the world very efficiently, whether they want dividend paying 
      equities or a broader allocation approach that includes fixed income.”
    

      Ivy Global Income Allocation Fund is co-managed by John Maxwell, CFA, 
      who has 20 years of industry experience and has managed the former Ivy 
      International Balanced Fund for the last three years, and W. Jeffery 
      Surles, CFA, who has 11 years of industry experience and has been a 
      fixed income investment analyst with Ivy Funds for five years. Robert 
      Nightingale, who has been with Ivy Funds for 16 years, is assistant 
      portfolio manager on the fund.
    

      Ivy Global Equity Income Fund is co-managed by Maxwell and Nightingale.
    

      By prospectus, Ivy Global Income Allocation Fund will ordinarily invest 
      at least 35 percent of its total assets in equity investments, at least 
      25 percent in fixed-income securities and may invest up to 35 percent of 
      its total assets in non-investment grade (low-rated) debt securities, 
      which could provide additional income for shareholders, albeit at 
      greater risk. Its benchmark is a 60 percent/40 percent blend of the MSCI 
      World High Dividend Yield Index and the Barclays Multiverse Index, a 
      custom blend index. Barclays Multiverse Index is comprised of securities 
      that represent the global bond market. MSCI World High Dividend Yield 
      Index is designed to reflect the performance of equities (excluding 
      REITs) with higher than average dividend yields that are both 
      sustainable and persistent.
    

      Ivy Global Equity Income Fund, according to its prospectus, will invest 
      at least 80 percent of its net assets in equity securities, with a focus 
      on dividend-paying securities around the globe. Its benchmark is the 
      MSCI World High Dividend Yield Index.
    

      Industry analysts report that equity income funds have grown in demand 
      as investors reach for yield. According to Strategic Insight, for 
      example, investors directed more than $32 billion into equity income 
      funds in 2011, one of the only positive flow-garnering equity categories 
      for the year.
    

      Ivy Funds offers a broad fund lineup covering all major asset 
      categories, including international and domestic equity funds, specialty 
      funds, fixed income funds and money market funds.
    

      Ivy Funds Distributor, Inc. is an affiliate of Waddell & Reed Financial, 
      Inc. (NYSE:WDR). Through its subsidiaries, Waddell & Reed Financial, 
      Inc. provides investment management and financial planning services to 
      clients throughout the United States. Ivy Investment Management Company 
      serves as investment advisor to the Ivy Funds. Ivy Funds Distributor, 
      Inc. serves as principal underwriter and distributor to the Ivy Funds.
    

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges 
      and expenses of a fund carefully before investing. For a prospectus, or 
      if available, a summary prospectus, containing this and other 
      information for any of the Ivy Funds, call your financial advisor or 
      visit www.ivyfunds.com.
Please read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before 
      investing.


Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and it is 
      possible to lose money by investing. Past performance is not a guarantee 
      of future results.


Consider all factors. An investment in the Funds is not a bank 
      deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit 
      Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. International 
      investing involves additional risks including currency fluctuations, 
      political or economic conditions affecting the foreign country, and 
      differences in accounting standards and foreign regulations. These risks 
      are magnified in emerging markets. Fixed income securities are subject 
      to interest rate risk and, as such, the net asset value of the Funds may 
      fall as interest rates rise. Investing in high-income securities may 
      carry a greater risk of nonpayment or interest or principal than 
      higher-rated bonds. Dividend-paying investments may not experience the 
      same price appreciation as non-dividend paying instruments. 
      Dividend-paying companies may not pay a dividend or the dividend may be 
      less than expected. These and other risks are more fully described in 
      the Funds’ prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at 
      all broker/dealers.
