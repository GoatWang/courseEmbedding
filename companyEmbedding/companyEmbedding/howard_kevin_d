Apparatus for enhancing performance of a parallel processing environment, and associated methods



Patent number:  9626329
                                            

Abstract:  Parallel Processing Communication Accelerator (PPCA) systems and methods for enhancing performance of a Parallel Processing Environment (PPE). In an embodiment, a Message Passing Interface (MPI) devolver enabled PPCA is in communication with the PPE and a host node. The host node executes at least a parallel processing application and an MPI process. The MPI devolver communicates with the MPI process and the PPE to improve the performance of the PPE by offloading MPI process functionality to the PPCA. Offloading MPI processing to the PPCA frees the host node for other processing tasks, for example, executing the parallel processing application, thereby improving the performance of the PPE.

Publication number:  20160226658
                                            

Abstract:  An encryption system and method has processors and a memory system, the memory system configured to hold at least one macroblock, an encryption key, and machine readable instructions for encrypting the macroblock. The instructions include instructions for dividing the macroblock into at subblocks by rows and encrypting the rows, for dividing the macroblock into subblocks by columns and encrypting the columns, and for performing a combining cipher of the first, second, third and fourth cipher blocks to produce a final ciphertext of the macroblock. In alternative embodiments, the macroblock is divided in a third, or fourth dimension in addition to rows and columns. In embodiments, ciphertext is chained by using it ciphertext as part of a key for later macroblocks of a sequence, or propagated into later sequences of macroblocks.

Project planning and debugging from functional decomposition



Patent number:  9395954
                                            

Abstract:  A system and method for performing functional decomposition of a software design to generate a computer-executable FSM and a graphical representation of the design in a decomposition diagram stored in a program database with source code, test code, and other program data. The method includes searching for pre-existing software modules that meet program design requirements. Modules needing work are displayed on Gantt or PERT charts as tasks, and may be annotated with start dates, and completion dates. Percent complete of the design is automatically generated and updated, and may be displayed on the charts. The decomposition is automatically used to introduce error detection states into the FSM for recognizing invalid states and saving checkpoints, and for recognizing and repairing both race conditions and deadlock conditions in the design.

Automated latency management and cross-communication exchange conversion



Patent number:  9229688
                                            

Abstract:  A system and method for performing functional decomposition of a software design to generate a computer-executable FSM and a graphical representation of the design in a decomposition diagram stored in a program database with source code, test code, and other program data. The method includes searching for pre-existing software modules that meet program design requirements. Modules needing work are displayed on Gantt or PERT charts as tasks, and may be annotated with start dates, and completion dates. Percent complete of the design is automatically generated and updated, and may be displayed on the charts. The decomposition is automatically used to introduce error detection states into the FSM for recognizing invalid states and saving checkpoints, and for recognizing and repairing both race conditions and deadlock conditions in the design.

Parallelism From Functional Decomposition



Publication number:  20150220309
                                            

Abstract:  A system and method for performing functional decomposition of a software design to generate a computer-executable finite state machine. Initially, the software design is received in a form wherein functions in the software design are repetitively decomposed into (1) data and control transformations. Included between the functions are control flow indicators which have transformation-selection conditions associated therewith. The data transformations and the control transformations are translated into states in the finite state machine. The transformation-selection conditions associated with the control transformations are translated into state transitions in the finite state machine.

Product Description▼▲
Written with Christian and Jewish audiences in mind, The Feasts of the Lord takes the reader through all the holy days of Israel. These ancient celebrations come alive as they are enhanced with over one hundred and fifty full-color charts, photographs and paintings. As the history of the Judean holy days is revealed, the Jewish customs that serve as the most foundational facts of Christianity are brought to light. As Rosenthal and Howard strive to create a fresh understanding, these traditions are weighed in the light of God's Word to reveal the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth. About the Authors:Kevin Howard is an ordained minister with unique insight into Jewish culture and the Hebrew language as a result of his involvement in the synagogue, the Jewish community, and his trips to Israel. He spent six years as an administrator and Bible teacher with The Friends of Israel Gospel Ministry, Inc, a world-wide missionary organization to the Jewish people. Marvin Rosenthal was born and raised in a conservative Jewish home and then became a Christian as a teenage by following the godly example of his mother. He served in the pastorate for six years, before serving The Friends of Israel Gospel Ministry, Inc. as a director for sixteen years.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Isreal's feasts are infinitely more important than just a series of cultural observances. These feasts are appointed by the Lord, and they are owned by the Lord. He calls them "my feasts." Together they form God's prophetic calendar, outlining the work of history's most important person...Jesus, the Messiah. As such, few themes are more timely or rewarding for God's people today. The Feasts of the Lord covers all aspects of the biblical feasts...historical background, biblical observance, and prophetic significance. Yet, this book is not just another reference book on the feasts. It is written from the Hebrew Christian viewpoint, helping you to see the feasts through Jewish eyes. The words of the Savior, His messianic claims, and Bible prophecy will all take on a rich, new relevance for you against the exciting backdrop of The Feasts of the Lord.

            Acquired this book to join a study group looking at the Jewish Feasts and the impact and connections of those feasts to various Christian traditions and historical occurrences.


Excellent book for studying the above - well written, scripturally based, and very readable.


I have recommended this book to many folks.  Even bought a Shofar to blow on appropriate dates!

            written in 1987 but current to today's knowledge that the feasts are called "The Lords Feasts".  The feasts were to be celebrated as God's moeds, (appointed times), as  God's Holy Convocations (rehersals ....of God' s plan of salvation for mankind), which much of the Church body are just coming to recognize as well as many of our Jewish Brethern.  Probably  one of the most unknown fact is that the Raptue of the Redeemed will happen on one of two days set aside forThe Feast of  Rosh Hashanha, (the feast of the blowing of the Trumpets) which was alluded by the phrase of our Lord Jesus Christ when He said, "no one knows the day or the hour except the Father" which is a reference to this fall feast, an obligatory celebration for all Jewish people. This book is current today by explaining the meaning as historically celebrated and understood today by the Jews and then continues to explain the Feasts from God's perspective, for His plan for Redemption of fallen man.

            Mr. Rosenthal is one of my favorites. Through him, Zola Levitt, and other Hebrew Christian authors/teachers I have found my roots in my faith! I had bought this book in the late 90's and was it was through this book I began to learn about The Feasts and and Messianic fulfillment. If you are SERIOUS about your faith and want to grow deeper in your relationship with Our LORD this book is a great start. Shalom.

Health Enhancement Products, Inc.,Howard R. Baer and Kevin C. Baer


The Commission filed a complaint against defendants Howard R. Baer and Kevin C. Baer on November 20, 2006.  The Commission’s complaint alleged that Howard R. Baer and his son, Kevin C. Baer, participated in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the stock of Health Enhancement Products, Inc. (“HEPI”), a start-up nutraceutical company.  In the fall of 2003, Howard R. Baer, a recidivist securities law violator, obtained control over a majority of HEPI’s common stock, and became the Chief Executive Officer of HEPI.  Howard R. Baer, with the assistance of Kevin C. Baer, HEPI’s executive vice-president, then disseminated materially misleading information about HEPI and the company’s primary product, ProAlgaZyme, a purported natural dietary supplement, in press releases and the company’s annual, quarterly, and current public filings.  HEPI claimed that ProAlgaZyme was a potential cure-all for numerous diseases and illnesses.  For instance, in a January 20, 2004 press release, HEPI announced that the biochemistry department of Arizona State University ("ASU") had conducted an independent study that “concluded that . . . ProAlgaZyme . . . possesses fibrinolytic properties, required in the breakdown of pathological fibrin gel, thus decreasing the risk of a stroke or heart attack.”  Further, the press release quoted Howard R. Baer as saying that “[t]he study provides conclusive evidence of the efficacy of ProAlgaZyme.”  These representations were false.  In fact, the ASU scientists did not conclude that ProAlgaZyme reduced the risk of a stroke or heart attack.
            While HEPI was issuing these misleading press releases, Howard R. Baer executed numerous trades in the company’s stock to ensure that the price and trading volume increased.  In fact, HEPI’s stock price increased from approximately $0.01 per share in October 2003 to $7.54 per share in February 2004.  Howard R. Baer profited from his fraudulent conduct.  During the relevant period, Howard R. Baer sold over 390,000 shares of HEPI stock, primarily in an account in his wife’s name, for proceeds of more than $1,349,000.
Based on these allegations, the Commission charged Howard R. Baer with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 10(b) and 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 and 13a-14 thereunder.  The Commission charged Kevin C. Baer with violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  On November 29, 2006, the Court entered a final judgment against Howard R. Baer ordering him to disgorge $1,349,592.81 plus prejudgment interest of $88,734.60 for total of $1,438,327.41 and to pay a civil penalty of $120,000.[1]  The disgorgement and prejudgment interest were payable to the clerk of the court for deposit into an interest bearing account with the Court Registry Investment System (“CRIS”), and the penalty was payable to the Commission for remission to the U.S. Treasury.  A total of $1,421,000 was paid to the Court.
            The funds collected, plus any interest earned thereon, less any payments for taxes, fees, and expenses, will be distributed to injured investors.  Pursuant to the Court approved distribution plan, payments will be made:


		First, pro rata to investors other that the “Institutional Investors” (defined as registered broker-dealers), who had purchased HEPI common stock during the period of the market manipulation and who has sustained an Eligible Loss;

		Second, if any amounts remain, to the Institutional Investors who sustained an Eligible Loss;[2] and

		Finally, if any amounts remained, to the Commission to remit to the Treasury,

See the distribution plan.
Rust Consulting, Inc. has been appointed as the Distribution Agent.  For more information, please contact:

 [1] A judgment was also entered against Kevin C. Baer ordering him to pay civil penalty of $25,000 to the Commission for remission to the U.S. Treasury. 


 [2] The reason for separating the Institutional Investors was that, as market makers, they represented at least half of the trades during the market manipulation and therefore would have obtained a significant share of any distribution to the prejudice of the investing public.
