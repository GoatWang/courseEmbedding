AMY H. NELSON, 47, joined the company’s board of directors in February 2014. She is a member of the Audit Committee.
Nelson is the president of Greenridge Advisors, LLC, which she founded in 2007 as an energy services and equipment consulting firm focused on the development, execution, and financing of growth strategies. Nelson advises her clients on strategy development, capital allocation, acquisition evaluation and infrastructure development. Her clients span a broad range of oilfield service, product and geographic markets.
From 2000 to 2007, Nelson served as a vice president of SCF Partners, an oilfield service and equipment-focused private equity firm, where she concentrated on investment strategy, investment execution and portfolio company management.
From 1992 to 1998, Nelson worked for Amoco Production Company in planning, project management and engineering roles.
Nelson has devoted her career to serving companies in the oil and gas industry. Nelson’s experiences have provided her with valuable insight into corporate strategy, capital allocation, and the assessment and management of risks faced by oil and gas companies.
Over the past decade, Nelson has also developed substantial water-related expertise in unconventional field development water cycle, including treatment technologies, water delivery and take-away temporary and permanent infrastructure, frac-water sources, containment and salt water disposal, management of access rights to ground, surface, industrial, and municipal water sources, and management of regulatory and compliance issues. Nelson’s understanding of this important environmental subject enhances her contributions to the board.
