Dynegy Inc. Acquires Direct Ownership of Subsidiary Dynegy Coal Holdco, LLC | Business Wire
























































Dynegy Inc. Acquires Direct Ownership of 
      Subsidiary Dynegy Coal Holdco, LLC






September 02, 2011 07:59 AM Eastern Daylight Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dynegy Inc. (the Company) (NYSE: DYN) today announced that it has 
      acquired direct ownership of Dynegy Coal Holdco, LLC (Coal Holdco), the 
      indirect parent of the Company’s subsidiary Dynegy Midwest Generation, 
      LLC (CoalCo). As announced on August 8, 2011, the Company established 
      CoalCo as part of an internal restructuring designed to increase 
      flexibility and optimize asset value by creating separate coal-fueled 
      and gas-fueled power generation units, for which $1.7 billion in stand 
      alone first lien financings were obtained. The transfer of Coal Holdco 
      will help the Company delever its consolidated balance sheet by 
      facilitating one or more potential transactions, which are currently 
      under consideration by the Finance and Restructuring Committee of the 
      Board. These potential transactions include exchanges of some or all of 
      Dynegy Holdings’ outstanding $3.5 billion in notes for new notes and/or 
      cash. Such transactions may be implemented in privately-negotiated 
      transactions or otherwise.
    

      The Company's management and Board of Directors concluded that the fair 
      value of the acquired equity stake in Coal Holdco, after taking into 
      account all debt obligations of CoalCo, including in particular its new 
      $600 million, five-year senior secured term loan facility, is 
      approximately $1.25 billion. This value was provided to Coal Holdco’s 
      former direct parent, Dynegy Gas Investments, LLC (DGI) through the 
      Company's issuance of an undertaking to make proportionate payments at 
      the times that Dynegy Holdings is obligated to make payments of 
      principal and interest under its $1.1 billion of 7.75% notes due 
      2019 and its $175 million of 7.625% notes due 2026. The undertaking does 
      not provide any rights or obligations with respect to any outstanding 
      Dynegy Holdings notes, including the notes due in 2019 and 2026.
    

      Immediately after closing the transfer, the undertaking was assigned by 
      DGI to its parent, Dynegy Holdings, for a note in the amount of $1.25 
      billion that matures in 2027. The undertaking provides for the reduction 
      of the Company's obligations if it or its subsidiaries (other than 
      Dynegy Holdings and its subsidiaries) acquire or retire any of Dynegy 
      Holdings' outstanding $3.5 billion of notes.
    

      FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
    

      This press release contains statements reflecting assumptions, 
      expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events 
      that are intended as “forward-looking statements,” particularly those 
      statements concerning the Acquisition and the expected benefits 
      therefrom, as well as any further restructuring steps. Discussion of 
      risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from current projections, forecasts, estimates and 
      expectations of Dynegy is contained in Dynegy’s filings with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Specifically, Dynegy makes 
      reference to, and incorporates herein by reference, the section entitled 
      “Risk Factors” in its most recent Form 10-K and subsequent reports on 
      Form 10-Q. In addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth in 
      Dynegy’s SEC filings, the forward-looking statements described in this 
      press release could be affected by, among other things,(i) the 
      anticipated effectiveness of the overall restructuring activities and 
      any additional strategies to address Dynegy’s liquidity and capital 
      resources including accessing the capital markets; (ii) limitations on 
      Dynegy’s ability to utilize previously incurred federal net operating 
      losses or alternative minimum tax credits; (iii) the timing and 
      anticipated benefits to be achieved through Dynegy's cost savings 
      programs; (iv) beliefs and assumptions relating to liquidity, available 
      borrowing capacity and capital resources generally, including the extent 
      to which such liquidity could be affected by poor economic and financial 
      market conditions or new regulations and any resulting impacts on 
      financial institutions and other current and potential counterparties; 
      (v) expectations regarding environmental matters, including costs of 
      compliance, availability and adequacy of emission credits, and the 
      impact of ongoing proceedings and potential regulations or changes to 
      current regulations, including those relating to climate change, air 
      emissions, cooling water intake structures, coal combustion byproducts, 
      and other laws and regulations to which Dynegy is, or could become, 
      subject; (vi) beliefs about commodity pricing and generation volumes; 
      (vii) beliefs, assumptions and projections regarding the demand for 
      power, generation volumes and commodity pricing, including natural gas 
      prices and the impact on such prices from shale gas proliferation and 
      the timing of a recovery in natural gas prices, if any; (viii) 
      sufficiency of, access to and costs associated with coal, fuel oil and 
      natural gas inventories and transportation thereof; (ix) beliefs and 
      assumptions about market competition, generation capacity and regional 
      supply and demand characteristics of the wholesale power generation 
      market, including the anticipation of higher market pricing over the 
      longer term; (x) beliefs and assumptions regarding Dynegy’s ability to 
      enhance or protect long-term value for stockholders; (xi) the 
      effectiveness of Dynegy's strategies to capture opportunities presented 
      by changes in commodity prices and to manage its exposure to energy 
      price volatility; (xii) beliefs and assumptions about weather and 
      general economic conditions; (xiii) expectations regarding Dynegy's new 
      credit facilities compliance, collateral demands, interest expense and 
      other payments; (xiv) Dynegy's focus on safety and its ability to 
      efficiently operate its assets so as to maximize its revenue generating 
      opportunities and operating margins; (xv) beliefs about the outcome of 
      legal, regulatory, administrative and legislative matters; and (xvi) 
      expectations and estimates regarding capital and maintenance 
      expenditures, including the Midwest Consent Decree and its associated 
      costs. Any or all of Dynegy’s forward-looking statements may turn out to 
      be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or 
      unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond 
      Dynegy’s control.
