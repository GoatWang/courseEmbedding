                                        Matte finish tape is invisible when applied, making it ideal for copies. Tape pulls off the roll smoothly and cuts easily. This photo-safe tape also resists drying, yellowing, splitting, tearing and is the ideal tape for permanent paper mending and repairs. Write on the tape easily with most pens, pencils or markers. Tape has a 1" core that fits desktop and snail-style dispensers.
