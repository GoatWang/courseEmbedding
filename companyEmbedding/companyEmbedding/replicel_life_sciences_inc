Welcome to RepliCel
RepliCel is a regenerative medicine company developing autologous cell therapies to treat conditions linked to a deficit of healthy cells required for normal healing and function.
The company’s RCT-01, RCS-01, and RCH-01 cell therapies are designed to treat chronic tendinosis, UV-damaged or aged skin, and pattern baldness.  RepliCel is also developing a proprietary, next-generation injection device for delivery of its RCH-01 and RCS-01 products that also has use with other dermatological injection procedures.
RepliCel is purpose built to remain a lean, virtual development-stage company partnering with larger companies to commercialize products globally.  One such deal is already in place with Shiseido Company, and others will be announced as they are executed.

DSC Cell Therapy – Treatment for Androgenetic Alopecia
RCH-01 Development Status
RCH-01 is an autologous cell therapy utilizing dermal sheath cup (DSC) cells isolated from the hair follicle to treat androgenetic alopecia.  RepliCel’s proposed Phase 2 trial will enroll 160 male subjects in good health with mild to moderate androgenetic alopecia.  Dermal sheath cup cells will be isolated from a small punch biopsy taken from the back of the subject’s scalp.  These cells will be replicated and then reintroduced into balding areas on the subjects scalp.  After injections are performed subjects will return to the clinic for assessment of total, terminal and vellus hair density and cumulative hair thickness, as well safety.  Participants will remain in the trial for approximately 39 months.

RCH-01 is now under clinical investigation at Tokyo Medical University Hospital and Toho University Ohasi Medical Center, by Drs. Tsuboi and Niiyama.
The study is being financed by Shiseido Company and each product being injected will be manufactured by Shiseido at their SPEC (Cell-Processing and Expansion Center) facility in Kobe, Japan. RepliCel helped Shiseido design, validate, and prepare the SPEC facility for certification by Japan’s PMDA (Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency). Shiseido’s SPEC team was also trained by RepliCel and Innovacell in the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) compliant production protocols for RCH-01.
Watch our video. To learn more about RepliCel’s RCH-01 treatment for pattern baldness please watch our video.

Phase 1 Clinical EvidenceThe primary objective of the study was to assess the local (at treatment sites) safety profile of injections of autologous DSC cells at six months post-injection compared to placebo. A six-month interim analysis was designed to provide the company with safety information to support the regulatory filing for a Phase 2 clinical trial.  To learn more about our phase I results please read: Phase I Interim Analysis Nov 2012
Learn About the ProcedureRepliCel Life Sciences is developing an autologous cell-based procedure for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (pattern baldness) and general hair loss in men and women. The procedure has the potential to become the first minimally invasive solution for hair loss.

What Causes Hair Loss?No one is 100% certain of what all the contributing factors may be in hair loss; however, it is believed that there is a link between male pattern baldness (MPB), also known as androgenetic alopecia, and androgenic hormones. In males, a hormone known as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) triggers androgen receptors in hair follicles on the top of the scalp. This activation of the hormone receptors changes the cells and reduces their cell growth activity. Over time, the hair follicle miniaturizes causing each successive growth cycle to get shorter and the hair follicles get thinner and smaller. The large terminal hair follicles turn into tiny unpigmented vellus hair follicles. Eventually, the follicles are no longer able to function properly and they completely disappear in men, though in women the follicles usually survive in their miniaturized state.
In men, balding typically starts on the top of the head. In some men the hair loss can progress until there is nothing left but a fringe of hair around the bottom half of the head. Women’s hair loss is quite different from male pattern baldness as the hair loss pattern is usually a diffuse thinning over the top of the scalp, but it too is primarily hormonally driven. It has been noted that both the number of androgen receptors and the level of 5-alpha reductase, which converts testosterone to DHT, are higher in hair follicles on top of the scalp than in the rest of the scalp. This may partly explain why hair loss occurs in hair follicles on top of the scalp while hair follicles at the back and sides of the scalp seem more resistant to the androgen hormones.
In addition to androgens causing pattern baldness, it is believed that there are other factors that contribute to the condition along the way. Some suggest that inflammation may also contribute to hair loss. Sometimes, but not always, hair follicles that are in the process of miniaturizing have inflammatory cells around them. A possible explanation for this inflammatory cells activity may be that elevated androgens also trigger increased sebum production, favoring an excess microbial and parasitic population leading to inflammation of the hair follicle.
Doctors have found a strong correlation between early onset extensive hair loss and heart disease, so there may be a common etiology outside the androgen paradigm for pattern loss.
For more information on hair loss please visit www.keratin.comCurrent TreatmentsSurgical Hair Restoration
Medical hair restoration consists of a variety of surgical hair restoration treatments designed to reduce baldness. Follicular unit hair transplant (“FUT”) surgery is by far the dominant hair restoration treatment and involves the surgical removal of large portions of hair-bearing scalp from the back of the head.
These sections of scalp skin are then dissected by hand into smaller hair follicle clusters (follicular units) and transplanted to the balding areas of a patient’s scalp. Scalp flap surgery, scalp reduction surgery and scalp expansion surgery are other forms of surgical hair restoration. Combined, these treatments represent a far smaller patient base than hair transplant surgery.
Follicular unit extraction or (“FUE”) is another type of hair transplant technique in which a small round punch is used to extract follicular units from a patient’s baldness-resistant donor area.  These 1, 2, 3 and 4-hair follicular unit grafts are then transplanted into a patient’s balding areas.  This is a time consuming and tedious procedure and a physician is often limited to transplanting only 500 to 600 follicular unit grafts in one day which means a patient often has to come in a number of times to achieve the desired result.  While the FUE procedure has grown in popularity, largely due to the minimally invasive way in which follicular unit grafts are removed, the standard strip excision method is still the leading hair transplant procedure.
However, FUT and FUE hair transplant surgery will always be limited by the availability and quality of donor hair follicles. Hair replacement surgery is a complicated procedure that may require several hair transplant sessions over a period of one-to-two years before the desired result is achieved. Ultimately, the act of hair transplantation does not ‘create’ new hair. The process simply relocates viable hair from the back of the scalp to the front. Most women will not undergo this extremely invasive surgery.  In terms of cosmetic results, both FUT and FUE surgery are quite dependent upon the skill of the surgeon.
Non-Surgical Restoration
Only two hair restoration treatments approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) are available today: minoxidil and finasteride. Minoxidil is marketed as Rogaine®. Finasteride is marketed as Propecia®. These two products can be effective in hair loss prevention and may grow new hair. However, once a patient begins using Rogaine® or Propecia®, he or she must continue to use the products indefinitely. If an individual stops using the drug, any new hair grown as a result of the drug will likely fall out. As with any drug, adverse reactions can sometimes occur.
Rogaine® (Minoxidil)
Rogaine® (minoxidil) was introduced in 1988 as the first drug approved for treatment of baldness by the FDA. It is now available over-the-counter in several countries including the USA. Minoxidil remains the only product available without a prescription that has been approved by the FDA as a proven treatment against hair loss. Minoxidil is no longer under patent so it is also marketed as a number of topical treatments made by several different companies.  Minoxidil stimulates hair growth in individuals with male and female pattern baldness; however, the mechanism of action is unknown.  It comes in 2% and 5% topical formulations and known side effects include itching and skin irritation of the treated scalp, as well as unwanted hair in areas adjacent to treatment sites which can be distressing to women when the face is involved.  Once treatment is stopped, all results will be lost within 3 to 6 months.
Propecia® (Finasteride)
Finasteride is marketed by Merck under the trademark names Proscar® and Propecia®, among other generic names.  It is a synthetic antiandrogen that inhibits type II 5-alpha reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT.  Only available by prescription, it was developed to treat mild to moderate male pattern hair loss on the vertex (top of head) and anterior mid-scalp area (middle front of head) in men only. There is insufficient evidence that Propecia® works for receding hairlines at the temples.  Listed side effects include erectile dysfunction and depression.  Once treatment is stopped, all results will be lost within 6 to 12 months.

		"Replicel Life Sciences Inc. announced statistically and clinically significant positive data from the interim analysis of its phase I study evaluating RCS-01 for the treatment of aging and sun-damaged skin, and the markets are loving the news. . .the study observed the impact of the injection on ten different biomarkers that, in peer-reviewed medical literature, are highly correlated with skin aging and chronically sun-damaged skin. . .gene expression markers, such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, showed significant changes expected to correlate with increased collagen fibers. Increased collagen production, and reduced collagen degradation, is associated with fewer wrinkles and the repair of sun-damaged skin."
		
		












  
      Douglas Loe, Echelon Wealth Partners
  

(4/4/17)

		
		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. reported interim data this morning from its 17-patient Germany-based Phase I trial evaluating impact from its autologous non-bulbar dermal sheath cell (NBDS)-based therapy RCS-01 on biochemical markers of skin rejuvenation. . .clear evidence that RCS-01
up-regulates biochemical pathways that are known to be relevant to skin rejuvenation, as study design intended. . .the trial absolutely met its primary endpoint of demonstrating safety in patients, with no serious adverse events reported at the time of the trial. . .we continue to maintain our Price Target of $3.50."
		
		












  
      Etienne Moshevich, Alphastox.com

		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. is finally in a position to drive substantial growth for shareholders by advancing all three clinical programs as well as continuing to build out their medical device. Management is most likely going to take the month of April to prepare for their next steps in each of their clinical programs and should provide an update once everything is set. . .The streets becoming more bullish on the name as the stock has risen over 30% since its lows last week. . .keep RP.V on your radar screens and keep a very close eye on the story over the next few months."

		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. announced the completion of the Phase 1 study as it successfully met its endpoints. The safety of RCH-01 was demonstrated through measurement of local and systemic tolerance that revealed no serious adverse events reported over the entire 60.5-month follow-up period. . .biopsies performed at 6, 12, and 24 months following injection did not show any evidence of the formation of tumor, granuloma, or foreign body formation. . .The results from the Phase 1 trial show that RCH-01 has a very clean safety profile."
		
		












  
      Douglas Loe, Echelon Wealth Partners
  

(3/28/17)

		
		"We are increasing our RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. price target to $3.50 from $2.15. . .we believe our valuation is conservative when considering how solidly RepliCel has demonstrated functional improvement in at least two cell therapy markets, and with new Achilles tendon repair data serving as evidence for how NBDS could be relevant to other orthopedic/tendon repair markets like rotator cuff injury, or lateral epicondytis or patellar tendinitis, all with similar pathology to Achilles tendinosis. Our model solely values RCT-01 in Achilles tendinosis for now, since that is the only active tendon repair program in RepliCel�s pipeline."

		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. recently completed a Phase 1 Clinical Trial that has moved the company that much closer to realizing that goal, and from an investor perspective, the news could not be better. . .RepliCel's attractiveness to the investment community rests on the idea that this is no "one trick pony". Besides male pattern baldness, the company is also advancing a Phase 1/2 trial through Health Canada of its RCT-01 treatment for chronic tendonitis. . .RepliCel's achievements during the first quarter of 2017 places it on a steep trajectory toward commercial success."

(3/14/17)

		
		"We are unambiguously positive about what new two-year data suggests about future clinical performance in this [androgenetic alopecia] market, and how it validates RepliCel Life Sciences Inc.�s DSC platform overall. . . RCH- 01 did hit its primary endpoint that was defined mostly by safety and adverse event rate criteria. . .we now have two-year data to show that RCH-01 had a measurable impact on hair density in a sizable proportion of patients, though we will be interested to see on longer-term follow-up."
		
		









  
      Shane Matte, BioTuesdays
(3/14/17)

		
		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. has successfully completed its first-in-human clinical study of the company's autologous cell therapy for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (pattern baldness). The Phase 1 trial met its endpoints and sets the stage for next steps in ongoing research and development of its product, RCH-01, for the treatment of male and female androgenetic alopecia. . .the five-year trial data set has confirmed the complete safety profile of a high-dose of dermal sheath cup cells (DSCC) for patients with pattern baldness due to androgenetic alopecia. No serious adverse events were reported over the entire 60.5-month follow-up period of the trial."

		"An analyst could show investors the size of these markets�skin aging, Achilles heel and hair restoration�and any of the three could represent total markets worth billions of dollars. There is an opportunity to carve out hundreds of millions in revenue to produce an extraordinary, eye-opening top line. . .focus on RepliCel Life Sciences Inc.�s current minimalist market cap of under $US20 million and the fact that movement of these clinical studies into phase 2 and phase 3 could mean a very significant increase in share price. RepliCel represents an undiscovered opportunity, but its low market cap precludes mutual funds and pensions from owning it."
		
		









  Alphastox 

(2/12/17)

		
		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc.'s randomized, placebo-controlled trials in tendon and skin repair will deliver informative data to support the company's story, prioritize future clinical development and guide critical decisions about designing future multi-center clinical trials designed to provide statistically significant clinical data and address questions related to dosing, treatment frequency, etc. . .this is sure to be one of the most exciting stories of 2017 so make sure you stay tuned and keep a very close eye on RepliCel."

		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. announced the granting of two patents in Europe related to its multi-needle dermal injection technologies; the first patent has been validated in a total of 14 national countries and the second will also be validated in a number of European countries in the near future. The first device being developed under these patents, RCI-02, is designed for injecting hyaluronic acid and other products as dermal fillers."
		
		












The  Life Sciences Report Interview with Colin Lee Novick 

(2/1/17)

		
		"Back in 2013, before the Japanese regenerative medicine laws were promulgated, RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. and Shiseido signed a deal for Replicel's RCH-01 product, which is for androgenic alopecia or male pattern baldness. Shiseido is taking the RCH-01 product down the Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine (ASRM) route to market, as they see immense market potential to offer the treatment as quickly as possible to men who suffer from pattern baldness. The ASRM route to market does not come with the coveted Japanese NHI insurance coverage, but the indication is one that doesn�t necessarily need the NHI insurance coverage incentive to work. Shiseido already has opened the Shiseido Cell-Processing and Expansion Center (SPEC) in Kobe and is using this location as its base to develop and eventually provide the therapy. Not many non-Japanese companies understand the ASRM route to market but it is one that a relatively well-known regenerative medicine company, Cytori Therapeutics, has already received multiple approvals for over the years and is a very real and relatively fast route to market that exists in Japan. I would keep my eyes peeled on RepliCel and Shiseido in the coming months too for indications as to when the therapy will become available in Japan."

		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. secured $4.2 million in cash through the closing of a private placement in October 2016. The offering was actually over-subscribed and included a healthy mix of past, existing, and new investors. . .the lack of funding was a significant overhang for the stock in 2016, but with overhang gone and two major catalysts on the very near-term horizon, this is an incredible opportunity for investors. . .it looks like the recent uptick in the stock is just the beginning for RepliCel."
		
		









  Zacks Equity Research

		"One company that looks very well-positioned to benefit from regenerative medicine's rising tide is RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. . .RepliCel is a regenerative medicine company focused on developing autologous cell therapies that address conditions linked to a deficit of healthy cells required for normal healing and function. . .the company's current focus is on the repair of chronically injured tendons, restoration of damaged skin, and the rejuvenation of hair growth.RepliCel is currently engaged in a Phase 1/2 clinical study taking place in Canada examining RCT-01 for the treatment of chronic tendinosis."

		"We've been wildly successful with a couple of our biotech picks, including RepliCel Life Sciences Inc., which is up over 250% in just three months! The company is just starting to get going and I feel we have a ton more room to grow in this deal." 
		
		












  
      Douglas Loe, Echelon Wealth Partners
  

(11/2/16)

		
		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. reported T4W returns of +49% after announcing the close of the firm�s $4.3M private placement. . .performance observed is not just that data point alone; RepliCel is nearing clinical milestones in H216 and H117, specifically with the firm�s 10-patient Phase I/II trial, evaluating the autologous non-bulbar dermal sheath cell therapy RCT-01 in patients with Achilles tendinosis. Data from this trial is expected by end of this year. . .a 17-patient skin rejuvenation Phase I/II trial in Germany could release interim sixmonth RCS-01 efficacy data by FQ117."

		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. provided two clinical and financial updates. First, the firm announced the intention of settling the firm�s debt to certain creditors through the issuance of 719,368 share-and-warrant units. . .second, the firm provided an update on its regulatory activities in Japan, as it concerns partner Shiseido (4911-JP, NR) and the firm�s autologous dermal sheath cup cell therapy RCH-01 for androgenetic alopecia. . .the firm noted RCH-01 is currently under clinical investigation at two hospitals, with the trial and the product manufactured by Shiseido. . .the firm notes that early commercialization of the product is possible in Japan."
		
		












The Life Sciences Report Interview with Eden Rahim 

(3/2/16)

		
		"I do like RepliCel Life Sciences Inc., a micro-cap, Canadian, regenerative medicine company with a novel technology developing autologous cell therapies. What's interesting about RepliCel is that it has four novel programs on the go, and management has secured a partnership with Shiseido Company in Japan to fund its alopecia trials. RCH-01 for pattern baldness could be on the market in 2018. The company has developed a dermal injector device, RCI-02, to pair with its therapeutic approach. It will file for CE mark approval of the dermal injector in the European Union (EU) later this year, and I think the product will be on the market in Europe in 2017. Management has been able to derisk this little company in a way many small companies haven't been able to do. . .[the dermal injector] is a novel instrument with extreme precision that sources the cells in the scalp. It has an analgesic delivery capability built in so it can simultaneously anesthetize the skin and obtain autologous dermal sheath cells. It will have many applications. . .RepliCel won't market the product itself, but will partner that out. The company could have the alopecia therapy on the market in Japan in 2018, and the dermal injector could be on the market in the EU in 2017. . .the device is a catalyst. Even though RepliCel will have data in the alopecia and tendon repair indications later this year, I think dermal injector may carry more weight because the market may realize it represents the fastest route to commercialization and revenues, which would help the company mitigate some of its cash burn. The adoption and costs to market the device are much less than they would be for developing and commercializing a therapeutic."

The Life Sciences Report Interview with Alan Leong  

(1/20/16)

		
		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. greets the new year with new CEO, Lee Buckler, who's been involved as part of the executive team since late 2014. He's a terrific guy, and everyone in the regenerative medicine space thinks a lot of him. I also want to pay my respects to the prior CEO and cofounder David Hall. David shepherded this company from the very beginning to its first proof of concept and corporate partnership. The company's technology platform is based on the regenerative cells of the hair follicle, which is an interesting site for cells of all types. There is a review article out there that says it all; it refers to the adult hair follicle as a 'menagerie of cells with regenerative characteristics. RepliCel's platform is a sophisticated technology that deals with different parts of the hair follicle. The company's RCT-01 (autologous non-bulbar dermal sheath cells) is being developed for Achilles tendinosis. It's isolated from the patient's scalp with a single punch biopsy. This program is in a phase 1/2 trial with 28 patients; final data collection is scheduled for September 2016. The RCH-01 (autologous dermal sheath cup cells) candidate is isolated from the bottom of the hair follicle and is a proposed therapy for androgenic alopecia�male pattern baldness. The company proposes a Phase 2 trial with 160 patients. . .the company's RCS-01 cell product is just starting a Phase 1 clinical study to rejuvenate aging skin. That trial will contain 30 patients; final data collection will occur in about February 2018. . ."

		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. announced this morning that the first group of three patients has been enrolled for the company's 30-patient Phase I clinical trial evaluating the autologous hair follicle-derived non-bulbar dermal sheath cells as a skin rejuvenation treatment in patients with ultraviolet-damaged and aged skin. . .we are encouraged by the progress made in advancing all RepliCel hair-follicle derived cell therapies into formal clinical testing."
		
		












The Life Sciences Report Interview with Alan Leong 

(9/9/15)

		
		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. caught my attention because of its hair regeneration or restoration technology. That may not be the application that first goes commercial, but it's interesting and there's a lot of money in this area. . .RepliCel has a way of using dermal-related cells that is far less invasive. . .the company's technology can be used to regenerate hair, and a related technology can be used to repair tendons for patients with tendinitis or major tendon injuries. Interestingly, because of the nature of the cells RepliCel is using and its process, cost and scale aren't issues. Other scientists give it a thumbs up, saying the science is good. The company is currently in a set of Phase 1 and 2 trials for both the hair regeneration and for tendon repair. Early results seem to be very good. RepliCel is under the radar. It based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and trades off the Canadian exchange and over the counter in the U.S. at very low prices. Keep an eye out the next set of results and for a move to a major stock exchange. For those who want to get in very early, this is a very provocative, very interesting company."

		"RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. announced that the firm has been formally cleared by the Paul Ehrlich Institute to conduct the company's Phase 1 clinical trial using its autologous hair follicle therapy RCS-01 for the purposes of skin rejuvenation in healthy volunteers. Our model had assumed that this 30-patient study could commence by H2 FY15, and we are encouraged to see that RepliCel's second Phase 1/2 cell therapy study is thus on pace to generate two-year safety/efficacy data by FY18 as we already assumed."
		
		












The Life Sciences Report Interview with Eden Rahim 

(8/12/15)

		
		"An interesting little Canadian company called RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. has, again, an autologous cell platform. It's a regeneration technology. One indication the company is going after is chronic Achilles tendinosis, and that is based on the non-bulbar dermal sheath (NBDS) cells of the hair follicle. These RCT-01 (NBDS fibroblast therapy) cells are used to restore functional deficits in the tendon, and they are harvested from a single punch biopsy. Another indication is androgenic alopecia; the company is utilizing dermal sheath cup cells isolated from the bottom of the hair follicle with its RCH-01 therapy. Here you have a micro-cap company with a technology that essentially has been endorsed by Japan-based Shiseido Co. in alopecia. RepliCel has also created a unique injector to load the stem cells back into the epidermis. This injector has a market of its own. The company also has a Phase 1 program with RCS-01 for sun-damaged and aging skin. . ."

RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. Collaborates with University of British Columbia to Build World-Class Hair Follicle Cell Data Map
Jun 13 17
RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. announced that it has signed a collaborative research project agreement with the University of British Columbia ("UBC"). The project will be co-lead by the UBC's Dr. Kevin McElwee and Professor Youwen Zhou. The project is designed to deliver a gene and protein expression "map" of healthy hair follicle cells expected to be critically important to improving key components of the manufacturing, regulatory, and clinical profile of RepliCel's cell therapy products. This study will examine different cell groups from human hair follicles and look for differences, and similarities, in gene and protein expression. Additionally, the project will analyze array data from select subjects who participated in RepliCel's phase I/IIa clinical trial of its RCH-01 product in development for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia which completed earlier this year. This includes data from patients who had the best clinical hair growth response at six months and a sustained positive response at 24 months. In the study with UBC, the gene expression profiles of the cultured cells from these clinical trial subjects who had a strong hair growth response will be compared to the gene expression profile of subjects who had a reduced hair growth response. The analysis is anticipated to allow RepliCel to better identify specific genes with high or low expression in the cultured cells that correspond to strong hair growth promotion.

(REPCF) (RP.V) (P6P2.F) ("RepliCel" or the "Company") is pleased to announce it has signed a collaborative research project agreement with the University of British Columbia ("UBC"). The project will be co-lead by the UBC's Dr. Kevin McElwee and Professor Youwen Zhou.RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. (CNW Group/RepliCel Life Sciences Inc.)MoreThe project is designed to deliver a gene and protein expression "map" of healthy hair follicle cells expected to be critically important to improving key components of the manufacturing, regulatory, and clinical profile of RepliCel's cell therapy products."We are very excited to be working with UBC on a project we've spent considerable time designing to mature our understanding of the cell populations we work with to improve our product manufacturing, clinical outcomes, and assays critical to regulatory approval and commercialization," stated RepliCel President and CEO, R. Lee Buckler.This study will examine different cell groups from human hair follicles and look for differences, and similarities, in gene and protein expression. Additionally, the project will analyze array data from select subjects who participated in RepliCel's phase I/IIa clinical trial of its RCH-01 product in development for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia which completed earlier this year. This includes data from patients who had the best clinical hair growth response at six months and a sustained positive response at 24 months.In the study with UBC, the gene expression profiles of the cultured cells from these clinical trial subjects who had a strong hair growth response will be compared to the gene expression profile of subjects who had a reduced hair growth response. The analysis is anticipated to allow RepliCel to better identify specific genes with high or low expression in the cultured cells that correspond to strong hair growth promotion.About Professor Youwen Zhou, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Youwen Zhou is a physician scientist who is a Professor at UBC's Department of Dermatology and Skin Science.  He received his BS degree from Nankai University, China, a PhD in Molecular Genetics from the State University of New York, and an MD degree from the University of Toronto.

First-in-human clinical study meets primary endpoint demonstrating product safety and clinical potential for tendon regeneration and healing
VANCOUVER, March 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. (OTCQB: REPCF) (TSXV: RP) (FRA:P6P2) ("RepliCel" or the "Company") is pleased to report compelling safety and clinical data from its phase 1/2 tendon repair study investigating the use of RepliCel's type 1 collagen-expressing, hair follicle-derived fibroblasts (RCT-01) as a treatment for Achilles tendinosis. 








The clinical trial met its goal of establishing a complete safety profile at 6 months and showed no serious adverse events related to the study treatment or injection procedure.
Additionally, each of the treated participants, all of whom suffered chronic tendon pain and loss of function over an extended period of time with no recovery from standard treatments, showed numerous clinically important improvements by various measures including tendon composition, blood supply, physical function and pain sensation.  
"Chronic tendinosis is a state of tendon degeneration that is very difficult to reverse, as evidenced by the many therapies used to try and treat it," stated Dr. Ross Davidson, an orthopedic surgeon, former clinical professor at the Department of Orthopaedics at the University of British Columbia, and past head physician and orthopaedic consultant for the Vancouver Canucks (of the National Hockey League (NHL).  
"This study shows exciting clinical improvements in patients with clinically diagnosed chronic Achilles tendinosis who were unresponsive to standard treatments, and who had suffered for many months (in some cases, years) with frequent pain and loss of function. Not only did the study show several clinically important improvements in pain and function scores, but several ultrasound measures clearly demonstrate a marked improvement in tendon structure; something rarely seen in patients with this condition," said Davidson.
"With further clinical studies, this new technology could represent a cutting-edge advancement in kick-starting a healing process that results in tendon regeneration. For the first time, we may have a treatment that shows signs of reversing the underlying problem, versus just treating the symptoms. This could be a game-changer in sports medicine," Dr. Davidson concluded.
The most clinically material improvements observed from the study are summarized as follows:











 VISA-A Scale of Achilles Tendon Injury Severity 




 Participants treated with RCT-01 in the per protocol population who completed the VISA-A evaluation 6 months after receipt of injections showed clinically relevant signals of healing including an overall 15.3% improvement in total score compared to baseline. Two patients showed select measures of near-complete recovery in function (by VISA-A scoring). 









 VAS Scale of Pain Severity 




 Four out of five participants treated with RCT-01 who completed questionnaires 6 months after injection showed clinically relevant signals of improvement in pain on loading (running/jumping) based on VAS score. Average improvement in VAS score for the four participants was 62.9% over baseline VAS score.  









 Three out of five participants treated with RCT-01 who completed questionnaires 6 months after injection showed improvement in pain on palpation based on VAS score. Average improvement in VAS score for the three participants was 55.2% over baseline VAS score. 









 Two patients showed select measures of near-complete elimination of pain (by VAS scoring).   









"This trial was to show the safety of injection of hair follicle-derived non-bulbar dermal sheath cells (NBDS)," stated RepliCel's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Rolf Hoffman, "as well as to repeat the landmark trials of our collaborators who injected skin-derived fibroblasts together with PRP (platelet-rich plasma) in different tendinopathies. We believe the cause of healing (mechanism of action) in those studies was the cellular collagen production and not the PRP which, in our view, has little clinical or commercial potential as a therapeutic product or treatment for tendon repair." 
"I am very pleased that in this trial we see some early signals of regenerative healing in some patients and because of its similar pathogenesis, there is every reason to believe the ability to heal Achilles tendons will extend to numerous applications including repairing the patellar tendon of the knee (jumper's knee), both tendons of elbow (tennis elbow, golfer's elbow), and the rotator cuff," observed Dr. Hoffmann. "Furthermore," he concluded, "when we have established that our cell therapy heals chronic tendon injury, it may then be used by physicians for more acute injury with the goal of an approved label for these additional treatments in the future."
"This is a major step forward in the Company's development of a series of products which leverage the exciting collagen-producing capacity of these cells," stated RepliCel CEO, Lee Buckler. "Our management and clinical team are very excited about the data from this trial and the potential for further development and clinical testing of this product to treat patients without good options for the tendon degeneration, pain and loss of function they are experiencing."
Buckler concluded: "We have captured the medical and investment communities' attention and see the results of this much anticipated, proof-of-concept clinical study as an opportunity to advance therapies for patients and incrementally add value for shareholders in the months ahead."
About Achilles TendinopathyAchilles tendinopathy is a condition that causes pain, swelling and stiffness of the Achilles tendon that joins your heel bone to your calf muscles. It is thought to be caused by repeated tiny injuries to the Achilles tendon. These may occur for a number of reasons, including overuse of the tendon; for example, in runners. Treatments range from physiotherapy, to anti-inflammatory medications, to surgery. For many people, symptoms of Achilles tendon injury usually clear within three to six months of starting treatment. However, for some people the injury does not respond to treatment and progresses to chronic tendinosis. There is an estimated incidence rate of 656,211 new cases of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy each year in North America alone, according to statistics published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.  
About the RCT-01 Tendon Repair StudyThe study was designed to demonstrate the safety of a single injection of RepliCel's RCT-01 into the Achilles tendon. While the study was not designed to be statistically significant for efficacy, multiple measures of efficacy were incorporated to give insights into the product's potential and to assist in guiding future development decisions. Measures of whether the product may be working included testing and scoring patient pain in various settings, evaluating overall function, blood flow changes in the tendon, and changes in the overall density and composition of the tendon as measured by ultrasound imaging. For further trial details see: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02330146.
The first-in-human study involved patients clinically diagnosed with chronic Achilles tendinosis. The primary purpose of this single-centre, phase 1/2 randomized (3:1), double blind, placebo-controlled trial was to assess the safety profile of RCT-01 injections, as compared to placebo injections. The study also measured the potential efficacy and impact injections had on tendon structure and function and the symptoms of Achilles tendinosis. The study was led by principal investigator Dr. Rob Lloyd-Smith, MDCM of the University of British Columbia (UBC) and was conducted at the UBC Sports Medicine Clinic in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Data from such a trial, not designed for statistical significance, often signals clinically significance, which is extremely informative for future product development and clinical trial design. The goal of the study was to establish sufficient evidence of safety to allow the Company to proceed with well-powered phase 2 studies investigating optimal dosing, treatment frequency, effect duration, etc. 
As was expected with injecting 1.5mL into the Achilles tendon, all study participants who received injections (less one RCT-01-injected participant) reported at least one adverse event related to treatment regardless of treatment administered (RCT-01 or placebo). The adverse events were either soreness at the injection site or the observation of a partial thickness tear in the tendon post-injection. Most reports of soreness resolved shortly after receiving injections. 
About Tendon Treatment Clinical Efficacy Measurements
VISA-AThe VISA-A scale aims to evaluate the clinical severity for patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy. It is a questionnaire which evaluates symptoms and their effect on physical activity. It can be used to compare different populations with chronic Achilles tendinopathy and facilitate comparisons between studies. It can be used to determine the patient's clinical severity. The VISA-A represents a clinically validated, reliable and disease-specific questionnaire to measure the condition of the Achilles tendon, but it is not a diagnostic tool. The final version of the questionnaire was named the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles Questionnaire.
VASA Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms. It is an instrument that measures a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. For example, the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain. From the patient's perspective, this spectrum appears on a continuum, in that their pain does not take discrete jumps, as a categorization of none, mild, moderate and severe would suggest. It was to capture this idea of an underlying continuum that the VAS was devised.
About Dr. Ross DavidsonDr. Davidson is the former Director, Post Graduate Programmes in Sports Medicine at the University of Auckland, and a member of the New Zealand Orthopaedic Association and the Canadian Orthopaedic Association. He is the past president of the National Hockey League Physicians Society, past head physician and orthopaedic consultant for the Vancouver Canucks Hockey Club (NHL), past orthopaedic consultant to the Vancouver Grizzlies Basketball Team (NBA), past orthopaedic consultant to Allan McGavin Sports Medicine Centre, and past orthopaedic consultant to the Canadian Football League Players Association. Dr. Davidson held the position of clinical professor, department of orthopaedics at the University of British Columbia until 2000.

VANCOUVER, June 13, 2017

Data from this project expected to take RepliCel's products to next level of potential commercial viability
VANCOUVER, June 13, 2017 /CNW/ - RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. (OTCQB: REPCF) (TSXV: RP) (FRA:P6P2) ("RepliCel" or the "Company") is pleased to announce it has signed a collaborative research project agreement with the University of British Columbia ("UBC"). The project will be co-lead by the UBC's Dr. Kevin McElwee and Professor Youwen Zhou.



The project is designed to deliver a gene and protein expression "map" of healthy hair follicle cells expected to be critically important to improving key components of the manufacturing, regulatory, and clinical profile of RepliCel's cell therapy products. 
"We are very excited to be working with UBC on a project we've spent considerable time designing to mature our understanding of the cell populations we work with to improve our product manufacturing, clinical outcomes, and assays critical to regulatory approval and commercialization," stated RepliCel President and CEO, R. Lee Buckler.
This study will examine different cell groups from human hair follicles and look for differences, and similarities, in gene and protein expression. Additionally, the project will analyze array data from select subjects who participated in RepliCel's phase I/IIa clinical trial of its RCH-01 product in development for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia which completed earlier this year. This includes data from patients who had the best clinical hair growth response at six months and a sustained positive response at 24 months. 
In the study with UBC, the gene expression profiles of the cultured cells from these clinical trial subjects who had a strong hair growth response will be compared to the gene expression profile of subjects who had a reduced hair growth response. The analysis is anticipated to allow RepliCel to better identify specific genes with high or low expression in the cultured cells that correspond to strong hair growth promotion.

(REPCF)(TSX VENTURE:RP)(P6P1.F), ("RepliCel" or the "Company"), a clinical-stage regenerative medicine company focused on the development of autologous cell therapies, is pleased that its RCH-01 product, for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia, is now cleared by the Japanese regulatory authorities for use in a clinical research study launching now in Japan.The study, designed to involve 60 men and women with thinning hair caused by androgenetic alopecia, will be conducted at Tokyo Medical University Hospital and Toho University Ohasi Medical Center, by Drs. Tsuboi and Niiyama. Clinical endpoints will include measures of safety and efficacy based on hair fibre thickness and density.The study is being financed by Shiseido Company and each product being injected will be manufactured by Shiseido at their SPEC (Cell-Processing and Expansion Center) facility in Kobe, Japan. RepliCel helped Shiseido design, validate, and prepare the SPEC facility for certification by Japan's PMDA (Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency). Shiseido's SPEC team was also trained by RepliCel and Innovacell in the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) compliant production protocols for RCH-01.The product being tested in the clinical study, RCH-01, is an autologous cell therapy developed by RepliCel. Shiseido has an exclusive marketing license to the product for certain Asian countries under a License and Co-development Agreement signed in 2013.As part of the Agreement between the companies, RepliCel's team trained the clinical investigatory team on critical elements of both the patient biopsy procedure and injection of the cellular product into the patient's scalp. Furthermore, the injector being used in this study mimics RepliCel's patented, first-generation injection technology.In the Agreement, Shiseido committed to sharing the clinical data from this study with RepliCel thus further strengthening the collective data package being created on RCH-01. While such data may be sufficient for Shiseido to bring RCH-01 to market in Japan, it will also be valuable to RepliCel to inform further product development and clinical testing decisions, for use in submissions to other regulatory agencies, and/or to support license negotiations for this product to parties for market rights outside of Shiseido's exclusive territory.Since the signing of the development Agreement, RepliCel has been working closely with Shiseido on the technology transfer, optimizing several features of the product's manufacturing, and continuing to add to the body of science as it relates to the product and its intended function."We believe that Japan's unique regenerative medicine regulatory and industry environment provides a unique opportunity to rapidly advance this product in their country. We are excited that RCH-01 has the potential to be launched in the Japanese market by Shiseido sooner than anywhere else in the world," stated RepliCel CEO, R. Lee Buckler.About RCH-01RCH-01 is an autologous cell therapy utilizing dermal sheath cup (DSC) cells isolated from the hair follicle to treat androgenetic alopecia. To manufacture RCH-01, dermal sheath cup cells are isolated from a small punch biopsy taken from the back of a subject's scalp. These cells are replicated in a GMP compliant cell production facility and the cells are then injected into balding areas on the same subject's scalp. In clinical trials, after injections are performed, subjects return to the clinic at regular intervals for assessment of total, terminal and vellus hair density and cumulative hair thickness, as well as for safety and data collection.Since signing the regional licensing and co-development agreement, ReplCel and Shiseido have optimized the product and its manufacturing including building, validating, and obtaining PMDA certification of Shiseido's facility purpose-built for this product, successfully completed the transfer of the manufacturing protocols and the product manufacturing validations, selected the clinical sites, trained all related personnel, and obtained regulatory clearance for the clinical study.Market: $3.5 billion was spent on hair loss treatments in 2015 according to the Washington Post, with $2.5 billion of this spent on surgical procedures according to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery. We believe RCH-01 has the potential to capture a good percentage of that surgical expenditure, but also to significantly grow the market as most hair loss sufferers elect to avoid hair transplant surgery due to the invasiveness and variability associated with the procedure.Read MoreAbout RepliCel Life SciencesRepliCel is a regenerative medicine company focused on developing autologous cell therapies that address conditions caused by a deficit of healthy cells required for normal tissue healing and function.
