Our Strategy
What is a REIT





Our Strategy



Superior Diversified Portfolio
We own one of the most geographically diversified portfolios of superior hotel real estate in the industry and partner with leading operators and premier brands in the hospitality industry. We target high-quality assets in major markets and premier resort and convention destinations, while utilizing the strength of our balance sheet to be opportunistic and flexible in our approach. We remain disciplined yet nimble and open to investing in lodging assets that are accretive to our stockholders and where we believe our employees and analytical expertise can create real value. Our diverse portfolio of high-quality hotel properties is a key component of driving stockholder value.
 
Strong Asset Management
Our strategy is to drive operating performance and implement value-added real estate decisions to maximize stockholder value and drive long-term profitability. To enhance our profitability, our enterprise analytics group offers independent feasibility, business intelligence, revenue management, capital expenditures acumen and financial planning and analysis. This distinctive expertise allows us to benchmark and monitor hotel performance and cost controls and complete deep-dive analytic reviews across brands and properties to seek new opportunities that could increase profit. These core functions assist our asset management team in focusing on their key goal of maximizing EBITDA per room at every one of our hotels and enhancing the overall portfolio. Working closely with our operators, our asset managers ensure the best practices and strategic initiatives learned at individual properties are being deployed at each hotel.  When possible, we also look for ways to improve contract flexibility through the extension or purchase of ground leases or the restructuring of management agreements. Ultimately, through successful execution of these strategies, we strive to maximize the performance of our hotels and position us to pursue higher sales proceeds upon disposition.
 
Strategic Capital Allocation and Value Enhancement
We are disciplined with capital allocation and focused on seeking to earn returns that exceed our cost of capital, with the goal of creating long-term value and strong returns for our stockholders. We are prudent with our investments and go beyond the acquisition of marquis properties, constantly mining and seeking to enhance the value of our irreplaceable real estate through value enhancement initiatives. We believe opportunities may exist across our portfolio and we critically analyze the wealth of data and information from our properties to implement strategies that capitalize on the value of the real estate.  




What is a REIT



According to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), a Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT, is a company that owns or finances income-producing real estate. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs provide investors of all types regular income streams, diversification and long-term capital appreciation. REITs typically pay out all of their taxable income as dividends to shareholders. In turn, shareholders pay the income taxes on those dividends. 
REITs allow anyone to invest in portfolios of large-scale properties the same way they invest in other industries – through the purchase of stock. In the same way shareholders benefit by owning stocks in other corporations, the stockholders of a REIT earn a share of the income produced through real estate investment – without actually having to go out and buy or finance property.

Host Hotels & Resorts Becomes #16 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Leggett & Platt
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 03/31/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

Host Hotels & Resorts (NYSE: HST) is an American real estate investment trust and the owner of lodging real estate based in Bethesda, Maryland.
History[edit]
Host Hotels & Resorts was formed in 1993 when the Marriott Corporation split into two separate entities, creating Marriott International and Host Marriott. The latter was renamed Host Hotels & Resorts in 2005, to reflect a growing number of non-Marriott hotels in their portfolio.[3]
Marriott International represented the original Marriott company prior to Marriott's 1982 acquisition of the old Host International Company, founded in 1897 as the Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company by the Van Noy Brothers of Kansas City, MO. After the spin-off, the original assets and services comprising the Host International acquisition, encompassing the ownership of lodging real estate and operators of airport terminal concession businesses and franchises, were consolidated as the Host Marriott Corporation.
On January 2, 1996, Host Marriott further divided into two separate companies. Host Marriott continues to own lodging real estate. A new company, Host Marriott Services Corporation (now known as HMSHost Corporation) was created to hold and operate concessions at airports, on toll roads, and at sports and entertainment attractions.
On April 4, 1996, Host Marriott sold 18 Residence Inns and 16 Marriott Courtyard Hotels to Hospitality Properties Trust to focus on other areas of the business.[4]
On June 21, 1997, Host Marriott acquired Forum Group, Inc. and its retirement communities, Marriott Senior Living Services.[5]
In December 1998, Crestline Capital Corporation was spun off to allow Host Marriott to complete an announced conversion to a REIT. As part of the spinoff, Host Marriott arranged to lease back much of the property that was being spun off. At the end of the year, the preparations were completed with Host Marriott emerging as a REIT on January 1, 1999.[6]
November 2005, Host Marriott announced that it would purchase 38 domestic and international hotel properties for approximately $4.1 billion. The seller was Starwood Hotels & Resorts, a hotel owner/operator based in White Plains, New York. Starwood would continue to manage the portfolio of 20 Sheratons, 13 Westins, two W's, one St Regis, one Luxury Collection hotel, one nonbranded property. As part of the transaction, Host Marriott was renamed Host Hotels & Resorts to better reflect its more diversified portfolio of hotel brands.[7]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Host Hotels & Resorts (NYSE: HST) is an American real estate investment trust and the owner of lodging real estate based in Bethesda, Maryland.
History[edit]
Host Hotels & Resorts was formed in 1993 when the Marriott Corporation split into two separate entities, creating Marriott International and Host Marriott. The latter was renamed Host Hotels & Resorts in 2005, to reflect a growing number of non-Marriott hotels in their portfolio.[3]
Marriott International represented the original Marriott company prior to Marriott's 1982 acquisition of the old Host International Company, founded in 1897 as the Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company by the Van Noy Brothers of Kansas City, MO. After the spin-off, the original assets and services comprising the Host International acquisition, encompassing the ownership of lodging real estate and operators of airport terminal concession businesses and franchises, were consolidated as the Host Marriott Corporation.
On January 2, 1996, Host Marriott further divided into two separate companies. Host Marriott continues to own lodging real estate. A new company, Host Marriott Services Corporation (now known as HMSHost Corporation) was created to hold and operate concessions at airports, on toll roads, and at sports and entertainment attractions.
On April 4, 1996, Host Marriott sold 18 Residence Inns and 16 Marriott Courtyard Hotels to Hospitality Properties Trust to focus on other areas of the business.[4]
On June 21, 1997, Host Marriott acquired Forum Group, Inc. and its retirement communities, Marriott Senior Living Services.[5]
In December 1998, Crestline Capital Corporation was spun off to allow Host Marriott to complete an announced conversion to a REIT. As part of the spinoff, Host Marriott arranged to lease back much of the property that was being spun off. At the end of the year, the preparations were completed with Host Marriott emerging as a REIT on January 1, 1999.[6]
November 2005, Host Marriott announced that it would purchase 38 domestic and international hotel properties for approximately $4.1 billion. The seller was Starwood Hotels & Resorts, a hotel owner/operator based in White Plains, New York. Starwood would continue to manage the portfolio of 20 Sheratons, 13 Westins, two W's, one St Regis, one Luxury Collection hotel, one nonbranded property. As part of the transaction, Host Marriott was renamed Host Hotels & Resorts to better reflect its more diversified portfolio of hotel brands.[7]

Host Hotels & Resorts (NYSE: HST) is an American real estate investment trust and the owner of lodging real estate based in Bethesda, Maryland.
History[edit]
Host Hotels & Resorts was formed in 1993 when the Marriott Corporation split into two separate entities, creating Marriott International and Host Marriott. The latter was renamed Host Hotels & Resorts in 2005, to reflect a growing number of non-Marriott hotels in their portfolio.[3]
Marriott International represented the original Marriott company prior to Marriott's 1982 acquisition of the old Host International Company, founded in 1897 as the Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company by the Van Noy Brothers of Kansas City, MO. After the spin-off, the original assets and services comprising the Host International acquisition, encompassing the ownership of lodging real estate and operators of airport terminal concession businesses and franchises, were consolidated as the Host Marriott Corporation.
On January 2, 1996, Host Marriott further divided into two separate companies. Host Marriott continues to own lodging real estate. A new company, Host Marriott Services Corporation (now known as HMSHost Corporation) was created to hold and operate concessions at airports, on toll roads, and at sports and entertainment attractions.
On April 4, 1996, Host Marriott sold 18 Residence Inns and 16 Marriott Courtyard Hotels to Hospitality Properties Trust to focus on other areas of the business.[4]
On June 21, 1997, Host Marriott acquired Forum Group, Inc. and its retirement communities, Marriott Senior Living Services.[5]
In December 1998, Crestline Capital Corporation was spun off to allow Host Marriott to complete an announced conversion to a REIT. As part of the spinoff, Host Marriott arranged to lease back much of the property that was being spun off. At the end of the year, the preparations were completed with Host Marriott emerging as a REIT on January 1, 1999.[6]
November 2005, Host Marriott announced that it would purchase 38 domestic and international hotel properties for approximately $4.1 billion. The seller was Starwood Hotels & Resorts, a hotel owner/operator based in White Plains, New York. Starwood would continue to manage the portfolio of 20 Sheratons, 13 Westins, two W's, one St Regis, one Luxury Collection hotel, one nonbranded property. As part of the transaction, Host Marriott was renamed Host Hotels & Resorts to better reflect its more diversified portfolio of hotel brands.[7]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
