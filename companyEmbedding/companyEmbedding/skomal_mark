About the Author


Dr. Gregory Skomal is an accomplished marine biologist, underwater explorer, photographer, aquarist, and author. He has been a fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries since 1987 and currently heads up the Massachusetts Shark Research Program. Greg holds a master’s degree in marine biology from the University of Rhode Island and a PhD from the Boston University Marine Program in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. His research has spanned multiple fish habitats around the globe, taking him from the frigid waters of the Arctic Circle to coral reefs in the tropical Central Pacific. He has written numerous scientific research papers and has appeared in a number of film and television documentaries, including programs for the National Geographic Channel, Discovery Channel, ESPN, and CBS. Although his research passion for the last 23 years has been sharks, he has been an avid aquarist for more than 30 years and has written nine books on aquarium keeping. His home and laboratory are on the island of Martha’s Vineyard off the coast of Massachusetts.

T.on May 3, 2015Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI am a big fan of the "for dummies" series. While, I got some information out of this book, I felt as of it was a bit outdated and the information wasn't sufficient enough. I would recommend it to someone who is very new to the hobby but I wouldn't use it as your only source. I would also recommend you read the book by a computer so you can look up the fish and equipment discussed since the book doesn't provide very good visuals.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsEasy read with a great balance of readability and technical information. Should be in any new marine aquarist's libraryByRoger A. Grimeson November 30, 2015Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI'm a new aquarist. I bought 8 marine aquarium books from Amazon. I consider this one of the top books of the group and easily the easiest to read with a nice  balance of information versus technical discussion. Not perfect, but definitely the one that I ended up making up my list of things I still needed to do. Not overly technical, as many of the books are. Easy read. Author is as good at writing as he is at being a marine biologist. Not perfect, but close. Could use some updating on lights and other areas, where the author either doesn't discuss the newest, better technology, or just barely covers it. I wish marine life discussions included color photos (instead of black and white drawings) and more pictures of different marine life. I'm already a big fan of the Dummies books and I always buy one when I'm trying to learn something new. This book is an excellent example of why everyone interested in new subject should by a Dummies book as part of their knowledge investigation.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA must read for anyone considering a saltwater tankByJ. Neefon November 16, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI love the book, it made it easy to understand and made a very complex subject matter approachable. I bought in unison with "The Complete Idiots Guide to Saltwater Aqauirums" and I recomend both. Excellent material well covered with simple yet detailed hand drawn images and alot of tips and tricks. I own a 90 reef tank now and love it but I always keep these as a reference because the material is that good. IF YOUR EVEN THINKING ABOUT A SALTWATER TANK BUY THE BOOKS this is an expensive hobby and these will pay for themselves 1000 times over.Read more0Comment|

I am a big fan of the "... for Dummies" series as beginner guides for personal hobbies. This book was extremely helpful in both the content and the organization of the information. The author provides practical advice on everything from choosing fish to maintaining water quality. I completed the book feeling I had a solid start on my dream of having a salt water aquarium. It is a must-have for beginner salt water aquarium enthusiasts.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsSome of the info is a little outdated but it still has great information about the different kinds of animals you can ...ByAmazon Customeron January 26, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI read this in a week it is full of information.
