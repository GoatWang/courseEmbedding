Consensus Ratings for Greenpro Capital Corp (NASDAQ:GRNQ) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

	CAUTIONARY
	NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS





	 





	This
	Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts but
	rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections. We may use words such as “anticipate,” “expect,”
	“intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “foresee,” “estimate” and variations
	of these words and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance
	and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict
	and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted. These risks and uncertainties include
	the following:





	 






	 





	●






	The
	availability and adequacy of our cash flow to meet our requirements;

	●






	Competition
	in our industry;







	 




	 




	 






	 





	●






	The
	loss of or failure to obtain any license or permit necessary or desirable in the operation of our business;







	 




	 




	 






	 





	●






	Changes
	in our business strategy, capital improvements or development plans;







	 




	 




	 






	 





	●






	The
	availability of additional capital to support capital improvements and development; and







	 




	 




	 






	 





	●






	Other
	risks identified in this report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the SEC.








	 






	This
	report should be read completely and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from what we
	expect. The forward looking statements included in this report are made as of the date of this report and should be evaluated
	with consideration of any changes occurring after the date of this Report. We will not update forward-looking statements even
	though our situation may change in the future and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as
	a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

	Overview





	 




	We
	were incorporated on July 19, 2013 in the state of Nevada under the name Greenpro, Inc. On May 6, 2015, we changed our name to
	Greenpro Capital Corp. Our principal executive office is located at Suite 2201, 22/F, Malaysia Building, 50 Gloucester Road, Wanchai,
	Hong Kong. Our principal telephone number is + (852) 3111 -7718. Our website is at: 

	http://www.greenprocapital.com

	and information contained on our web site is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities
	and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). 




	 






	We
	currently operate and provide a wide range of business solution services varying from cloud system solution, financial consulting
	services and corporate accounting services to small and medium-size businesses located in Asia, with an initial focus on Hong
	Kong, China and Malaysia. Our comprehensive range of services cover cloud accounting solutions, cross-border business solutions,
	record management services, and accounting outsourcing services. Our cross border business services include, among other services,
	tax planning, trust and wealth management, cross border listing advisory services and transaction services. We hope to develop
	a package solution of services (“Package Solution”) that will build a cloud solution into traditional accounting services.
	By using a Package Solution, we believe that we can assist our clients to reduce their business costs and improve their revenues.




	 




	In
	addition to our business solution services, we also operate a venture capital business through Greenpro Venture Capital Limited,
	an Anguilla corporation. Our venture capital business is focused on establishing a business incubator for start-up and high growth
	companies to support them during their critical growth periods and investing in select start-up and high growth companies. We
	expect to target companies located in Asia and Southeast Asia including Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, Thailand, and Singapore. We
	also anticipate our venture capital business to also engage in the purchase, acquisition and rental of commercial properties in
	the same Asia and Southeast Asia region.




	 




	To
	support our venture capital business, we partnered with QSC Asia Sdn. Bhd., an education and training company that arranges seminars
	and courses in Malaysia, to provide business and educational and support services. Specifically, we hope to arrange one or more
	seminars called the CEO & Business Owners Strategic Session (CBOSS) for business owners who are interested in the following:




	 






	 




	●




	Developing
	the business globally






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Expanding
	business with increase capital funds






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Creating
	a sustainable SME business model






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Accelerating
	the growth of the business






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Increasing
	company cash flow significantly






	 




	The
	objective of the CBOSS seminar will be to educate the Chief Executive Officer or business owner on how to acquire “smart
	capital” and the considerations involved. We expect the seminar to include an introduction to the basic concepts of “smart
	capital,” “wealth and value creation,” recommendation and planning and similar topics. We believe that the seminar
	will synergistically support our venture capital business segment.




	 




	We
	expect to operate our venture capital related education and support services through our subsidiary Greenpro Global Advisory Sdn.
	Bhd., which was renamed Greenpro Capital Village Sdn. Bhd. on September 23, 2015. On October 1, 2015, QSC Asia Sdn. Bhd., an unaffiliated
	third party, acquired 49% of Greenpro Capital Village Sdn. Bhd. in consideration of $11,000 (RM 49,000) from Greenpro Financial
	Consulting Limited. Concurrently with such sale, Greenpro Financial Consulting Limited transferred 51% of Greenpro Capital Village
	Sdn. Bhd. to Greenpro Holding Limited, our subsidiary.

	and other corporate matters. Our plan is to bundle our Cross Border Business Solution services with our Cloud Accounting Solution. 




	 





	Record
	Management Services





	 




	We
	believe that it is important to establish a records management solution across the enterprises that offers our clients a convenient
	and cost effective way to store, categorize and access business records. We offer our clients a cloud record management system
	to store our future clients’ business information and supplement our cloud product with general bookkeeping services. We
	intend to use third party accounting software that has been developed in accordance with the accounting principles in Hong Kong
	and is compliant with tax legislation to deal with day-to-day accounts to ensure that all bookkeeping records are clear and accurate.
	In addition, we plan to provide a general ledger to a client as well as spreadsheet, income statements, cash flow statements,
	and balance sheets. We anticipate that by using our record management solutions, our clients will be able to share and make decision
	quickly and effectively without wasting valuable resources and becoming more competitive.




	 





	Accounting
	Outsourcing Services





	 




	We
	hope to develop a network of relationships with professional firms from Hong Kong, Malaysia and China that can provide company
	secretarial, business centers and virtual offices, book-keeping, tax compliance and planning, payroll management, business valuation,
	and or wealth management services to our prospective clients. We also hope to include accounting firms within this network so
	that they can provide general accounting, financial evaluation and advisory services to our prospective clients that are local
	to such professional firm. We hope that firms within our professional network will refer to us their international clients that
	may need our book-keeping, payroll, company secretarial and tax compliance services. We believe that this accounting outsourcing
	service arrangement will be beneficial to our prospective clients by providing a convenient, one-stop firm for their local and
	international business and financial compliance and governance needs.




	 




	We
	also plan to engage with strategic partners to assist us in accounting outsourcing services, including Netiquette Software, Xero,
	and Feng Office.






	  





	Cloud
	Accounting Solution





	 




	We
	intend to develop a cloud accounting system, which can assist small business clients to manage their books and financial records.
	The cloud accounting system we intend to develop is a device related to book-keeping and accounting through an Internet based
	platform. It is a program for organizational finance, which we anticipate will allow users to perform accounting-related functions
	such as making records of money received by a company, billing a company’s clients, managing the inventory, and recording
	the financial transactions through the cloud platform.




	 




	Besides
	recording a company’s financial data, the cloud accounting system we expect to develop will be able to assist clients to
	create the financial statements such as the balance sheets, the income statements and statements of cash flow. It is our belief
	that the cloud based system will enable the potential clients to keep track of their income and expense, create invoices, manage
	banking accounts, and prepare monthly accounts for management’s review. The designed functions of this system will include
	reminding the future clients to properly record assets or revenues for its business therefore assisting them to more effectively
	and economically prepare financial statements and monitor the financial performance of their businesses. We expect that the
	potential clients could scale at the speed of their businesses, and expand their businesses into larger markets with the assistance
	of cloud accounting system.




	 




	We
	hope to begin development of our cloud accounting system by the 3 

	rd 

	quarter of 2016. We may also seek potential
	partners to jointly develop the cloud accounting system to develop the business.




	 





	Our
	Service Rates





	 




	There
	are two types of fees we expect to charge based on the services described above. One is project-based fees, where we will charge
	10% -25% of the revenues of the projects that are completed by assistance of our services. Such projects include the transaction
	projects, the contract compliance projects, and the business planning projects. Another type of fee is a flat rate fee or fixed
	fee where our professionals provides expertise to our clients and charge the fees based on the estimation of complexity and timing
	of the project. For example, for the cross-border business solution, we plan to charge our client a monthly fixed fee.

	Our
	Venture Capital Business Segment





	 





	Venture
	Capital Investment





	 




	As
	a result of our acquisition of Greenpro Venture Capital Limited in September 30, 2015, we entered the venture capital business
	in Hong Kong with a focus on companies located in Asia and Southeast Asia including Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, Thailand, and
	Singapore. Our venture capital business segment will focus on establishing a business incubator for start-up and high growth companies
	to support them during their critical growth periods and investing in select start-up and high growth companies.




	 




	We
	believe that a company’s life cycle can be divided as seed stage, start up stage, expansion stage, mature stage and decline
	stage.




	 






	 




	●




	Seed
	stage: Financing is needed for research, assets and the development of an initial business concept before the business has
	reached the start-up phase. The company usually has relatively low costs in developing the business idea. The ownership model
	is considered and implemented.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Start-up
	stage: Financing is needed for product development and initial marketing. Firms in this phase may be in the process of setting
	up a business or they might have been in the business for short time, but not sold their products commercially. In this phase,
	cost are increasing affectedly because of e.g. product development, market research and the need of recruiting personnel.
	Low levels of revenues are starting to generate.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	 


	●




	Expansion
	stage: Financing is needed for the growth and expansion. Capital may be used to finance increased production capacity, product
	or market development or hire additional personnel. In the early expansion phase, sales and production increase but there
	is not yet any profit. In the later expansion stage, the business typically needs extra capital in addition to organically
	generated profit, for further development, marketing or product development.






	 




	We
	expect that most of a company’s funding needs will occur during the first three stages.




	 




	We
	expect our business incubators to provide valuable support to young, emerging growth and potential high growth companies at critical
	junctures of their development. For example, our incubators will offer office space at a below market rental rate. We will also
	provide our expertise, business contacts, introductions and other resources to assist their development and growth. Depending
	on each individual circumstance, we may also take an active advisory role of our portfolio companies including board representation,
	strategic marketing, corporate governance, and capital structuring. We believe that the future growth of those prospects start-up
	companies will be our potential investment opportunities




	 




	In
	addition to our business incubator, we have also invested cash and cash equivalents in companies that we believe have high growth
	potential in exchange for an equity position in such companies. As of the date of this annual report, we have made investments
	into following companies:

	Our
	business processes for our investing side of the venture capital business segment are as follows:




	 






	 




	●




	Step
	1. Generating Deal Flow: We expect to actively search for entrepreneurial firms and to generate deal flow through our business
	incubator and the personal contacts of our executive team. We also anticipate that entrepreneurs will approach us for financing.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Step
	2. Investment Decision: We will evaluate, examine and engage in due diligence of a prospective portfolio company, including
	but not limited to product/services viability, market potential and integrity as well as capability of the management. After
	that both parties arrive at an agreed value for the deal. Following that is a process of negotiation, which if successful,
	ends with capital transformation and restructuring.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Step
	3. Business Development and Value Adding: In addition to capital contribution, we expect to provide expertise, knowledge and
	relevant business contacts to the company.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Step
	4. Exit: There are several ways to exit an investment in a company. Common exits are:






	 




	● IPO
	(Initial Public Offering): The venture’s shares are offered in a public sale on an established securities market. 




	 




	●
	Trade sale (Acquisition): The entire venture is sold to another company. 




	 




	●
	Secondary sale: The venture capital firm’s sell their part of the venture’s shares only. 




	 




	●
	Buyback or MBO: Either the entrepreneur or the management of the firm buys back the venture capital company’s shares of
	the firm. 




	 




	●
	Reconstruction, liquidation or bankruptcy: If the project fails the venture capital firms will restructure or close down the venture. 




	 




	Our
	objective for equity investors is to achieve a superior rate of return through the eventual and timely disposal of investments.
	We expect to look for businesses that meet the following criteria:




	 






	 




	●




	high
	growth prospects






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	ambitious
	teams






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	viability
	of product or service






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	experienced
	management






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	ability
	to convert plans into reality






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	justification
	of venture capital investment and investment criteria







	 






	Our
	Venture Capital Related Education and Support Services.





	 




	In
	addition to providing venture capital services through GPVC, we also hope to provide educational and support services that we
	believe will be synergistic with our venture capital business. Specifically, we hope to arrange one or more seminars called the
	CEO & Business Owners Strategic Session (CBOSS) for business owners who are interested in the following:




	 






	 




	●




	Developing
	the business globally






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Expanding
	business with increase capital funds






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Creating
	a sustainable SME business model






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Accelerating
	the growth of the business






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Increasing
	company cash flow significantly






	 




	The
	objective the CBOSS seminar is to educate the Chief Executive Officer or business owner on how to acquire “smart capital”
	and the considerations involved. We expect the seminar to include an introduction to the basic concepts of “smart capital,”
	“wealth and value creation,” recommendation and planning and similar topics. We believe that this seminar will synergistically
	support our venture capital business segment.




	 




	We
	intend to provide these educational services through our subsidiary Greenpro Global Advisory Sdn. Bhd., which was renamed Greenpro
	Capital Village Sdn. Bhd. on September 23, 2015.




	 




	On
	October 1, 2015, QSC Asia Sdn. Bhd., an unaffiliated third party, acquired 49% of Greenpro Capital Village Sdn. Bhd. in consideration
	of $11,000 (RM 49,000) from Greenpro Financial Consulting Limited. Concurrently with such sale, Greenpro Financial Consulting
	Limited transferred 51% of Greenpro Capital Village Sdn. Bhd. to Greenpro Holding Limited, our subsidiary.

	Sales
	and Marketing





	 




	We
	plan to deploy three strategies to accomplish our goal in marketing the brand of Greenpro: leadership, market segmentation, and
	sales management process development. 




	 






	 




	●






	Building
	Brand Image:

	Greenpro’s marketing efforts will focus on building the image
	of our extensive knowledge and




	expertise
	of our professionals and expertise. We intend to conduct the market campaign through media visibility, seminars, webinars,
	and the creation of a wide variety of white papers, newsletters, books, and other information offerings to build the image
	of our professional services.







	 




	 




	 






	 




	●

	 






	Market
	segmentation:

	We plan to devote our marketing resources to the highly measurable and high return on investment tactics
	that specifically target those industries and areas where Greenpro has particularly deep experience and capabilities. These
	efforts typically involve local, regional or national trade show and event sponsorships, targeted direct mail, email, and
	telemarketing campaigns, and practice and industry specific micro-sites, newsletters, etc. in the Asia region.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●

	 






	Social
	Media:

	We plan to begin a social media campaign utilizing blogs, twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn after we secure sufficient
	financing. A targeted campaign will be made to the following groups of clients: law firms, auditing firms, consulting firms,
	small to mid-size enterprises in different industries, including biotechnologies, intellectual property, information technologies
	and real estate.






	 





	Market
	Opportunities





	 




	It
	is our intention to assist our potential clients in preparing their financial statements at a lower cost and to provide security
	based on such financial information since the data is stored on the cloud system. We anticipate a market with growing needs in
	South East Asia. We believe that today there is an increasing need for enterprises in different industries to maximize their performance
	with cost effective methods. We believe our services will create numerous competitive advantages for our potential clients. With
	support from Greenpro, we believe our future clients can focus on developing their businesses and expanding their own client portfolio.




	 




	We
	believe the main drivers for the growth of our business are the products and services together with the resources such as office
	network, professional staff members, and operation tools to make the advisory and consulting business more competitive.




	 





	Customers





	 




	Prior
	to the consummation of the previously described acquisitions, we generated minimal revenue from three clients in Hong Kong in
	the ordinary course of business. The revenue generated related to our assistance on the clients’ company formation and secretary
	services. After the consummation of such acquisitions, we expect to generate revenues from clients located globally including
	those from Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Australia, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Russia, USA, Malta, and
	France.




	 




	We
	currently provide professional business services to small to mid-size companies from various countries and in various industries. We
	also plan to serve as support to professional service providers such as auditing firms and law firms. We also provide various
	professional services to our clients and enable them to focus their resources on their own operational competencies. Depending
	on a client’s size and capabilities, it has the option to choose to utilize one, some or many of the diverse and integrated
	services to be offered by Greenpro. Our services will seek to cover the traditional accounting services bundled with cloud accounting
	solution together with business consulting and advisory. We intend to focus on developing our client base in Hong Kong, China
	and Malaysia.




	 




	Our
	venture capital business segment will initially focus on Hong Kong and Southeast Asia start-ups and high growth companies. We
	hope to generate deal flow through personal contacts of our management team as well as through our business incubator.




	 




	We
	generated net revenues of $2,946,164 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Our venture capital business accounted for
	approximately 55.6% of our net revenue. We are not a party to any long-term agreements with our customers.




	 









	 



	14



	 









	 







	 





	Competition





	 




	Our
	industry is highly competitive. We compete with local and international venture capital, financial advisory and corporate business
	service companies such as Cornerstone Management Group in Hong Kong, CST Tax Advisor in Singapore and Maceda Valencia & Co
	in Philippines that provide services comparable to our Packaged Solution. We also compete with numerous local and international
	financial advisory and corporate business service companies that do not offer our broad range of services but focus on specialized
	areas such as tax planning, cross-border solutions, and the like. Some of our competitors may provide a broader selection of services,
	including investment banking services, which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single company to meet
	all of their financial and business advisory needs. In addition, some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are,
	may have substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do. We believe
	that we compete on the basis of a number of factors, including breadth of service and product offerings, one stop convenience,
	pricing, marketing expertise, service levels, technological capabilities and integration, brand and reputation.




	 





	Intellectual
	Property





	 




	We
	intend to protect our investment in the research and development of our products and technologies. We intend to seek the widest
	possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets,
	trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level
	of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. Currently, our revenue is derived principally from our operations in Hong
	Kong and Malaysia, where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek
	protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.




	 




	We
	intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend protect our trademarks
	against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.




	 




	We
	rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. Our policy is
	to require some of our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. These agreements
	provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s
	relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The
	agreements also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us
	as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements
	will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or
	that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.




	 





	Government
	Regulation





	 




	We
	intend to provide our Package Solution initially in Hong Kong, China and Malaysia, which we believe would welcome outsourcing
	support services. Further, we believe these markets are the central and regional markets for many customers doing cross border
	businesses in Asia. We plan to target those customers from South East Asia doing international business and plan to provide our
	Package Solution to meet their needs. Our planned Packaged Solution will be structured in Hong Kong but services may be outsourced
	to lower cost jurisdictions such as Malaysia, which encourage and welcome outsourcing services.




	 




	The
	following regulations are the applicable laws and regulations that may be applicable to us:




	 





	Hong
	Kong





	 




	Our
	businesses located in Hong Kong are subject to the general laws in Hong Kong governing businesses including labor, occupational
	safety and health, general corporations, intellectual property and other similar laws. Because our website is maintained through
	the server in Hong Kong, we expect that we will be required to comply with the rules of regulations of Hong Kong governing the
	data usage and regular terms of service applicable to our potential customers. As the information of our potential customers is
	preserved in Hong Kong, we will need to comply with the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap 486).




	  




	The
	Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong since 1968. It covers a
	comprehensive range of employment protection and benefits for employees, including Wage Protection, Rest Days, Holidays with Pay,
	Paid Annual Leave, Sickness Allowance, Maternity Protection, Statutory Paternity Leave, Severance Payment, Long Service Payment,
	Employment Protection, Termination of Employment Contract, Protection Against Anti-Union Discrimination.




	 









	 



	15



	 









	 







	 




	An
	employer must also comply with all legal obligations under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, (CAP485). These include
	enrolling all qualifying employees in MPF schemes and making MPF contributions for them. Except for exempt persons, employer should
	enroll both full-time and part-time employees who are at least 18 but under 65 years of age in an MPF scheme within the first
	60 days of employment. The 60-day employment rule does not apply to casual employees in the construction and catering industries.




	 




	We
	are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period).
	Employers and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5% of the employee’s relevant income
	to an MPF scheme, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels. For a monthly-paid employee, the minimum and maximum
	relevant income levels are $7,100 and $30,000 respectively.




	 





	Malaysia





	 




	Our
	businesses located in Malaysia are subject to the general laws in Malaysia governing businesses including labor, occupational
	safety and health, general corporations, intellectual property and other similar laws including the Computer Crime Act 1997 and
	The Copyright (Amendment) Act 1997. We believe that the focus of these laws realize it is an issue of censorship in Malaysia.
	But we believe this issue will not impact our businesses because the censorship focus on media controls and does not relate to
	cloud based technology we plan to use.




	 




	Our
	real estate investments are subject to extensive local, city, county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning,
	subdivision, utilities and water quality as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection
	of endangered species and their habitats. Such regulation may result in higher than anticipated administrative and operational
	costs.




	 





	China





	 




	A
	portion of our acquired businesses is located in China and subject to the general laws in China governing businesses including
	labor, occupational safety and health, general corporations, intellectual property and other similar laws.




	 





	Employment
	Contracts





	 




	The
	Employment Contract Law was promulgated by the National People’s Congress’ Standing Committee on June 29, 2007 and
	took effect on January 1, 2008. The Employment Contract Law governs labor relations and employment contracts (including the entry
	into, performance, amendment, termination and determination of employment contracts) between domestic enterprises (including foreign-invested
	companies), individual economic organizations and private non-enterprise units (collectively referred to as the “employers”)
	and their employees.




	 




	a.
	Execution of employment contracts




	 




	Under
	the Employment Contract Law, an employer is required to execute written employment contracts with its employees within one month
	from the commencement of employment. In the event of contravention, an employee is entitled to receive double salary for the period
	during which the employer fails to execute an employment contract. If an employer fails to execute an employment contract for
	more than 12 months from the commencement of the employee’s employment, an employment contract would be deemed to have been
	entered into between the employer and employee for a non-fixed term.




	 




	b.
	Right to non-fixed term contracts




	 




	Under
	the Employment Contract Law, an employee may request for a non-fixed term contract without an employer’s consent to renew.
	In addition, an employee is also entitled to a non-fixed term contract with an employer if he has completed two fixed term employment
	contracts with such employer; however, such employee must not have committed any breach or have been subject to any disciplinary
	actions during his employment. Unless the employee requests to enter into a fixed term contract, an employer who fails to enter
	into a non-fixed term contract pursuant to the Employment Contract Law is liable to pay the employee double salary from the date
	the employment contract is renewed.




	 




	c.
	Compensation for termination or expiry of employment contracts




	 




	Under
	the Employment Contract Law, employees are entitled to compensation upon the termination or expiry of an employment contract.
	Employees are entitled to compensation even in the event the employer (i) has been declared bankrupt; (ii) has its business license
	revoked; (iii) has been ordered to cease or withdraw its business; or (iv) has been voluntarily liquidated. Where an employee
	has been employed for more than one year, the employee will be entitled to such compensation equivalent to one month’s salary
	for every completed year of service. Where an employee has employed for less than one year, such employee will be deemed to have
	completed one full year of service.

	d.
	Trade union and collective employment contracts




	 




	Under
	the Employment Contract Law, a trade union may seek arbitration and litigation to resolve any dispute arising from a collective
	employment contract; provided that such dispute failed to be settled through negotiations. The Employment Contract Law also permits
	a trade union to enter into a collective employee contract with an employer on behalf of all the employees.




	 




	Where
	a trade union has not been formed, a representative appointed under the recommendation of a high-level trade union may execute
	the collective employment contract. Within districts below county level, collective employment contracts for industries such as
	those engaged in construction, mining, food and beverage and those from the service sector, etc., may be executed on behalf of
	employees by the representatives from the trade union of each respective industry. Alternatively, a district-based collective
	employment contract may be entered into.




	 




	As
	a result of the Employment Contract Law, all of our employees have executed standard written employment agreements with us. We
	have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulties in recruiting staff for our operations.




	 




	On
	October 28, 2010, the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the PRC Social Insurance Law, which became effective
	on July 1, 2011. In accordance with the PRC Social Insurance Law, the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social
	Security Fund and other relevant laws and regulations, China establishes a social insurance system including basic pension insurance,
	basic medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance. An employer shall pay
	the social insurance for its employees in accordance with the rates provided under relevant regulations and shall withhold the
	social insurance that should be assumed by the employees. The authorities in charge of social insurance may request an employer’s
	compliance and impose sanctions if such employer fails to pay and withhold social insurance in a timely manner. Under the Regulations
	on the Administration of Housing Fund effective in 1999, as amended in 2002, PRC companies must register with applicable housing
	fund management centers and establish a special housing fund account in an entrusted bank. Both PRC companies and their employees
	are required to contribute to the housing funds.




	 




	The
	Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security promulgated the Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch on January 24, 2014. The
	Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch, which became effective on March 1, 2014, sets forth that labor dispatch should only be applicable
	to temporary, auxiliary or substitute positions. Temporary positions shall mean positions subsisting for no more than six months,
	auxiliary positions shall mean positions of non-major business that serve positions of major businesses, and substitute positions
	shall mean positions that can be held by substitute employees for a certain period of time during which the employees who originally
	hold such positions are unable to work as a result of full-time study, being on leave or other reasons. The Interim Provisions
	further provides that, the number of the dispatched workers of an employer shall not exceed 10% of its total workforce, and the
	total workforce of an employer shall refer to the sum of the number of the workers who have executed labor contracts with the
	employer and the number of workers who are dispatched to the employer.




	 





	Foreign
	Exchange Control and Administration





	 




	Foreign
	exchange in China is primarily regulated by:




	 






	 




	● 




	The
	Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), or the Administration Rules.






	 




	Under
	the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, if documents certifying the purposes of the conversion of RMB into foreign currency
	are submitted to the relevant foreign exchange conversion bank, the RMB will be convertible for current account items, including
	the distribution of dividends, interest and royalties payments, and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion
	of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loans, securities investment and repatriation of investment, however,
	is subject to the approval of SAFE or its local counterpart.




	 




	Under
	the Administration Rules for the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange, foreign-invested enterprises may only buy,
	sell and/or remit foreign currencies at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial
	documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from SAFE or its local counterpart.




	 




	As
	an offshore holding company with a PRC subsidiary, we may (i) make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, (ii)
	establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, (iii) make loans to our PRC subsidiaries
	or consolidated affiliated entities, or (iv) acquire offshore entities with business operations in China in offshore transactions.
	However, most of these uses are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example:




	 






	 




	●





	capital
	contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, whether existing or newly established ones, must
	be approved by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts;







	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	loans
	by us to our PRC subsidiaries, each of which is a foreign-invested enterprise, to finance
	their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE or its
	local branches; and







	 




	 




	 






	 




	●





	loans
	by us to our consolidated affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities, must
	be approved by the National Development and Reform Commission and must also be registered
	with SAFE or its local branches.







	 









	 



	17



	 









	 







	 




	On
	August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues concerning the Improvement of the Administration
	of Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or “Circular 142”. On March 30,
	2015, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Concerning Reform of the Administrative Approaches
	to Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or “Circular 19”, which became effective
	on June 1, 2015, to regulate the conversion by foreign invested enterprises, or FIEs, of foreign currency into Renminbi by
	restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. Circular 19 requires that Renminbi converted from the foreign currency-dominated
	capital of a FIE shall be managed under the Accounts for FX settlement and pending payment. The expenditure scope of such Account
	includes: expenditure within the business scope, payment of funds for domestic equity investment and Renminbi deposits, repayment
	of the Renminbi loans after completed utilization and so forth. A FIE shall truthfully use its capital by itself within the business
	scope and shall not, directly or indirectly, use its capital or Renminbi converted from the foreign currency-dominated capital
	for (i) expenditure beyond its business scope or expenditure prohibited by laws or regulations, (ii) disbursing Renminbi
	entrusted loans (unless permitted under its business scope), repaying inter-corporate borrowings (including third-party advance)
	and repaying Renminbi bank loans already refinanced to any third party. Where a FIE, other than a foreign-invested investment
	company, foreign-invested venture capital enterprise or foreign-invested equity investment enterprise, makes domestic equity investment
	by transferring its capital in the original currency, it shall obey the current provisions on domestic re-investment. Where such
	a FIE makes domestic equity investment by its Renminbi conversion, the invested enterprise shall first go through domestic re-investment
	registration and open a corresponding Accounts for FX settlement and pending payment, and the FIE shall thereafter transfer the
	conversion to the aforesaid Account according to the actual amount of investment. In addition, according to the Regulations of
	the People’s Republic of China on Foreign Exchange Administration, which became effective on August 5, 2008, the use
	of foreign exchange or Renminbi conversion may not be changed without authorization.




	 




	Violations
	of the applicable circulars and rules may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the Foreign
	Exchange Administration Regulations.




	 




	In
	light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding
	companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary
	government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans to our PRC subsidiary or future capital contributions
	by us to our PRC subsidiary. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds
	we expect to receive from this offering and the concurrent private placement and to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations
	may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.




	 





	Seasonality





	 




	Our
	businesses are not subject to seasonality.





	Insurance





	 




	We
	do not current maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance. As our business matures, we expect to obtain such
	insurance in accordance customary industry practices in Malaysia, Hong Kong and China, as applicable.

	Company Overview






	 




	Greenpro
	Capital Corp. (the “Company” or “Greenpro”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 19, 2013
	with a fiscal year end of December 31. Our business and registered office is located at Suite 2201, 22/F., Malaysia Building 50
	Gloucester Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong. Our website is at:

	http://www.greenprocapital.com

	. Information contained on our website
	is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
	We continue to provide cloud accounting solutions, cross-border business solutions, record management services to small and mid-size
	businesses located in Asia, with an initial focus on Hong Kong, Malaysia and China.




	 




	Greenpro
	provides a range of services as a package solution (the “Package Solution”) to our clients. It is our intention to
	develop a “Package Solution,” which will build a cloud solution into traditional accounting services. By using a Package
	Solution, we believe that our clients can reduce their business costs and improve their revenues.




	 




	In
	addition to our business solution services, we also operate a venture capital business through Greenpro Venture Capital Limited,
	an Anguilla corporation. One of our venture capital business segments is focused on establishing a business incubator for start-up
	and high growth companies to support them during their critical growth periods and investing in select start-up and high growth
	companies. Our venture capital business is focused on companies located in Asia and Southeast Asia including Hong Kong, Malaysia,
	China, Thailand, and Singapore. Another one of our venture capital business segments is focused on rental activities of commercial
	properties, the sale of investment properties.




	 




	As
	of January 15, 2015, Greenpro obtained a trading symbol for the common stocks from FINRA. The Common stock can be quoted and traded
	in the over-the-counter market. As of April 6, 2015, Greenpro is verified for trading on the OTCQB® Venture Marketplace.




	 




	On
	May 6, 2015, Greenpro with approval of a majority of the Company’s shareholders, changed its name from Greenpro, Inc. to
	Greenpro Capital Corp. The board of directors believes that a change of the Company’s name to “Greenpro Capital Corp.”
	will facilitate the Company’s efforts to re-brand itself to develop and enhance its business.




	 




	Effective
	July 21, 2015, the Board of Directors of Greenpro approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year end from October 31 to
	December 31. The change is intended to improve comparability with industry peers. 




	 




	On
	July 29, 2015, Greenpro acquired its related company, Greenpro Resources Limited which provides business consulting and advisory
	services and generates income through the subsidiaries of Greenpro Resources Limited. Greenpro Resources Sdn. Bhd, a wholly owned
	subsidiary of Greenpro Resources Limited, holds real estate in Malaysia as investment properties and generates rental income.




	 




	On
	July 31, 2015, Greenpro acquired 100% shareholding of A&G International Limited, Falcon Secretaries Limited, Ace Corporate
	Services Limited, Shenzhen Falcon Financial Consulting Limited and 60% shareholding of Yabez (Hong Kong) Company Limited. For

	Revenues,

	Total
	revenue was $2,946,164 and $576,330 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 respectively. The increase was
	primarily due to $1,637,548 received from the sale of properties, an increase in service income of $712,810 and an increase in
	rental income of $19,476.




	  





	Rental
	Income





	 




	Revenue
	from rental was $51,464 and $31,988 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 respectively. It was derived principally
	from the leasing of properties in Malaysia and Hong Kong. We believe our rental income will be quite stable in near future.




	 





	Service
	Income





	 




	Revenue
	from the provision of services was $1,257,152 and $544,342 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 respectively.
	It was derived principally from provision of business consulting and advisory services and company secretarial, accounting and
	financial review. We experienced an increase in service income as a result of our acquisitions of Greenpro Financial Consulting
	Limited, A&G Group, F&A Group and Yabez. We expect the service income will be increased in near future after integration
	of clienteles and increased focus on high-end services.

	Sale
	of properties





	 




	Revenue
	from the sale of properties was $1,637,548 for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was derived from the sale of certain commercial
	properties located in Hong Kong. During the same period ended December 31, 2015, the Company also purchased property located at
	Tuen Mun, Hong Kong.




	 




	As
	opportunities permit, management expects to continue to purchase and sell commercial real estate in the near future. Accordingly,
	we expect revenue and costs attributable to the sale of properties to fluctuate on a going forward basis.




	 





	Cost
	of Revenues







	 








	Total
	cost of revenues was $1,852,865 and $300,538 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 respectively. The increase
	was primarily due to the attributable to the trading of real estate business.




	 




	The
	overall gross profit for the Company was $1,093,299 and $275,792

	for the year
	ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenues was 37.1% and 47.9%
	for the same period ended December 31, 2015, and 2014. The decrease was due to the sale of properties with lower profit margin
	ratio.





	 





	Cost
	of rental





	 






	Cost
	of revenue on rental was $38,354 and $45,146 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 respectively. It includes
	the costs associated with government rent and rates, repairs and maintenance, property insurance, depreciation and other related
	administrative costs.




	 





	Cost
	of service





	 




	Costs
	of revenue on provision of services was $506,306 and 255,392 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 respectively.
	It primarily consists of employee compensation and related payroll benefits, company formation cost and other professional fees.
	We experienced an increase in service income as a result of our acquisitions of Greenpro Financial Consulting Limited, A&G
	Group, F&A Group and Yabez. We expect the cost of service will be increased aligned with the service income.




	 





	Cost
	of properties sold





	 




	Cost
	of revenue on properties sold was $1,308,205 for the year ended December 31, 2015. It primary consists the purchase price of property
	located at Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, legal fees, improvement costs to the building structure, and other acquisition costs. 




	 




	As
	opportunities permit, management expects to continue to purchase and sell commercial real estate in the near future. Accordingly,
	we expect revenue and costs attributable to the sale of properties to fluctuate on a going forward basis.




	 





	Operating
	Expenses





	 





	General
	and administrative expenses





	 






	General
	and administrative expenses was $1,382,424 and $368,731 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 respectively.
	The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increase in directors’ remuneration and housing
	allowance, salary, office rent, professional and legal fees. We expect out G&A to continue to increase as we integrate our
	business acquisitions, expand our offices into Thailand and Australia, and deepen our existing businesses.




	 





	Other
	Expenses





	 




	Other
	expenses were $52,371 and $40,732 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 respectively. The increase was primarily
	due to the share of loss on investments in unconsolidated entities and interest expense.




	 





	Attributable
	to non-controlling interest





	 



	The

	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates

	 




	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
	our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and
	related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant
	to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial
	condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our
	financial condition and results of operations and require management’s subjective or complex judgment, often as a result
	of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
	Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the
	possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments. We believe
	the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements.




	 




	●
	Inventory – finished property






	 




	Inventory
	– finished property represents a multi-unit property developed for resale on a unit by unit basis. Inventory is stated at
	cost unless the inventory is determined to be impaired in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. The
	cost of inventory – finished property includes the purchase price of property, legal fees, improvement costs to the building
	structure, and other

	acquisition costs. Project wide costs such as property acquisition
	and certain development costs are allocated to the specific units based upon their relative fair value before construction. All
	property is finished and ready for sale.





	  




	●
	Investment Property




	 




	Investment
	Property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
	on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational and after
	taking into account their estimated residual values:

	Intangible assets





	 






	Intangible
	assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets represented the registration costs of trade marks registered
	in Hong Kong, the PRC, and Malaysia, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful live of ten year. Intangible assets
	acquired in business combinations are provisionally considered customer lists amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful
	live of five year.




	 




	The Company follows ASC Topic
	350 in accounting for intangible assets, which requires impairment losses to be recorded when indicators of impairment are present
	and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. The
	Company’s policy is to perform its annual impairment testing for its intangible assets on December 31, of each fiscal
	year.




	 




	●
	Goodwill




	 




	Goodwill is
	the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
	a business combination. With the provision of ASC 350

	“Goodwill and Other”

	, goodwill is not amortized,
	rather it is tested for impairment annually, and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances
	change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying
	amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and would be measured as
	the excess carrying value of goodwill over the derived fair value of goodwill. The Company’s policy is to perform its
	annual impairment testing for its reporting units on December 31, of each fiscal year. 




	 




	●

	Impairment of long-lived assets





	 




	Long-lived
	assets primarily include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360-10-5,
	“

	Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

	”, the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation
	to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such
	as a significant sustained change in the business climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the reporting
	unit level. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss
	is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset. There has been no impairment charge
	for the periods presented.




	 




	●
	Cash value of life insurance




	 




	The
	cash value of life insurance relates to the Company-owned life insurance policies on the general manager and executive
	corporate advisor of the Company, which is stated at the cash surrender value of the contract.




	 




	●
	Investments in unconsolidated entities




	 




	Under
	the equity method of accounting, investments in unconsolidated entities are initially recognized in the consolidated
	balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the Company’s proportionate share of net earnings or losses
	of the entity, distributions received, contributions and certain other adjustments, as appropriate. The Company’s share
	of the income or loss of the unconsolidated entity is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and will increase
	or decrease, as applicable, the carrying value of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated entities on the consolidated
	balance sheet.




	 









	 



	27



	 









	 







	 




	When
	the investment cost in an unconsolidated entity is reduced to zero, the Company records no further losses in its consolidated
	statements of operations unless the Company has an outstanding guarantee obligation or has committed additional funding to the
	entity. When such entity subsequently reports income, the Company will not record its share of such income until it exceeds the
	amount of the Company’s share of losses not previously recognized.




	 




	●
	Comprehensive income




	 




	Comprehensive
	income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances
	from non-owner sources. The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income consists of cumulative foreign currency translation
	adjustments.




	 




	●
	Revenue recognition




	 




	The
	Company recognizes its revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605, “

	Revenue Recognition

	”, upon the delivery of
	its products when: (1) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (2) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (3) there
	are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related accounts receivable is probable.




	 




	(a)
	Rental income




	 




	Revenue
	from rental of leasehold land and buildings are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is
	reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased assets.




	 




	The
	Company leases its commercial office premises in Malaysia and Hong Kong under various non-cancelable operating leases with terms
	of two to three years and renewal options. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded $47,937 in rental revenue,
	based upon its annual rental over the life of the lease under operating lease, using straight-line method.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2015, the Company has the aggregate future minimum rental receivable under the non-cancelable leases over the
	next two years consisted of the followings:

	(b)
	Service income




	 




	Revenue
	from the provision of (i) business consulting and advisory services and (ii) company secretarial, accounting and financial review
	services are recognized when there is (i) an existence of contract or an arrangement (ii) services are rendered, (iii) the service
	price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonable assured.




	 




	(c)
	Sale of properties




	 




	Revenue
	from the sale of properties is recognized at the time each unit is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer.
	Specifically, the Company utilizes the full accrual method where recognition occurs when (i) the collectability of the sales
	price is reasonably assured, (ii) the seller is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale, (iii) the
	initial investment from the buyer is sufficient, and (iv) the Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation
	by transferring control of a promised property to a customer.




	Revenue
	on sales of properties may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for revenue recognition have been met.




	 




	●
	Cost of revenues




	 




	Cost
	of revenue on rental shown on the accompanying statements of operations include costs associated with government rent and rates,
	repairs and maintenance, property insurance, depreciation and other related administrative costs. Property management fee and
	utility expenses are paid directly by tenants. 




	 




	Costs
	of revenue on provision of services primarily consist of employee compensation and related payroll benefits, company formation
	cost and other professional fees directly attributable to cost in related to the services rendered.




	 









	 



	28



	 









	 







	 




	Cost
	of revenues on sale of properties primary consist of the purchase price of property, legal fees, improvement costs to the building
	structure, and other acquisition costs. Selling and advertising costs are expensed as incurred.




	 




	●
	Non-controlling interest




	 




	Non-controlling
	interest represent the capital contribution, income and loss attributable to the shareholders of less than wholly-owned and consolidated
	entities.




	 




	●
	Income taxes




	 




	Income
	taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “

	Income Taxes

	” (“ASC 740”).
	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
	between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
	assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
	temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
	tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.




	 




	ASC
	740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
	uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized
	in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
	Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
	likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
	facts.




	 




	The
	Company conducts major businesses in Hong Kong, Malaysia and China and is subject to tax in its own jurisdiction. As a result
	of its business activities, the Company will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities.




	 




	●
	Foreign currencies translation




	 




	Transactions
	denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
	prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
	currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting
	exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.




	 




	The
	reporting currency of the Company is the United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have
	been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company’s operating subsidiaries maintain their books and record in a local currency,
	Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR”), Renminbi (“RMB”), and Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”), which is also
	the respective functional currencies for each subsidiary as they are the primary currency of the economic environment in which
	each subsidiary operates.




	 




	In
	general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the US$ are translated
	into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “

	Translation of Financial Statement”

	, using the exchange rate
	on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses
	resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other
	comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders’ equity.




	 




	Translation
	of amounts from the local currencies of the Company into US$ has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective
	periods:

	Parties,
	which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly,
	to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions.
	Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.




	 




	●Segment
	reporting




	 




	ASC
	Topic 280, “

	Segment Reporting

	” establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on
	a basis consistent with the Company’s internal organization structure as well as information about geographical areas, business
	segments and major customers in financial statements. The Company operates in two reportable operating segments in Hong Kong,
	China, and Malaysia.




	 




	●
	Fair value of financial instruments




	 




	The
	carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits, prepayments
	and other receivables, accounts payable, receipts in advance, loan from shareholders, amounts due to directors, amount due to
	related companies, amount due to non-controlling interest party, and other payables and accrued liabilities approximate at their
	fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.




	 




	The
	Company follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	” (“ASC
	820-10”), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier
	fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:




	 






	●





	Level
	1

	: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;






	 




	 






	●





	Level
	2

	: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and






	 




	 






	●





	Level
	3

	: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its
	own assumptions






	 




	●
	Recent accounting pronouncements




	 




	In
	May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU
	2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”,
	and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
	the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective
	for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early
	adoption is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update to defer by one year the effective dates
	of its new revenue recognition standard until annual reporting periods beginning after January December 15, 2017 (2018 for calendar-year
	public entities) and interim periods therein.


	Management is currently assessing the
	impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and has not determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.




	 




	In
	June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The pronouncement was issued
	to clarify the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved
	after the requisite service period. The pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The
	adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or
	results of operations.




	 




	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, Disclosure of Uncertainties
	about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” (“ASU 2014-15”), which establishes management’s
	responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and,
	if so, to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term “substantial doubt”
	and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be
	issued. Management will also be required to evaluate and disclose whether its plans alleviate that doubt. The guidance is effective
	for the annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. The Company
	is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company’s financial statement presentation and disclosures.

	In
	January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20) - Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items. ASU
	2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP. As a result, an entity will no longer be required to segregate
	extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations, to separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement,
	net of tax, after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary
	item. However, ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature and
	occur infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not

	The
	disclosure required under this section was previously reported as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, as amended, on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 20, 2016.

	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

	 






	 





	We
	conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
	and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term
	“disclosure controls and procedures”, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange
	Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
	that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
	processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules
	and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
	information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
	and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
	performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation,
	our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of December 31, 2015, that our disclosure controls and procedures
	were not effective. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses
	under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a
	lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in
	ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation
	of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes;
	and (4) lack of internal audit function due to the fact that the Company lacks qualified resources to perform the internal audit
	functions properly and that the scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet to be developed. The aforementioned
	material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as
	of December 31, 2015.




	 




	Management
	believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However,
	management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board
	of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures,
	which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.



	 


	During
	the quarterly report as of September 30, 2015, we did not maintain adequate controls to ensure that purchase accounting was correctly
	applied pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as defined in ASC 805 and related interpretations. Specifically,
	we did not sufficiently allocate the purchase consideration in connection with our acquisition of F&A and Yabez. We considered
	the processes followed to initially account for the acquisition that included assistance from independent valuation consultants
	and the complexities involved in applying the unique circumstances associated with the transaction to the pertinent literature,
	and determined that this significant deficiency did not constitute a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting
	and that the Company’s internal knowledge base and process regarding purchase accounting has now been remediated with heightened
	awareness and further expertise in this area.

	Management’s
	Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting







	 





	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
	13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
	assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management’s
	review and approval of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures
	that:




	 




	1.
	pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
	of our assets;




	 




	2.
	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
	with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management;
	and




	 




	3.
	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets
	that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




	 




	Because
	of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
	of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
	in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	 




	Management
	assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making
	this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
	in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control
	over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls.




	 




	Based
	on this assessment, management has concluded that as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was not
	effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
	for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In an effort to remediate the identified
	material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following
	series of measures:




	 




	We
	have increased our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function, however, we should continue
	to hire one or more personnel for the function. We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives.
	And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting
	in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
	controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available
	to us. We also plan to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process
	to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions, including equity and debt transactions.




	 




	We
	anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the mid of fiscal year 2016. Additionally,
	we plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies in year 2016.




	 




	This
	annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
	control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public
	accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only
	management’s report in this annual report.




	 






	Changes
	in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 







	 





	There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2015, that have materially affected,
	or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	are currently performed by our entire board. We expect to form such committees in the future and anticipate that our independent
	directors will also serve on such committees.




	 




	In
	considering candidates for membership on the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors will take into consideration the needs
	of the Board of Directors and the candidate’s qualifications. The Board of Directors will request such information as:




	 






	 




	●




	The
	name and address of the proposed candidate;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	proposed candidates resume or a listing of his or her qualifications to be a director of the Company;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	A
	description of any relationship that could affect such person’s qualifying as an independent director, including identifying
	all other public company board and committee memberships;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	A
	confirmation of such person’s willingness to serve as a director if selected by the Board of Directors; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Any
	information about the proposed candidate that would, under the federal proxy rules, be required to be included in the Company’s
	proxy statement if such person were a nominee.






	 




	Once
	a person has been identified by the Board of Directors as a potential candidate, the Board of Directors may collect and review
	publicly available information regarding the person to assess whether the person should be considered further. Generally, if the
	person expresses a willingness to be considered and to serve on the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors believes that
	the candidate has the potential to be a good candidate, the Board of Directors would seek to gather information from or about
	the candidate, including through one or more interviews as appropriate and review his or her accomplishments and qualifications
	generally, including in light of any other candidates that the Board of Directors may be considering. The Board of Director’s
	evaluation process does not vary based on whether the candidate is recommended by a shareholder.




	 









	 



	35



	 









	 







	 




	The
	Board of Directors will, from time to time, seek to identify potential candidates for director nominees and will consider potential
	candidates proposed by the Board of Directors and by management of the Company.




	 






	Code
	of Ethics






	 




	Our
	Board of Directors has adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal
	executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. The code addresses, among other things, honesty
	and ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, regulations and policies, including disclosure requirements
	under the federal securities laws, confidentiality, trading on inside information, and reporting of violations of the code. The
	code of ethics is available on the Company’s website at

	www.greenprocapital.com

	.




	 






	Section
	16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance






	 




	Section 16(a)
	of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company’s Directors, executive officers, and persons who
	own more than ten percent (10%) of a registered class of the Company’s equity securities, to file initial reports of ownership
	and reports of changes in ownership of Common Stock and other equity securities of the Company with the SEC. Officers, Directors
	and stockholders holding more than ten percent (10%) of the outstanding capital stock of the Company are required by SEC regulations
	to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.




	 




	Based
	solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations by our officers and directors regarding
	their compliance with applicable reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, we believe that all Section 16(a)
	filing requirements for our executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders were met during the year ended January 3, 2015
	except as follows: Each of Messrs. Lee, Loke and Lertwattanarak and Ms. Chuchottaworn were was late in filing his or her Form
	3s. Messrs. Lee and Loke were also late in filing the required Form 4’s in connection with the acquisition of our securities
	arising from our acquisitions of GRBV, A&G, and GPVC.





	 









	ITEM
	11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION





	 





	Compensation
	Philosophy and Objectives





	 




	Our
	executive compensation philosophy is to create a long-term direct relationship between pay and our performance. Our executive
	compensation program is designed to provide a balanced total compensation package over the executive’s career with us. The
	compensation program objectives are to attract, motivate and retain the qualified executives that help ensure our future success,
	to provide incentives for increasing our profits by awarding executives when corporate goals are achieved and to align the interests
	of executives and long-term stockholders. The compensation package of our named executive officers consists of two main elements:




	 






	 




	1.




	base
	salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market, and that reflects individual performance, retention
	and other relevant considerations; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	2.




	discretionary
	bonus awards payable in cash or shares and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives.






	 





	Process
	for Setting Executive Compensation





	 




	Our
	Board of Directors is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation
	of executives and for monitoring the implementation and results of the compensation philosophy to ensure compensation remains
	competitive, creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value and rewards superior performance. The Board of Directors annually
	reviews and approves for each named executive officer, and particularly with regard to the Chief Executive Officer, all components
	of the executive’s compensation. The Board of Directors may award discretionary bonuses to each of the named executives,
	and reviews and approves the process and factors (including individual and corporate performance measures and actual performance
	versus such measures) used by the Chief Executive Officer to recommend such awards. Additionally, the Board of Directors reviews
	and approves the base salary, equity-incentive awards (if any) and any other special or supplemental benefits of the named executive
	officers.




	 




	The
	Chief Executive Officer periodically provides the Board of Directors with an evaluation of each named executive officer’s
	performance, based on the individual performance goals and objectives developed by the Chief Executive Officer at the beginning
	of the year, as well as other factors. The Board of Directors provides an evaluation for the Chief Executive Officer. These evaluations
	serve as the bases for bonus recommendations and changes in the compensation arrangements of our named executives.




	 









	 



	36



	 









	 








	 






	Our
	Compensation Peer Group





	 




	We
	currently engage in informal market analysis in evaluating our executive compensation arrangements. As the Company and its businesses
	mature, we may retain compensation consultants that will assist us in developing a formal benchmark and selecting a compensation
	peer group of companies similar to us in size or business for the purpose of comparing executive compensation levels.




	 





	Program
	Components





	 




	Our
	executive compensation program consists of the following elements:






	 







	Base
	Salary





	 




	Our
	base salary structure is designed to encourage internal growth, attract and retain new talent, and reward strong leadership that
	will sustain our growth and profitability. The base salary for each named executive officer reflects our past and current operating
	profits, the named executive officer’s individual contribution to our success throughout his career, internal pay equity
	and informal market data regarding comparable positions within similarly situated companies. In determining and setting base salary,
	the Compensation Committee considers all of these factors, though it does not assign specific weights to any factor. The Compensation
	Committee generally reviews the base salary for each named executive officer on an annual basis. For each of our named executive
	officers, we review base salary data internally obtained by the Company for comparable executive positions in similarly situated
	companies to ensure that the base salary rate for each executive is competitive relative to the market.






	 








	Discretionary
	Bonus






	 




	The
	objectives of our bonus awards are to encourage and reward our employees, including the named executive officers, who contribute
	to and participate in our success by their ability, industry, leadership, loyalty or exceptional service and to recruit additional
	executives who will contribute to that success.




	 




	Each
	of our named executive officers is eligible for consideration for a discretionary cash bonus or shares bonus. The Chief Executive
	Officer makes recommendations regarding bonus awards for the named executive officers and the Board of Directors provides the
	bonus recommendation for the Chief Executive Officer. However, the Board of Directors has


	sole
	and final authority and discretion in designating to whom awards are made, the size of the award, if any, and its terms and conditions.
	The bonus recommendation for each of the named executive officers depends on a number of factors, including (i) the performance
	of the Company for the year, (ii) the satisfaction of certain individual and corporate performance measures, and (iii) other
	factors which the Board of Directors may deem relevant. The Company did not award any cash bonuses or shares bonus during fiscal
	year 2015.




	 





	Stock
	Holdings





	 




	The
	Board of Directors recognizes the importance of having a portion of the named executive officers’ compensation be paid in
	the form of equity, to help align the executives’ interests with the interests of the Company’s stockholders. At this
	point, however, the Board of Directors has chosen to emphasize the cash-based portion of our compensation program over a stock
	program because it believes the discretionary nature of the cash-based compensation gives it the needed flexibility to factor
	in and reward the attainment of longer-term goals for the Company and the executives, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.




	 




	Accordingly,
	we encourage executive ownership of our common stock. Methods of supporting ownership include turning to executives to support
	the financing needs of the Company. We believe that this practice achieves the dual goals of meeting the Company’s financing
	needs and aligning our executives’ interests with the interests of our stockholders.




	 




	We
	have not timed nor do we plan to time our release of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the value of
	executive compensation.

	as Directors of the Company.






	 





	Narrative
	Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table





	 




	We
	are parties to a three year employment contract with each of Loke Che Chan, Gilbert, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, and
	director, and Mr. Lee Chong Kuang, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director. Each employment agreement commenced September
	1, 2014, and will expire August 31, 2017. Under the terms of the agreements, each of Messrs. Loke and Lee will receive a monthly
	salary equal to $8,000, and a monthly housing allowance of $2,000, both which may also be payable in Hong Kong Dollars. From the
	second year of employment, the monthly salary is increased to $13,000, and a monthly housing allowance of $2,000 and entitled
	to an additional month’s salary as a result of the acquisition of the businesses under the common control of Messrs. Loke
	and Lee. In addition, each of Messrs. Loke and Lee is entitled to receive an additional 864,000 shares of our common stock upon
	the expiration of this agreement, based upon a $0.50 per share price. However, Messrs. Loke and Lee agreed to waive the additional
	864,000 shares as stated in the employment contract. Messrs. Loke and Lee are entitled to reimbursement for reasonable travel
	and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their services on our behalf. The employment agreements also contain
	normal and customary terms relating to confidentiality, indemnification, nonsolicitation and ownership of intellectual property.




	 




	The
	foregoing descriptions of the employment agreements of Messrs. Loke and Lee are summaries only and are qualified in their entirety
	by copies of their employment agreements filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated
	herein by reference.

	Year-End Table above, there are no options, warrants or convertible securities outstanding. At no time during the last fiscal
	year with respect to any of any of our executive officers was there:

	outstanding option or other equity-based award repriced or otherwise materially modified

	Compensation
	of Directors





	 




	During
	our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we did not provide compensation to our directors for serving as our director. We currently
	have no formal plan for compensating our director for his services in his capacity as director, although we may elect to issue
	stock options or provide cash compensation to such person from time to time in the future. Directors are entitled to reimbursement
	for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of our board of directors.
	Our board of directors may award special remuneration to any director undertaking any special services on our behalf other than
	services ordinarily required of a director.




	 





	Compensation
	Risk Management






	 





	The
	Compensation Committee collaborated with our Board of directors and human resources staff to conduct an assessment of potential
	risks that may arise from our compensation programs. Based on this assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that our policies
	and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking that would be reasonably likely to have material adverse
	effect on the Company. The assessment included our cash incentive programs, which awards non-executives with cash bonuses for
	punctuality. Our compensation programs are substantially identical among business units, corporate functions and global locations

	ITEM
	13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE






	 





	Except
	as set forth below, we have not been a party to any transaction since July 19, 2013 (our inception), in which the amount involved
	in the transaction exceeded or will exceed the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets as at the
	year-end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial holders of
	more than 5% of our capital stock, or any immediate family member of, or person sharing the household with, any of these individuals,
	had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.




	 




	Our
	policy is that a contract or transaction either between the Company and a director, or between a director and another company
	in which he is financially interested is not necessarily void or void-able if the relationship or interest is disclosed or known
	to the board of directors and the stockholders are entitled to vote on the issue, or if it is fair and reasonable to our company.




	 





	Transactions
	with Mr. Lee, our Chief Executive Officer and/or Mr. Loke, our Chief Financial Officer





	 




	In
	August 2013, the Company issued two 8% Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) to our Chief Executive Officer,
	Lee Chong Kuang and our Chief Financial Officer, Loke Che Chan, Gilbert (the “Holders”), in the principal amount of
	$41,250 for each Note, pursuant to certain Securities Purchase Agreements dated August 12, 2013. The Notes were convertible into
	the Company’s Common Stock at the Holders’ election at a conversion price of $.00825 per share. On August 31, 2014,
	the maturity date of the Notes, the Holders elected to convert $41,250 of the principle sum of the Note into 5,000,000 shares
	of common stock of the Company for each note, for an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. 




	 




	As
	of June 30, 2015, we have advanced $1,197,352 to a related company controlled by the directors of the Company, Lee Chong Kuang
	and Loke Che Chan, Gilbert, for the purpose of business development, which bears no interest and is payable upon demand. The related
	company financial statement has been consolidated into the Company financial statements, after acquisition on September 2015.




	 




	On
	July 31, 2015, GRNQ and Ms. Yap Pei Ling, the sole shareholder of A&G International Limited, a Belize corporation (“A&G”),
	and spouse of Lee Chong Kuang, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement
	(the “A&G Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which GRNQ agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding securities
	of A&G. As consideration therefor, GRNQ issued Ms. Yap 1,842,000 restricted shares of GRNQ’s common stock, representing
	an aggregate purchase price of $957,840 based on the average closing price of the ten trading days preceding July 31, 2015 of
	$0.52 per share. The purchase price was determined based on the existing business value generated from A&G.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2014, the Company received $1,032 in advisory income from CGN Nanotech Inc. Loke Che Chan, Gilbert, our Chief
	Financial Officer, Secretary and director, is the Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary, and director of CGN Nanotech
	Inc. Greenpro Venture Capital Limited, an investment holding of the Company, holds approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding
	securities of CGN Nanotech Inc.

	Transactions
	with Mr. Lertwattanarak and Ms. Chuchottaworn, our Directors





	 




	During
	the six months period ended June 30, 2015, and prior to their appointment to our Board of Directors on October 18, 2015, Mr. Thanawat
	Lertwattanarak and Ms. Srirat Chuchottaworn advanced collectively $1,171,000 to the Company, which bears no interest and is payable
	upon demand, for the purpose of business development. 




	 




	In
	July 2015, the Company issued two 8% Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) to Mr.Thanawat Lertwattanarak and
	Ms. Srirat Chuchottaworn (the “Holders”), in the principal amount of $585,500 for each Note, pursuant to certain Securities
	Purchase Agreements dated July 10, 2015. The Notes were convertible into the Company’s Common Stock at the Holders’
	election at a conversion price of $1 per share. On August 31, 2015, the Holders elected to convert $585,500 of the principle sum
	of the Note into 585,500 shares of common stock of the Company for each note, for an aggregate of 1,171,000 shares of our common
	stock.




	 




	We
	believe that all of these related party transactions are generally transacted in an arm-length basis at the current market value
	in the normal course of business.




	 





	Director
	Independence





	 




	We
	have adopted standards for director independence that correspond to NASDAQ listing standards and SEC rules. The NASDAQ independence
	definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years,
	one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings
	with us. To be considered independent, the Board must affirmatively determine that neither the director, nor any member of his
	or her immediate family, has had any direct or indirect material relationship with the Company within the previous three years.




	 




	The
	Board considered relationships, transactions and/or arrangements with each of the directors and concluded that none of the non-employee
	directors, or any of his or her immediate family members, has any relationship with us that would impair his or her independence.
	The Board has determined that each of Hee Chee Keong, Shum Albert and Chin Kiew Kwong qualifies as an independent director under
	applicable NASDAQ listing standards and SEC rules.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM






	 






	To
	the Board of Directors






	Greenpro
	Capital Corp.






	Suite
	2201, 22/F., Malaysia Building,






	50
	Gloucester Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong





	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Greenpro Capital Corp. (the "Company") as of December 31,
	2015 and December 31, 2014, and their related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash
	flows for the two month period from November 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 and for year ended December 31, 2015. These consolidated
	financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
	these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements of the Company as of October 31, 2014 and
	for the year then ended were audited by other auditors, whose report dated January 23, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion
	on those financial statements.




	 




	We
	conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
	are free of material misstatement. The Company was not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
	control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
	designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
	effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
	also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
	overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
	of the Company as of December 31, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
	As discussed in Note 2, the Company has recurring losses from operations and accumulated deficit for both years. These conditions,
	among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning
	these matters are also described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do
	not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	GREENPRO
	CAPITAL CORP.










	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	FOR
	THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014






	(Currency
	expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))






	 






	NOTE
	1 – ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND





	 




	Greenpro,
	Inc. (the “Company” or “GRNQ”) was incorporated on July 19, 2013 in the state of Nevada. On May 6, 2015,
	the Company changed its name to Greenpro Capital Corp. The Company currently operates and provides a wide range of business solution
	services varying from cloud system resolution, financial consulting service and corporate accounting services to small and mid-size
	businesses located in Asia, with an initial focus in Hong Kong, China, and Malaysia. The Company’s comprehensive range of
	services cover cloud accounting solutions, cross-border business solutions, record management services, and accounting outsourcing
	services.




	 




	In
	addition to our business solution services, we also operate a venture capital business through Greenpro Venture Capital Limited,
	an Anguilla corporation. One of our venture capital business segments is focused on establishing a business incubator for start-up
	and high growth companies to support them during their critical growth periods and investing in select start-up and high growth
	companies. Our venture capital business is focused on companies located in Asia and Southeast Asia including Hong Kong, Malaysia,
	China, Thailand, and Singapore. Another one of our venture capital business segments is focused on rental activities of commercial
	properties, the sale of investment properties.




	 




	On
	July 29, 2015, the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Greenpro Resources Limited
	(“GRBV”), a company incorporated in British Virgin Islands, and the stockholders of GRBV to purchase 100% of the issued
	and outstanding shares and the assets of GRBV. Pursuant to the Agreement, GRNQ agreed to issue 9,070,000 shares of its restricted
	common stock at $0.35 per share to the stockholders of GRBV and pay $25,500 in cash, representing an aggregate purchase consideration
	of $3,200,000. Mr. Lee Chong Kuang and Mr. Loke Che Chan, Gilbert, the directors of the Company, are the stockholders and directors
	of GRBV each with 50% shareholdings.




	 




	On
	July 31, 2015, the Company further entered into various Sale and Purchase Agreements to purchase the following companies:




	 






	(i)




	100%
	of the issued and outstanding shares and the assets of A&G International Limited (“A&G”), a company incorporated
	in Belize. GRNQ agreed to issue 1,842,000 shares of its restricted common stock at $0.52 per share to the stockholder of A&G,
	representing an aggregate purchase consideration of $957,840. Ms. Yap Pei Ling, the sole stockholder and director of A&G,
	is the spouse of the director of the Company.






	 




	 






	(ii)




	100%
	of the issued and outstanding shares and the assets of Falcon Secretaries Limited, Ace Corporate Services Limited, and Shenzhen
	Falcon Financial Consulting Limited (collectively refer as “F&A”). GRNQ agreed to issue 2,080,200 shares of
	its restricted common stock at $0.52 per share to the stockholder of F&A, representing an aggregate purchase consideration
	of $1,081,740. Ms. Chen Yan Hong, an independent third party, is the sole stockholder of F&A.






	 




	 






	(iii)




	60%
	of the issued and outstanding shares and the assets of Yabez (Hong Kong) Company Limited (“Yabez”), a company
	incorporated in Hong Kong. GRNQ agreed to issue 486,171 shares of its restricted common stock at $0.52 per share to the stockholders
	of Yabez, representing an aggregate purchase consideration of $252,808. Mr. Cheng Chi Ho and Ms. Wong Kit Yi, both are independent
	third parties, are the stockholders of Yabez with 51% and 49% of shareholdings, respectively.

	GREENPRO
	CAPITAL CORP.






	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	FOR
	THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014






	(Currency
	expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))





	 




	On
	September 30, 2015, the Company further entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement to purchase the following company:




	 








	(iv)




	100%
	of the issued and outstanding shares and the assets of Greenpro Venture Capital Limited (“GPVC”), a company incorporated
	in Anguilla. GRNQ agreed to issue 13,260,000 shares of its restricted common stock at $0.60 per share to the stockholders
	of GPVC and pay $6,000 in cash, representing an aggregate purchase consideration of $7,962,000. Mr. Lee Chong Kuang and Mr.
	Loke Che Chan, Gilbert, the directors of the Company, are the stockholders and directors of GPVC each with 50% shareholdings.








	 




	These
	shares exchange transactions between GRNQ and GRBV, A&G, and GPVC resulted in the owners of these companies obtaining a majority
	of over 89% voting interest in GRNQ. The merger of GRBV, A&G, and GPVC into GRNQ, which has nominal net assets, is considered
	to be acquisition transactions under common control. For accounting purpose, GRNQ presents consolidated financial statements as
	of the beginning of the period as though the shares exchanges had occurred at the beginning of the period. Financial statements
	of all prior periods are retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information. No goodwill was recognized for these acquisition
	transactions under common control.




	 




	The
	acquisition of F&A and Yabez is considered as business combination using the acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805

	“Business Combinations”

	, which requires all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts
	attributable to non-controlling interest, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of
	purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill.




	 




	On
	October 1, 2015, QSC Asia Sdn. Bhd., an unaffiliated third party, acquired 49% of Greenpro Capital Village Sdn. Bhd. (Formerly
	known as Greenpro Global Advisory Sdn. Bhd.) in consideration of $11,000 (RM 49,000) from Greenpro Financial Consulting Limited.
	Concurrently with such sale, Greenpro Financial Consulting Limited transferred 51% of Greenpro Capital Village Sdn. Bhd. to Greenpro
	Holding Limited, our subsidiary. This subsidiary becomes the new business arm which provides educational and support services.




	 





	NOTE
	2 – GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES






	 





	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates
	the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2015, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $567,931 and incurred a net operating loss of $383,772 for the
	year ended December 31, 2015. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through December 31, 2016 is dependent upon improving
	the profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the existing shareholders or
	external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Company’s obligations as they become due.




	 




	These
	and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements
	do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the
	amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.




	 





	NOTE
	3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described
	in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.

	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	FOR
	THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014






	(Currency
	expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))






	 





	●       
	Basis of presentation




	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
	United States of America (“US GAAP”).




	 




	●       
	Basis of consolidation




	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
	of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable, entities for which the Company
	has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated
	in consolidation. The Company records income attributable to non-controlling interest in the consolidated statements of operations
	for any non-owned portion of consolidated subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest is recorded within the equity section but separate
	from GRNQ’s equity in the consolidated balance sheets.




	 




	●       
	Use of estimates




	 




	In
	preparing these consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
	of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ
	from these estimates. The following are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates: determinations of the
	useful lives of assets, estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts, cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset
	impairment tests of long-lived assets.




	 




	●       
	Cash and cash equivalents




	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
	and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.




	 




	●       



	Accounts receivable





	 




	Accounts
	receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount less an allowance for any uncollectible accounts and do not bear interest, which
	are due on demand. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical
	collection trends and aging of receivables. Management also periodically evaluates individual customer’s financial condition,
	credit history, and the current economic conditions to make adjustments in the allowance when it is considered necessary. Account
	balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery
	is considered remote.




	 




	●       



	Inventory – finished property





	 




	Inventory
	– finished property represents a multi-unit property developed for resale on a unit by unit basis. Inventory is stated at
	cost unless the inventory is determined to be impaired in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. The
	cost of inventory – finished property includes the purchase price of property, legal fees, improvement costs to the building
	structure, and other acquisition costs. Project wide costs such as land acquisition and certain development costs are allocated
	to the specific units based upon their relative fair value before construction. All property is finished and ready for sale.

	FOR
	THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014






	(Currency
	expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))






	 





	In
	conducting its reviews for indicators of impairment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the margins on units already sold
	within the project, margins on units under contract but not closed (none as of December 31, 2015), and projected margin on future
	unit sales. The Company pays particular attention to discern if inventory is moving at a slower than expected pace or where margins
	are trending downward. As at December 31, 2015, the Company determined inventory – finished property was not impaired.

	Investment Property





	 




	Investment
	Property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated
	on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational and after
	taking into account their estimated residual values:

	FOR
	THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014






	(Currency
	expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))






	 





	●       



	Intangible assets





	 




	Intangible
	assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets represented the registration costs of trade marks registered
	in Hong Kong, the PRC, and Malaysia, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful live of ten year. Intangible assets
	acquired in business combinations are provisionally considered customer lists amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful
	live of five year.




	 




	The
	Company follows ASC Topic 350 in accounting for intangible assets, which requires impairment losses to be recorded when indicators
	of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the assets’
	carrying amounts. There were no impairment losses recorded on intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.




	 




	Amortization
	expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $35,164 and $225, respectively.




	 




	●       



	Goodwill





	 




	Goodwill
	is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed
	in a business combination. With the provision of ASC 350

	“Goodwill and Other”

	, goodwill is not amortized, rather
	it is tested for impairment annually, and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances
	change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying
	amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and would be measured as
	the excess carrying value of goodwill over the derived fair value of goodwill. The Company’s policy is to perform its annual
	impairment testing for its reporting units on December 31, of each fiscal year.




	 




	●       



	Impairment of long-lived assets





	 




	Long-lived
	assets primarily include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360-10-5,
	“

	Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

	”, the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation
	to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such
	as a significant sustained change in the business climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the reporting
	unit level. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss
	is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset. There has been no impairment charge
	for the periods presented.




	 




	●       

	Cash value of life insurance





	 




	The
	cash value of life insurance relates to the Company-owned life insurance policies on the general manager and executive corporate
	advisor of the Company, which is stated at the cash surrender value of the contract.




	 




	●       



	Investments in unconsolidated
	entities





	 




	Under
	the equity method of accounting, investments in unconsolidated entities are initially recognized in the consolidated balance sheet
	at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the Company’s proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the entity,
	distributions received, contributions and certain other adjustments, as appropriate. The Company’s share of the income or
	loss of the unconsolidated entity is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and will increase or decrease, as
	applicable, the carrying value of the Company’s investments in unconsolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheet.

	(Currency
	expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))






	 





	When
	the investment cost in an unconsolidated entity is reduced to zero, the Company records no further losses in its consolidated
	statements of operations unless the Company has an outstanding guarantee obligation or has committed additional funding to the
	entity. When such entity subsequently reports income, the Company will not record its share of such income until it exceeds the
	amount of the Company’s share of losses not previously recognized.




	 




	●       

	Comprehensive income





	 




	Comprehensive
	income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances
	from non-owner sources. The Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income consists of cumulative foreign currency translation
	adjustments.




	 




	●       



	Revenue recognition





	 




	The
	Company recognizes its revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605, “

	Revenue Recognition

	”, upon the delivery of
	its products when: (1) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (2) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (3) there
	are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related accounts receivable is probable.




	 




	(a)
	Rental income




	 




	Revenue
	from rental of leasehold land and buildings are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is
	reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased assets.




	 




	The
	Company leases its commercial office premises in Malaysia and Hong Kong under various non-cancelable operating leases with terms
	of two to three years and renewal options. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company has recorded $51,464 in rental revenue,
	based upon its annual rental over the life of the lease under operating lease, using straight-line method.




	 




	(b)
	Service income




	 




	Revenue
	from the provision of (i) business consulting and advisory services and (ii) company secretarial, accounting and financial review
	services are recognized when there is (i) an existence of contract or an arrangement (ii) services are rendered, (iii) the service
	price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonable assured.




	 




	(c)
	Sale of properties




	 




	Revenue
	from the sale of properties is recognized at the time each unit is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer.
	Specifically, the Company utilizes the full accrual method where recognition occurs when (i) the collectability of the sales price
	is reasonably assured, (ii) the seller is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale, (iii) the initial investment
	from the buyer is sufficient, and (iv) the Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring
	control of a promised property to a customer.




	 




	Revenue
	on sales of properties may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for revenue recognition have been met.

	Cost of revenues





	 




	Cost
	of revenue on rental shown on the accompanying statements of operations include costs associated with government rent and rates,
	repairs and maintenance, property insurance, depreciation and other related administrative costs. Property management fee and
	utility expenses are paid directly by tenants.




	 




	Costs
	of revenue on provision of services primarily consist of employee compensation and related payroll benefits, company formation
	cost and other professional fees directly attributable to cost in related to the services rendered.




	 




	Cost
	of revenues on sale of properties primary consist of the purchase price of property, legal fees, improvement costs to the building
	structure, and other acquisition costs. Selling and advertising costs are expensed as incurred.




	 




	●       



	Non-controlling interest





	 




	Non-controlling
	interest represents the capital contribution, income and loss attributable to the shareholders of less than wholly-owned and consolidated
	entities.




	 




	●       



	Income taxes





	 




	Income
	taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “

	Income Taxes

	” (“ASC 740”).
	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
	between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
	assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
	temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
	tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.




	 




	ASC
	740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
	uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized
	in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
	Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50%
	likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant
	facts.




	 




	The
	Company conducts major businesses in Hong Kong, Malaysia and China and is subject to tax in its own jurisdiction. As a result
	of its business activities, the Company will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities.

	Foreign currencies translation





	 




	Transactions
	denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
	prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
	currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting
	exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.

	The
	reporting currency of the Company is the United States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have
	been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company’s operating subsidiaries maintain their books and record in a local currency,
	Malaysian Ringgit (“MYR”), Renminbi (“RMB”), and Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”), which is also
	the respective functional currencies for each subsidiary as they are the primary currency of the economic environment in which
	each subsidiary operates.




	 




	In
	general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the US$ are translated
	into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, “

	Translation of Financial Statement”

	, using the exchange rate
	on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses
	resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other
	comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders’ equity.

	FOR

	(Currency
	expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))






	 





	The
	Company follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, “

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	” (“ASC
	820-10”), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier
	fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:




	 






	●





	Level
	1

	: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;






	 




	 






	●





	Level
	2

	: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and






	 




	 






	●





	Level
	3

	: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its
	own assumptions






	 




	●       
	Recent accounting pronouncements




	 




	In
	May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU
	2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”,
	and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
	the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective
	for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early
	adoption is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update to defer by one year the effective dates
	of its new revenue recognition standard until annual reporting periods beginning after January December 15, 2017 (2018 for calendar-year
	public entities) and interim periods therein. Management is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and has
	not determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.




	 




	In
	June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The pronouncement was issued
	to clarify the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved
	after the requisite service period. The pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The
	adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or
	results of operations.




	 




	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, Disclosure of Uncertainties
	about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” (“ASU 2014-15”), which establishes management’s
	responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and,
	if so, to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term “substantial doubt”
	and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be
	issued. Management will also be required to evaluate and disclose whether its plans alleviate that doubt. The guidance is effective
	for the annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter with early adoption permitted. The Company
	is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company’s financial statement presentation and disclosures.




	 




	In
	January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20) - Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items. ASU 2015-01
	eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP. As a result, an entity will no longer be required to segregate extraordinary
	items from the results of ordinary operations, to separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax,
	after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary
	item.

	NOTE
	4 - BUSINESS COMBINATIONS





	 




	On
	September 30, 2015, GRNQ completed the business purchase of 100% and 60% equity interest and assets of F&A and Yabez, respectively.
	F&A and Yabez mainly provide corporate and business advisory, company secretarial and IT related services. GRNQ agreed to
	issue 2,080,200 shares and 486,171 shares of its restricted common stock for the purchase of F&A and Yabez. Due to thin-trade
	market of the Company, the purchase price consideration transferred is based on the latest offering price in the private placement
	to third party before the acquisition close date, which is $0.8 per share of restricted common stock.




	 





	Recording
	of the Provisional Amount of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed





	 




	In
	accordance with ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations”, the Company accounts for acquisitions by applying the acquisition
	method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
	a business combination be measured at fair value as of the closing date of the acquisition. The purchase price allocation below
	has been developed based on provisional fair value of F&A and Yabez as of September 30, 2015. As of the date of this quarterly
	report, GRNQ has not completed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at the required estimates of the fair value
	of F&A and Yabez’s assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed and the related allocations of purchase price,
	but expected to be finalized before Q2 of 2016. Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to acquired intangible assets
	is based on provisional fair value estimates and subject to final management analysis, with the assistance of third party valuation
	advisors. The estimated intangible asset values and their useful lives could be affected by a variety of factors that may become
	known to GRNQ only upon access to additional information and/or changes in these factors that may occur prior to the effective
	time of the acquisition. The preliminary estimated intangible assets consist of customer relationships and customer lists. The
	estimated useful lives of customer lists are five years. Additional intangible asset classes may be identified as the valuation
	process is finalized.




	 




	The
	residual amount of the purchase price after preliminary allocation to net assets acquired and identifiable intangibles has been
	allocated to goodwill.




	 




	As
	of the acquisition date, the preliminary allocations of the purchase price are estimated as follows:

	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	FOR
	THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014

	expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))






	 





	(c)
	Credit risk




	 




	Financial
	instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes the concentration
	of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by its ongoing credit evaluation process and relatively short
	collection terms. The Company does not generally require collateral from customers. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance
	for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.




	 




	(d)
	Interest rate risk




	 




	As
	the Company has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Company’s income and operating cash flows are substantially
	independent of changes in market interest rates. The Company’s interest-rate risk arises from bank loans. The Company manages
	interest rate risk by varying the issuance and maturity dates variable rate debt, limiting the amount of variable rate debt, and
	continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates.




	 




	(e)
	Exchange rate risk




	 




	The
	reporting currency of the Company is US$, to date the majority of the revenues and costs are denominated in MYR and RMB and a
	significant portion of the assets and liabilities are denominated in MYR and RMB. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign
	exchange risk as its revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between US$, MYR
	and RMB. If MYR and RMB depreciates against US$, the value of MYR and RMB revenues and assets as expressed in US$ financial statements
	will decline. The Company does not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose it to substantial market risk.




	 




	(f)
	Economic and political risks




	 




	Substantially
	all of the Company’s services are conducted in Malaysia, the PRC and Asian region. The Company’s operations are subject
	to various political, economic, and other risks and uncertainties inherent in Malaysia. Among other risks, the Company’s
	operations are subject to the risks of restrictions on transfer of funds; export duties, quotas, and embargoes; domestic and international
	customs and tariffs; changing taxation policies; foreign exchange restrictions; and political conditions and governmental regulations
	in Malaysia.




	 




	The
	Company’s operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with
	companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and
	legal environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political
	and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary
	measures, currency conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation.

	a.




	Designed

	c.




	Evaluated
	the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions

	on such evaluation; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	d.




	Disclosed
	in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s

	affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting;






	 




	5.
	The registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
	over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors
	(or persons performing the equivalent functions):




	 






	 




	a.




	All
	significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
	information; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	b.




	Any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s

	GREENPRO
	CAPITAL CORPORATION






	 






	PRE-APPROVAL
	OF ENGAGEMENTS FOR AUDIT AND

	NON-AUDIT SERVICES BY THE PRIMARY EXTERNAL AUDITOR






	 






	APPROVED
	AS OF 23 March 2016






	 






	I.
	Background





	 




	Section
	201 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”) prohibits certain activities by the external auditor of the Company
	which is charged with performing the audit of the Company’s financial statements for the purpose of expressing an opinion
	thereon (the “primary external auditor”). The Audit Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors
	of Greenpro Capital Corp. (the “Company”) will not approve nor will the independent auditor perform for the Company
	any services that constitute prohibited activities. The prohibited non-audited services are showed in

	Exhibit 1

	.




	 




	The
	Committee of the Company is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of independent auditor. As
	part of this responsibility and in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and listing standards, the Audit Committee must
	pre-approve the audit, audit-related, other services performed by the independent auditor and ensure that the provision of such
	services does not impair the auditor’s independence. All audit services, audit related services and non-audit services to
	be provided by the external auditor should be:




	 





	 




	(i)





	Approved
	by the Audit Committee as general pre-approval with the details of the particular services and do not delegate Audit Committee
	responsibilities to the management or





	 


	 


	 




	 




	(ii)





	Specifically
	approved by the Audit Committee as specific services (Specific pre-approval). These services may be entered into pursuant
	to this Preapproval Policy.






	 




	The
	Committee shall annually review and pre-approve the audit and non-audit services supplied by the external auditor as to the nature
	and scope of the services to see if any services may effects the auditors’ independence. The term of any pre-approval is
	12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period. The Audit Committee
	with periodically revise the list of pre-approved services based on subsequent determinations.




	 

	 






	II.
	Purpose





	 




	The
	Audit Committee of the Company has adopted this Auditor Services Pre-approval Policy (the “Policy”) as part of the
	Company’s comprehensive Corporate Governance Policy in order to provide the policies and procedures followed by the Audit
	Committee in reviewing and pre-approving audit, audit-related and non-audit services to be provided by the Company’s independent
	external auditor, and to disclose those policies and procedures to the Company’s shareholders. The policies and procedures
	in this policy are set forth as guidelines and they do not constitute requirements or create legal obligations. The Audit Committee
	may supplement or modify the policies and procedures as appropriate in its discretion, or it may choose to pre-approve External
	Auditor services in other ways that it deems advisable in its business judgement.



	 








	 


	 

	1



	 









	 







	 





	III.
	Pre-approval Process





	 







	a.







	Audit
	Services







	 



	The
	Audit Committee will approve that all audit services to be performed by the primary external auditor will be performed pursuant
	to a written engagement letter which outlines the scope and nature of the services and the fees to be paid for such services,
	and review the annual audit engagement terms and related fees to see if any change in terms, conditions and fees needed resulting
	from changes in audit scope.




	 




	In
	addition to the annual audit services engagement, the Audit Committee may grant pre-approval for other audit services, which are
	those services that only the independent auditor can reasonably provide. The Audit Committee has pre-approved the audit services
	listed in


	Appendix A


	. All other audit services not listed in


	Appendix A


	must be separately pre-approved
	by the Audit Committee.




	 







	b.







	Audit-Related
	Services








	 




	Audit-related
	services, including internal control-related services, are assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance
	of the audit or review of the Company’s financial statements and/or the Company’s internal control over financial
	reporting and that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor. The Audit Committee believes that the provision of
	the audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is consistent with the SEC’s rules on auditor’s
	independence. The Audit Committee has pre-approved the audit-related services listed in


	Appendix B


	and all other
	audit-related services not listed in


	Appendix B


	must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee.




	 







	c.







	Non-audit
	services








	 




	The
	Audit Committee may grant preapproval for those permissible non-audit services classified as all other services that it believes
	would not impair the independence of the auditor and that are consistent with SEC’s rules on auditor independence, including
	those that are routine and recurring services. The Audit Committee has given policy-based preapproval for the other services listed
	in


	Appendix C.





	 



	All
	requests for non-audit services to be provided by the independent director that are not included in the pre-approval policy will
	be approved by the audit committee and include a detailed description of the services. Permissible all other services not listed
	in


	Appendix C


	must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee.



	 



	A
	list of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) prohibited non-audit services is attached to this Preapproval
	Policy as

	Exhibit 1

	. The Company will not engage its independent auditor for such services. The rules of the SEC and the
	Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) should be consulted to determine whether there are possible exceptions
	of the prohibitions.




	 







	d.







	Delegation
	of Authority









	 





	As
	provided in the


	Act, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more
	of its members. The Chairman of the Audit Committee is authorized to give specific pre-approval to any audit or non-audit services
	to be provided by the independent auditor. The Audit Committee does not delegate to management its responsibilities to pre-approve
	services performed by the independent auditor. All pre-approval decisions must be reported to the Audit Committee at its next
	scheduled meeting for informational purpose only.

We will receive all proceeds from the sale of the common stock and intend to use
the proceeds from this offering, to begin implementing the business and
marketing plan. The expenses of this offering, including the preparation of this
prospectus and the filing of this registration statement, estimated at
$10,564.40 are being paid for by us. The maximum proceeds from this offering
($500,000) will satisfy our basic, subsistence level, cash requirements for up
to 25 months including legal and accounting costs associated with this offering,
the costs associated with our continuous disclosure obligations, incidental
expenses, and the cost of implementing the investigative aspects of our business
plan, including identifying and securing consultants, operating equipment,
marketing and facility.  A total of 50% of the possible proceeds from this
offering ($250,000) will satisfy our basic, subsistence level cash requirements
for up to 12.5 months. We estimate that a total of 45.6% of the possible
proceeds from this offering (or $228,000) will satisfy our basic, subsistence
level cash requirements for up to 12 months. A total of 25% of the possible
proceeds from this offering ($125,000) will satisfy our basic, subsistence level
cash requirements for up to 6 months. A total of 10% of the possible proceeds
from this offering ($50,000) will satisfy our basic, subsistence level cash
requirements for up to 2.5 months. Our budgetary allocations may vary, however,
depending upon the percentage of proceeds that we obtain from the offering.  For
example, we may determine that it is more beneficial to allocate funds toward
securing potential financing and business opportunities in the short terms
rather than to conserve funds to satisfy continuous disclosure requirements for
a longer period.
 
Therefore, the public offering price of the shares does not necessarily bear any
relationship to established valuation criteria and may not be indicative of
prices that may prevail at any time or from time to time in the public market
for the common stock. You cannot be sure that a public market for any of our
securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a
price at or higher than the offering price in this offering.


The services we plan to provide include the cloud accounting solutions,
cross-border business solution, record management services, and accounting
outsourcing services and these services will be offered as a Package Solution.
The Package Solution we will provide bundles the cloud solution into the
traditional accounting services, thus enabling us to serve the business
entrepreneur in a wider market environment. The advantages for using the
Package Solution we intend to offer are business support for potential customers
at any time, in anywhere and with any devices. We anticipate the Package
Solution will create competitive advantages, such as reducing costs and
improving revenue for our potential customer.

In view of our Packaged Solution, we do not foresee intense competition except
those small services providers from Cornerstone Management Group in Hong Kong,
CST Tax Advisor based in Singapore and Maceda Valencia & Co based in
Philippines.


Company Description

service for small and mid-size enterprise businesses located throughout East
Asia, with a focus in Hong Kong and Malaysia. The range of services will cover

We are a development stage company in the process of developing a dedicated
platform to assist businesses to prepare financial statements, effectively
implement internal control, conduct internal audit, assess operational risks,
and structure financing and other transactions. We have never intended and do
not intend to be a blank check company. We have a specific business plan and do
not intend to engage in any merger, acquisition or business reorganization with
any entity. We do not have revenues, have minimal assets, and have incurred
losses since inception. We have had limited operations and have been issued a
“going concern” opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of
our common stock as the sole source of funds for our future operations.
