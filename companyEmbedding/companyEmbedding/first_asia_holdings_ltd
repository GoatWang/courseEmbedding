Kam Tin, Hong Kong
General
Kam Tin is identified as a strategic growth  area under the Planning and Development Study on North West New Territories.  The NDA is in close proximity to rich natural  and cultural heritage. The ecologically significant fishponds, Lam Tsuen Country Park and Mai Po Nature  Reserve are within close distance.  The  NDA is also endowed with rich cultural heritage assets, e.g. the indigenous  walled villages and 'fung shui' woodlands.  Traditionally, Kam Tin is renowned for its  status of the home of scholars.  The development of Kam Tin is highly constrained by the stringent airport height  restriction, which has limited development to medium density. 
Kam Tin Neighbourhood
The Kam Tin NDA is home to recent low  density luxurious residential developments including The Seasons Monarch developed by Li Ka-Shing's Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited, and The Scenicwoods  which is highly sought after by young families. In addition, the MTR Corporation has plans to develop on a 1 million  square feet site at Kam Sheung Road Station which is located between Pat Heung  and Kam Tin.

Future University Town Site
In November, 2003 the Hong Kong Planning  Department commissioned a paper on ideal locations for setting up a University  Town one of which being Kam Tin due to its low density development and close proximity  to rich rural and cultural heritage. The following extracts are from that  paper:
"Medium density development in a discrete  valley provides an ideal setting for a university town. Given the constraints of Kam Tin, it may be more suitable to develop the area as a university town."

Fanling, Hong Kong
Background
Fanling  is one of the “new towns” in Hong Kong’s New Territories which has enjoyed  steady population growth and developments over the past two decades.  The environment in this new town is well  harmonized with a mix of residential, commercial, industrial, social, community  and recreational facilities.  Trading  activities have flourished in the past decade taking full advantage of the  strategic location as the gateway to Mainland China and good accessibility.  Commercial-office buildings have also been  developed to provide commercial floor spaces to meet the needs of the  industry.  Amidst the busy economic  activities, the hills and mountain ranges form a unique backdrop of this new  town, which has about 6 million square feet of land reserved for local and  district open space uses for both active and passive activities.  Major active recreational facilities in this  new town include the Hong Kong Golf Club, the North District Sports Ground, the  North District Park, and the Wo Hing Indoor Recreation Centre.
The  new town consists of an extensive road network with connecting highway and  major roads in addition to the modernized MTR East Rail Line (Fanling Station  and Sheung Shui Station) and Lok Ma Chau Spur Line.  The strategic highway network connects major  town centres in the New Territories, including Fanling, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Sheung  Shui and Yuen Long, and provides linkage to cross-boundary facilities and  distributor roads.
Future Developments
Fanling has been identified as one of the New  Development Areas which are under planning in the North East New Territories  New Development Areas Study commissioned in mid-2008 for completion in  2011.  The Hong Kong Government has  extensive plans to further develop this new town into a sustainable,  environmental friendly, energy efficient, people oriented and obstacle free  community.  Comprehensive village layout  plans have been prepared for the village areas of Fanling and existing roads  are being upgraded and new roads are being constructed to meet traffic growth.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
