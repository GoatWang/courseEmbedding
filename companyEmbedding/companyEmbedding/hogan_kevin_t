    Spring 

Internet
    Marketing Course was the best class
    ever!!! I cannot believe how much I learned from you. My new business has
    grown exponentially during this class. I also learned so much from the other
    participants. It was one of the best experiences I have ever had in an
    online class!"
Sonya "Sunny" Lenzo, St. Paul, Minnesota
"Kevin, Just to let you know I 
	had an amazing experience the other day. I was talking to a shop assistant, 
	I needed a book reserved which this shop doesn't do generally and was not 
	having much luck until I started activating her maps. Within minutes the 
	book was not only on hold but it was as if she was mesmerized hanging on my 
	every word. Now I really see how powerful this stuff is. Your work has so 
	inspired me improving my business and persuasion skills no end. I have four 
	of your books and can't wait to get more."
William Goldsworthy

The ALL NEW 8-week Comprehensive & Systematic Course for Wealth Creation and Accumulation
The Wealth Creation and Accumulation System E-Course


Whether you earn $40,000 or $400,000 per year, this private E-Course will be one you will always talk about with friends when telling them what helped you transform from where you are today to where you will be then.
"Wealth is definitely about money, but it is also much more than just money. It's about living your life on your own terms while your wealth grows!" 


Being wealthy comes down to a decision and a choice. 

Having what you deserve in life is your selection when you arrive at the vending machine. 

During this unique 8 week E-course, you'll take at least one step up the pyramid of life. By the time you have completed the course, if you choose, you'll find yourself already having completed the single most difficult piece of wealth accumulation. When you complete the course, you will have a proven plan and a unique guide to make sure you do exactly what you are supposed to do!


It's fun, it's exciting, it's intense, and whether you are a millionaire today or you will be starting from scratch, this experience will show you the way, simplify your life, give you more joy and give you the pleasure of watching your new pile of gold grow each day. 

There's all kinds of neat little blueprints to building wealth out there. 
I've seen most of them. I suppose in a perfect world some could work. 

But when I sat down and looked at the bestselling plans to see what was missing and why so many people were disappointed, it was obvious that what was needed was a REAL system.

System implies algorithm. Algorithm implies step by step predictability and completion.

Some programs I checked out were grounded in silliness. "If you get a 12% return on your money per year then you...."

Here's the thing...THAT is NOT going to happen. I've met perhaps a handful of people who know the truth about investing.

Ready?

The stock market, after taxes, dividends, inflation and transaction costs has returned 4% per year since 1984. Since 1962? 2%.

The stock market is very cyclical and predictably so.

It's highly unlikely the markets will return the same 4% over the next decade. 

What's the truth about that 12% number?

No one can promise it or guarantee it. No one.

Wealth accumulation is not about investing in stocks or bonds.

You'll learn the truth about if and when in this course...but now is not the time for either.


Honest to goodness, most of what is out there might be well intended but the teaching is so airy fairy that no one could actually do anything with what they learn. There were a few exceptions. There were some "methods" that simply wouldn't and couldn't work. They were disturbing approaches to securing a sound future. I wasn't sure which I liked less.

When you were born, there was no Life Instruction Manual. There was also no Wealth Manual and to date there never has been...until now. 

Aside from being immensely valuable, you're about to experience the most valuable system you'll ever use. It's fun which means you'll use it every single day!
 



You've heard of going from 0 to 60 in 8 seconds in reference to a car, right?


Have you ever heard of going from starting with $1,000,000 in debt only to become a millionaire?

Someone wrote that about me and while it's technically correct...there's more to the story than numbers.


You probably know a bit of my story. Here is the thumbnail in three paragraphs:

I was raised in Chicago by a darn good Mom. Our family moved between poor, can't get any poorer and lower class depending on whether Mom was married or not at the time...whether someone had just died or was dying in a hospital or yes when there were not one but TWO hospital beds in our tiny home. 

Life was often nothing short of emotionally brutal. Our neighborhood was not violent although one guy did burn down the entire high school that was attended by 1600 people. (OK, that was a little distressing.)

Everyone that grew up in that child packed neighborhood had choices in life. They could choose to live a lower income bracket life when they got older. They could choose to live a middle class life when they got older. They could choose to live with an upper class income bracket when they got older.

It was and still is a choice.

I have no idea what your life experience was as a kid. I hope it was fantastic! Our experience was unusual. We were not only poor but we had the largest unforeseen debt load of anyone you've ever known. It was absolutely not anyone's fault or "choice." We didn't have any money to spend. There were no credit cards. My first step dad spent the better part of 5 years in and out of the hospital accumulating debt that exceeded one million dollars. How does hospital debt get so big? Once you exceed a lifetime limit, the insurance doesn't pay out benefits. It's a long story with a lot of instructive experiences that I'll save for the course. 

As you grow up, it becomes pretty obvious you can choose to live in poverty your entire life, make minor changes or make major changes.

I don't know about you, but I hated being poor. I wasn't afraid of it because I lived it for a decade. When I was 11, the Boy Scouts brought a Thanksgiving turkey and old clothes. Some fit, some didn't, all got worn, "better than not having any at all," was indeed the correct answer.

"It makes no difference where you begin. Got a job? Don't? Have debt? Don't? It just doesn't matter. Where you are going is 100% your decision."


Today in America, 18% of people in the upper income bracket today were in the bottom 1/3 income brackets one decade ago. 

You can know those kind of numbers will continue. It's inspiring.

What caused 18% of people to leave living in lower income brackets to living a more fulfilling and rewarding life?

It won't be because they got lucky.
It won't be because someone gave them a job.
It won't be because the government cut them a check.

It will be because they chose to change their life situation.

Period.

Some people want you to believe that if you were or even if you are poor today, for some wild reason you are destined to remain there forever as if someone is stopping people from living their dreams. That is not only untrue, it's a dangerous belief. 
  
In the Wealth Creation and Accumulation System E Course you'll be exposed to a new world.



There are no courses on wealth accumulation or wealth psychology offered in high school. There is no "playbook." 

Then when you get to college...there are no courses offered on the psychology of wealth accumulation. In the last 4 years, we've learned more about wealth accumulation at the research level and the face to face in the real world level than we knew the previous hundred years combined.

And things have changed so dramatically in the last decade that the playing field doesn't even look the same.

If you went to college you probably went so that when you got out, you'd be able to "get a job." And one thing is for sure, if you graduated from college you had a huge advantage over those who didn't graduate from college. A college graduate earns about 1.5 times what a non graduate earns.

Ultimately that dollar figure will almost always be enough to "get by," and will do nothing toward growing wealth.

To be clear, about 90% of households in the U.S. regardless of their income have no chance at accumulating wealth without making the changes itemized in this system. Paradoxically almost every one of those households has the actual ability to live a wealth life.

It seems ridiculous to think that someone earning $65,000 per year doesn't have a better "chance at wealth" as someone earning $40,000 per year. It's counter-intuitive but they simply don't. The person at $65,000 annual income is living paycheck to paycheck in about 80% of families. The same is true, surprisingly enough for households earning $100,000 per year! 

It's no wonder people get off to a terribly slow start in life. It's no wonder people get on a Hamster Wheel and stay there for decades. It's tragic and heartbreaking.

Very little about having wealth is intuitive.

Today something like 40,000,000 people in the USA are on food stamps. 

I remember the one and only time we used food stamps when I was a kid. I was about 7 years old and we went shopping. My Mom had three kids, no husband, no full time job, no resources and she broke down and took money from the government...for two weeks.

She was so disgusted that we never used them again. She'd earn her own money and not take that which was earned by someone else. She got a full time job instead. Thank God she made that decision or I might have been a very different person today. 

"Your psychological programming needs to be changed to move beyond where you are today."


Your money memory is a very important part of your programming, just as it is mine. Those early experiences with money shaped your beliefs, attitudes and behaviors around money.


Most of those beliefs, attitudes and behaviors are dysfunctional and need REPAIR. 

I know because it took a long time to unplug the vast majority of those programs which were a life disaster. Unfortunately one category of sabotaging money memory is enough to erase any opportunity at growing wealth.

I'd like to suggest to you that three things comprise wealth. Time, Money and Love. 

Had I not had a Mom who loved me, again, my life would have been very different. Once you have food, water and shelter, love and time become very important.

The idea of being wealthy never was important to me until 1994. I certainly never wanted or even considered the notion of being "rich." I didn't see the point.

At that point you could see that the United States was going the way of Japan. We (as a nation) had been great and we were going to start a slide that 30 years from that point was going to be ugly. Political parties started buying votes with promises of "free money."

One of my few strengths as a person was math, particularly statistics and probability. I ran the math in 1994 and I got very concerned that living a "normal life" wouldn't be a normal life for the duration of my life. It was obvious that carrying on as I was would actually go backward over time. And that is precisely what happened.

I started researching various options and developed an approach to building wealth that relied on thinking. It took several years before a track record was established.

Got a track record?



Here's one page of that record:



At the turn of the 21st century, "the economy" had gotten much worse. Pretty much all the nations in the world were printing a lot of counterfeit money which meant that money wasn't going to be worth what it was for the previous three centuries. By the mid 2000's I had put myself in a financial position that was sensible and I began to encourage people who read my work to buy gold. At the time, gold was $450 per ounce. I had begun buying gold not long before that. 



Financial advisers wrote emails to me every day telling me I was wrong. But they lived in a very small world. They based their thinking on a set of principles and beliefs instilled by their industry that no longer matched what was happening in the world. I told thousands of them they needed to get their clients in gold. Four years ago on twitter I told people to get out of the stock market completely that it was going to go off a cliff. It was simply obvious based on the data I use. 

It did just that. 

You're going to see a similar experience in the next year. 

I'll show you how to navigate your way through this mess.






"What I gained from this course is simply beyond what I can express through words...the required 'push', a lot of confidence, wiping out a lot of fears from me that I could not bring forth and explain, identifying a few damaging personal weaknesses I developed over the years running on the wheel, re-assurances on a lot of flashes of thought which I firmly believed were true - but got buried as I could not gather evidence to support those, and a lot of insights that no one else would have ever shared with me. And a unique feedback I can give - I am based in India, a few time zones and culturally different - but what you have shared is absolutely true for us. I consider this a turning point in my life. Thank you once again!" Anish Augustine, Bangalore, India


 






Meanwhile in that 2007 - 2009 period, what happened was most Americans went into a tailspin. They lost their ability to move out of their homes because they had mortgages that were bigger than what their house was worth or what they had paid for it...and they had no wealth. Middle class America rolled the dice that a box of wood would go up in value. It made no sense. People really believed that a house was an investment. It's not. It is a store
of value. It will always be worth something, but you can't count on it to go up in value. That's just silly. 

Gold shot up from $450 to $1200+. Some of my readers would email me saying "Thank you" over and over and over. They watched $100,000 turn into $300,000 in less than 7 years.

Now $300,000 is not "rich." And I'm not saying I single handedly helped people get rich over night. That just isn't right. I simply showed people how to save their financial lives and secure themselves and those they love while the people who didn't take the time to learn about wealth and money started slipping off the cliff. You can only save the people who listen. Most people were stuck in a 20th century model trying to make decisions in the 21st century. The world had chanced.  They wanted to be right. "They believed" in nonsense they were taught and they went down the tubes.

Today the financial advisers are paying close attention.

People who followed the plan built stepping stones to wealth. Everyone else lost...a lot.

There is very good news, however.

"Don't let anyone kid you: Building wealth in this decade is VERY DIFFERENT but NO MORE difficult than it was in 2008 or 2004 or 1994." 

You simply want to let it happen much faster than you would have 10 years ago. 


And fear not. There are no stocks to buy. There is nothing "risky" that needs to be done. Quite the opposite.  This is the new paradigm of building wealth, NOT investing. If you have some cool investing plan that has been in your family for 10 or 20 years, have at it. It won't interfere. Your financial planner's job is secure though you might want to teach her what you learn so she doesn't go broke along with everyone else. If she follows her own advice....

Your life is impacted by world events. The economy is impacted by world events. But growing wealth is a pretty basic life function that anyone can do in spite  of world events.

At NO TIME IN HISTORY has crisis or disaster stopped individuals who understood what was going on, from growing wealth and securing their future. 1000 years ago, no one invested in stock markets and wealth was built through good times and bad.

The last 10 years have brought more variables to the table that have to be accounted for and incorporated into the Wealth Equation.

Fortunately there is an equation.

"Think about it. Do you have any idea what the right answer is to these questions?" 


Do you know if you should be buying a house in 2017? 

Do you know if you should be leaving your job for another? 

Do you know if you should buy gold or stocks or commodities or futures or anything else? 

Do you know what allows you to grow wealth like those in the upper income bracket?

Most people don't have the answer to those questions. They'll never learn the answer to those questions. And there is a sad reason this is the case. We'll talk about this in depth during the 8 Week E-Course.



And there are cut and dried and answers to all of those questions.

The big picture is now scripted.

You can build wealth or you can fall off the cliff. It's all a choice.

But keep in perspective that money, or what money buys is more about quality of life for the rest of your life than it is about skyscrapers and personal jets.

Time.
Love.
Money.

You really need all three to have a life you deserve.

And when you do you have all three, you have REAL WEALTH.


The answer to "how do I build wealth" is pretty simple, but the execution requires finesse. There is absolutely a small number of approaches that are right and a monstrous set that are wrong.

And without wealth, access to time, love and money, you could survive but you will barely be alive.


Wealth in one way, is like an Oasis...


It is yours and it is there to serve you when you need it. And like reaching the Oasis, you start out in the middle of nowhere and only those who get to The Oasis will drink the cool water.

I don't want to sound all serious about wealth. It has it's fun side too.

Wealth also has some perks to it.

Wealth isn't about the limo, although I do like the limo.

It's not about the Penthouse Suite...but it is sweet. (I rarely use the jacuzzi, but I like the VIP service and special treatment.)

It's not about getting paid to travel to all kinds of exotic places in the world, although that's pretty cool.
For me personally, wealth is about safety, security, peace of mind, never having to worry about what life will be like next year, 5 years from now, 15 years from now, 25 years from now, 35 years from now.  It's taken care of.  Not exactly exciting stuff to think about. But for me it solves a myriad of problems.


Wealth allows some people the ability to party nonstop. 

Wealth allows some people to have hot cars and hit all the hot bars.


Wealth allows some people to be socialites and the center of the attention.

Here's the thing. If you earn it, do what you want and live how you choose.


Today it's hard to think of an argument to not make it a big Life Priority.

 There are plenty of "roads to wealth," now you can actually take your pick...


About 1 in 10 of the wealthy simply inherit it. That's good for them. It did nothing for you and me. 



9 in 10 who choose to be wealthy secured themselves in predictable ways. And there really are a few predictable ways people become wealthy. The last 20 years have given us more opportunities than ever. 


It's such a paradox. There have never been more ways to achieve wealth.


It's really important to know which of those ways are a) best for you and b) going to be easiest and ecological, going forward.


 The Comprehensive Wealth Accumulation Method
The Wealth Accumulation Method helps you to work with a tool called  The Wealth Matrix where you see how Money, Time and Love interweave into this thing called life. In the end you see what actions to take, when to take them, how to measure your results and ultimately have what you want.



This course will guide you so you can begin the step by step process of breaking away from the chains that bind people to the past and the status quo and begin living an exciting, hopeful, abundant future.  

Perhaps you sell products and services, or maybe you work at a good old fashioned "job." That is all history. You may or may not choose to make adjustments. There's lots of right answers and many times more wrong ones. You'll see them all play out in the game at lightning speed.
In just 8 weeks, with the assistance of the course, I'll guide you through a method of safely and securely creating shifts in your life. 
 Abundance and financial freedom are predictable commodities.


By taking advantage of the little known but very important, Price's Law, I'll show you how you can virtually assure yourself any result you desire in any field or niche. Price's Law makes wealth accumulation as predictable as the eventual arrival of a plane en route to a destination.



You'll literally be able to look at yourself and say, "Ah, in order to get what I want, I simply to do this." And you don't have to guess. It's all laid out for you.


I'm just like you. I had to learn the hard way. The very hard way. I looked at every "opportunity" (scam) and bought into more than a few. It got old quickly.
I changed my approach.

I started studying the DIFFERENCES between people who grow wealth and those who don't. I found what most of the serious students of the affluent have found. Most of the things reported in pop psychology books and magazines don't make much difference in achievement...in greatness...in wealth. 

You learn what you NEVER learn in college!

The fact is that there's a LOT of stuff both the affluent and the poor (and everyone in between) do. This was a huge distinction and one that caused me to really scramble about a decade ago. The difference in what I thought was real vs. what IS real was the difference of millions of dollars.


If you really want to achieve Personal Financial Freedom, the freedom from bills and living paycheck to paycheck...you can be quite sure it will happen. 


Everything you learn in this course will be...


a) tangible.
b) something YOU can actually DO.
c) take work but not slavery.
d) vehicles that I've taken and can vouch for their safety.
Wealth is Best Generated with VERY Small Risks


I'm pretty risk averse....OK, VERY risk averse. 

The first decision you make is to not make stupid decisions.
The second decision you make it to MOVE NOW.

I've done what I have set out to do by of having a really good playbook, being smart enough to do things I find interesting or things I actually LIKE to do, and yes, recognizing and getting past limitations. (Ex. I don't look like Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise)


If you're looking to emulate the extremes of Donald Trump, this is the wrong place for you. 


If you would like to live an abundant life where you achieve Financial Freedom....Personal Freedom, then here is the place. You will be given the keys. All you have to do is turn the keys in the ignition and "go." 


It's an eight week process. It's fascinating, introspective, you REALLY learn about YOU. You'll find out how you ended up where you are. You'll find out exactly how to get where you want to go.

The approach I've developed for you is unique and it is special in that it accounts for personal significance and meaning in the equation of growing a life of abundance.  

Eight weeks where you'll apply what you learn and create pathways to financial freedom in your life!



Question:

If I could show you how to create the life you desired, adopt the mindset of the wealthy, and literally give you a step-by-step handbook to manifest your life filled with abundance -- would you be interested?
And what happens when you put this system into practice after the course is completed??

					What Else Are People Saying About Kevin Hogan, Body

					Coaching, Mentoring?

"Your service is exceptional. The quality of your service 
	made me enjoy spending money with you."Fred Frego, MountainView, AR 

"Just finished the
	
	Wealth Accumulation course. It's a bit earth shattering - in an amazing 
	way. I have a complete turnaround on some old beliefs that will make the 
	coming year fabulous! Thank you!" Lisa Hyatt
"My sincere thanks for the experience of your
	
Internet 
	Marketing Course. I am truly in awe of your unwavering commitment 
	and effort to deliver the absolute best information possible. Your readers 
	and subscribers are the better for every word you write and every thought 
	you express. There is nothing like this course anywhere - it brings new 
	meaning to the words 'comprehensive' and 'truth'. You once wrote, 'Trust me 
	until I give you a reason not to'. That reason has never and will never 
	appear. Thanks again!"  JC MacKenzie, RRT, RCP
"I'm finding the
	
	Decision Point E-course absolutely fascinating. Firstly, because I had 
	totally underestimated the value and effect of decisions on our lives. 
	Secondly, I've always been aware of some of my biases - I'm a fairly ardent 
	feminist for example, and I have often stopped and questioned myself if I'm 
	"seeing through a feminist filter" and I do laugh at myself sometimes when I 
	realize. But I had no idea just how prevalent other biases are, and this 
	course is a fascinating voyage of self-discovery. I'm enjoying the course 
	from a learning perspective in general - your other courses that I've done 
	have been for the purpose of improving my business, whereas this one, while 
	it will definitely help in that regard too, feels as though it's more for me 
	personally. I'm also enjoying the learning for learning's sake as much as 
	for self-development. This course is such a huge eye-opener!" Clare 
	Delaney, Mauritius
"Do you want to save yourself several years of blindfolded 
	trial and error and all the mental anguish of missed opportunities so you 
	can propel your professional speaking career? So did I. That's why I took 
	Kevin Hogan's Professional 
	Speakers Course Kevin generously gives to all the participants from his extensive experience 
	as a top-notch internationally known speaker. As a result of my 
	participation, I am a much more polished and interesting professional 
	speaker, leap frogging over what would have taken 2 additional years just 
	out on the road speaking. Additionally, I have a number of ways to earn a 
	very viable income as a speaker now and in the future as a direct result. Of 
	course, this is a Kevin Hogan course, so you know it will be jam packed each 
	week with excellent content and practical application to do. Whatever you 
	do, avoid getting behind and keep implementing. This is a fantastic class, 
	and I highly recommend it to anyone!" April Braswell, Dating and 
	Relationship Expert, Southwest, USA www.AprilBraswell.net
"For me, the trouble with psychology stuff is that I find it 
	too interesting -- I just want more... but I need to focus my time on my 
	business. Kevins stuff is among the worst, because its among the best... I 
	want to listen/read/learn more. I believe Kevin's material is up there with 
	the work of Stephen R. Covey, Robert B. Cialdini, and other masters. 
	Fortunately, Kevins material is also about getting your finger out and 
	doing. And it works." Richard Clunan,

"I found Kevin's web site
    about a year ago and always look forward to Coffee with Kevin Hogan.
    I attended Kevin Hogan's Influence Boot Camp 2008. I thought it would
    be a great opportunity to see Kevin up close and in person and see if he was
    the real deal. Well, let me tell you the entire experience far exceeded my
    expectations. It was packed with quality real life information that I could
    take home and use. The speakers were excellent and top experts in their
    fields. And there was no sales pitch from any of the speakers, they just
    shared their cutting-edge information. I walked away very impressed with
    Boot Camp and Kevin Hogan. I could see that Kevin was very genuine in his
    desire to make a difference in people's lives. And he has the background,
    knowledge and ability to truly do that. I would recommend Boot Camp to
    anyone. I don't care what business you're in - you will have more
    information than you'll be able to process. I have the Influence
    Boot Camp 2008 DVD's and I'm glad I do - as I watch them I realize how
    much information and practical real life skills that were presented that I
    did not fully absorb while there. It was the best learning experience of my
    life." Scott A. Bell  

"Just wanted to thank you. I took your Decision
Point E-Course earlier this year, and have put the ideas
    into practice. I knew I wanted to leave my job, but didn't seem able to
    decide when, how, etc. Well, using what I learned from you, I was able to
    make a very definitive decision about NOW being the time. I feel great about
    the timing in my life now and at peace with the decisions I made. This means
    so much to me! Mahalo nui loa (thank you so very much)."  Stephanie
    Smedes, Seattle, WA




"I have been receiving
  your newsletter for a couple of years now as well as several others. Over that
  time, I have 'weeded out' most. I have purchased some of your products and
  believe you are the 'real deal'. Your insights and the wisdom you impart have
  been, are, and will be invaluable. Many thanks." 
       	 Mark Estlick, Seattle, WA  
"You have created a 'cookie 
	cutter' plan to wealth via the internet with your
	Internet 
	Marketing Course; all the participants must do is follow the directions, 
	amazingly easy, thank you." Michael Neumann, Tikrit, Iraq




Covert Hypnosis. 
	My learning experience is best described as drinking from a fire hose! You 
	have provided so much valuable information in these works I have trouble 
	deciding what to work on first. In Covert Persuasion you explain the Focused 
	Outcome Mindset (and you mentioned it in a recent coffee).  I used to 
	reject the idea of influencing others as manipulation and inappropriate. I 
	see now that we influence others all the time; I just never took the effort 
	to be intentional about it. Thanks again for your great work. You have 
	really helped me be more effective in my sales and my life. I will continue 
	to study your works." Dave Gurnee



	"I thought that your
	
Decision
Point E-Course was an excellent and incredibly valuable course. 
	The amount of information is unbelievable. I'm going to be reviewing it for 
	a while. I have read reviews that say you overdeliver and boy do you ever. I 
	have already recommended your course to two friends. Thanks Kevin, for a 
	great course!" Mike Hendry, Calgary, Alberta, Canada 



 "The 
		Psychology of Wealth (included in
	The 
		Millionaire Mind Program) is an amazing program that has helped me 
		peel back the layers that have repeatedly caused me to fumble. My whole 
		life, I had been repeating the same patterns and could not figure out 
		why, nor did I even notice the similarities. This program has not only 
		helped me identify the foundation of these events but has also allowed 
		me to reprogram myself  so I don't repeat the same events. By doing the 
		self-work in this course, Kevin has laid the foundation for anyone who 
		wants to master themselves.
	I've invested in many 
		of the "other" get rich programs (many of them were great) but none of 
		them discussed the sabotaging beliefs like this program and without 
		identifying your personal road blocks, you're almost guaranteed not to 
		make it to your dream destination in life because your subconscious mind 
		will cause you to repeat the same events over and over to avoid previous 
		programming. This program will help you identify your personal road 
		blocks, teach you to overcome them and reach your dream life. I strongly 
		recommend The Psychology of 
		Wealth 
		to anyone who is serious about achieving financial independence and 
		changing their life."
Brian C. Saviano, Oak Brook, IL 



"I enrolled in your
	Internet 
	Marketing Course  
	and I was 'blown away' by the content and quality of the course. It exceeded 
	my wildest expectations. I was more than pleased. I have recommended your 
	course to many business associates and would encourage anyone who wants to 
	'master' the Internet to take your course. I am still amazed at the content 
	and deliverables you provided! Job well done!"  
Steven Chambers, www.stevechambers.com 



"I am in 
	the midst of Kevin Hogan's Public Speaking Course and it is changing my 
	life. I started the course not entirely convinced it would provide much more 
	than what my graduate degrees in communication and experience in public 
	speaking and teaching had already given me. I was wicked wrong. Kevin and 
	the other course members are great sources of information and feedback, the 
	content provided is worth much more than the cost, and you can't beat 
	constant practice and "doing" vs. theory and reading. As a result of the 
	course I am moving away from a theoretical and academic understanding of 
	communication and persuasion to a practical, effective doing of 
	communication. Thanks!" Lisa Perry, JD PhD
 

"Kudos for your
	



Public Speaking 
	Program. And I never even have to leave the house. I actually love doing 
	in-person presentations, but they aren't the only way to do things. I also 
	do teleseminars, and I have just launched a new joint venture project with 
	some of the big names in Internet Marketing. I am interviewing 7 of Mark 
	Joyner's Space Monkeys from his 7 Day Business Turnaround Kit, and Mark 
	himself. The participants include Jason Henderson, Michael Morgan, Tom 
	Justin, Reed Floren, and more. Thank you for the inspiration, the skills, 
	and giving me the courage to make this dream into reality!"
 Tania 
	Baildon, Wealth Virus Expert  
	 

	"I have been reading your work for a very long time now, years in fact. I 
	recommend your work to everyone I know and tell them to sign up for your 
	newsletter. I hope to take your speaking program because I do like the idea 
	of controlling my future. You really are about the only guy I pay attention 
	to on the Internet, and admire at the same time. Keep up the good work."

	Bryan Price, Bakersfield, CA




	 
"Kevin, you have truly moved me to the next level in professional 
		speaking. I have much respect and gratitude for your professionally 
		planned  
 
Professional
    Speakers Course. I will highly recommend it to anyone
    interested. Your content is packed with more than you promised, your
    teaching style is powerful and your guidance is very encouraging. Everything
    I learned is already in action. Thank you for your knowledge, support and
    secrets of this profession. I met you in L.A 2007, I subscribe to Coffee
    with Kevin Hogan, and have now taken two courses...you rock!!!"

"I was
    interested in changes in my life, but not knowing which direction. I took a
    chance with your book, The Science of Influence, It looked very attractive,
    and I found out by reading it, it has great substance! I changed my life and
    started building my own business as a financial planner and I must say your
    book and website have given me great help. Thank you for sharing your ideas,
    especially the Psychology
      of Wealth Accumulation
Coffee with Kevin Hogan, and more! I also
    have to say I have built more friends in the past 6 months than I made over
    the last 6 years by helping them honestly. Now I'm daring to make decisions.
    Thank you very much!"  Wolfgang Schernhammer, Austria  “Want 
to influence others? Want to persuade others? Want to sell others? Then 
	Science of Influence is not just an option – it’s a landmark breakthrough of information you can 
use the minute you read it.” 


--Jeffrey Gitomer, author of The Little Red Book of Selling  


		
      
      "Persuasion Protocol
	contains extensive and up to date 
	research about persuasion and marketing. Kevin Hogan over-delivers in terms 
	of massive content and utterly applicable stories, metaphors and ideas about 
	persuasion. I view Kevin as my back-up research expert who affirms or 
	negates the viewpoints that evolve in my clinical work as a psychotherapist. 
	The only problem in buying anything by Kevin Hogan is that it is humbling to 
	see how much he gets done and all that he knows. However, you will know far 
	more and be far more productive when you listen to this program and put it 
	into practice. It is worth all the time and money you put into it."

"We are only half way through this 

Professional 
	Speakers Course  and 
	I can't believe what I have already learned...and we still have four weeks 
	to go! I have only one regret; that I didn't sign up for this course two 
	years ago. Interestingly enough, I own many of the top books on building 
	your speaking business, and I am excited to say that Kevin has revealed 
	strategies for supercharging our speaking career that weren't even hinted at 
	in these popular books on the same topic. If you are looking for someone to 
	take your money and tell you everything you're doing is fantastic (when it's 
	not), then this course is probably not for you. However, if you are looking 
	for someone who will tell it like it is, someone who truly wants you to 
	succeed, and someone who is willing to share all of his secrets of speaking 
	success with you, then don't make the same mistake I did - enroll in this 
	course as soon as possible. Kevin Hogan is the real deal!"

"Thanks
      for making a change in my life. I never miss our Coffee meeting
      Monday mornings and it made me resign from my job and start my own venture
      4 months ago, making 3 times the amount of money I used to. I also read
      your book, Covert
      Persuasion, awesome stuff. Thanks for everything." Johan

"Ordered
    my 5th Volume of The

    it. Thanks!"  David Graska, Elk Grove, CA 
"Dear Kevin, Have you
      been following me? I just finished Chapter 8 of your new book,  The 168

	 "I wanted to 
		let you know how appreciative I am of your 

 Professional
    Speakers Course. It is a definite must for anyone who is thinking

		effectively communicate with an audience of 6 or 600, you will benefit 
		from the skills the Professional Speakers Course delivers. These 
		communication skills are applicable to many more applications than just 
		public speaking. Also, thank you for the additional tools and gifts your 
		provided. It was a pleasure to take an e-learning course where you were 
		there personally to coach me along the way, provide feedback and

"Kevin, I wanted to thank you for
      your amazing contribution to the MDRT conference last year in Las Vegas.
      Of all the speakers there, yours was the most influential to my
      practice.  Not only was it entertaining, it has helped me look at the
      world and people with a deeper perspective. I appreciate the
      "free" bonus material you provided.  I also enjoy your
      coffee talk weekly eNewsletter."

"Kevin, I have 
	received incredible value and benefit from your 

Professional 
	Speakers Course. 
	You have left no stone unturned per pro speaking. I highly recommend this 
	program to anyone considering speaking professionally! Thanks!" 
	Michael Roth, DC
"As 
	a complete self-confessed Internet amateur I started the 

Internet 
	Marketing Course both excited and 
	challenged. Well, all my expectations were surpassed and then some. The 
	information and knowledge has allowed me to feel and be ahead of the game 
	when it comes to working via the web for business and wealth creation. Kevin 
	was more than just a mentor, he was my motivator and friend. Throughout the 
	course, Kevin was always ready and available to help and assist. His 
	material invites you the student to create and explore wherever you are in 
	business so that you achieve and go beyond yourself. Kevin has been the 
	invisible force and drive which moved me to take action TODAY!" 
David Power, Clinical Hypnotherapist, London





		
		
					
	"Wow, you really do over-deliver! I have at least 2 months 
	more work to do even after the course is over. I am not complaining...this 
	is GREAT. I have arranged 3 speaking engagements already and I have a 
	blueprint for my future speaking to be successful. Not only have your 
	prepared the soil you have helped water and fertilize it! I previously 
	thought speaking was just speaking, but boy, was I wrong! Thanks for helping 
	me open my eyes - and - giving us tools to manifest what we are learning 
	with your 

Professional 
	Speakers Course.  
	All of the add-on information helps us have multiple streams of income as 
	well as better and more effective marketing. What you have delivered is more 
	than what I thought I would receive, and frankly, it is worth more than you 
	charged. I can't wait to get to the $100K mark...you have already deserved a 
	bonus and the course is not over yet!." Karl W. Ellerbeck, NCMT 


"Thank you so much for
  your weekly shots of 'Coffee'! I really appreciate being able to
  benefit from your wisdom, knowledge, humor and kindness on a regular
  basis."
		 
      Sean Cook,
  The Cotswolds, UK 


"You
    taught me how to gather information by observation, and how to communicate
    information effectively and convincingly. Your contributions to my career
    are too many to list. A great deal of information was gleaned from your
    newsletter. I have never bought a lottery ticket. I don't think the odds are
    in my favor, but every time I buy one of your training programs, I feel like
    I just won the Powerball. Thank you for all of your help!" 
		 Fred
    Frego, Mountain View, AR

"IT'S UNFAIR! Where was Kevin 
					with his  
					Professional Speakers Course 
					when I was starting my business??? If I had known all this 
					before, it would have saved me a fortune and earned me 
					a fortune already! The course felt like a 1-on-1 coaching or 
					mentoring - packed with unique audio info and reading 
					material focused strictly on business practice. Always 
					delivered on time and always much more than you could digest 
					at one sitting! Kevin pushed me up against my limits and 
					transformed these limitations to a vast potential. Thanks a 
					million!"   Ewa Zaremba, www.learning-masters.pl
 



"Kevin, with two thirds of 
	the 
	Professional Speakers Course behind me you continue to challenge and 
	push me beyond limits I did not even realize existed. With over 400 pages of 
	unadvertised course manuals, 20+ hours of recorded training material, 
	continual opportunities for active participation and one third of the 
	training still to come, I cannot fathom what you have left to share! I 
	havent even read about a course that contains half of the materials that 
	you have covered to this point, and still say there is more! The opportunity 
	to interact with the other participants really pulled it all together. 
	Thanksso far."
Murray R. Mortlock, CD, Alberta, Canada 


	"Hi Kevin, I just finished listening to your CD
    course on persuasion and wanted to give you feedback: fantastic! Great
    stuff and very well presented, a pleasure to follow. It's been a long time
    since I've heard such good stuff; last time in my own sociological studies.
    You really point out very interesting and surprising aspects." Andreas Scheuermann, Lake Lucerne, Switzerland



"Kevin, this week I secured a further 12 speaking engagements where I am 
	speaking for free. This is the start of my career and I want to speak 
	wherever I can. However, get this...I am also speaking at two large 
	engagements with 500 and 600 attendees respectively. Both paid. I am just 
	doing everything you told me to do. I am getting myself out there in every 
	shape and form and it all is beginning to happen. I am on the edge of some 
	great things. I owe so much of this to you, Kevin and your
	
Professional 
	Speakers Course  (and that is underplaying it)!" Adam Eason www.Adam-Eason.com

"Currently I am a high school senior that is 
		writing an essay on someone that has made an impact in society today 
		through their words. This essay is all about you. I stumbled upon your 
		site as a accident but what I found was absolutely amazing. The way you 
		were able to break down the human mind and then teach it to anyone and 
		everyone who wants to know is amazing. You have built confidence in 
		people's lives as well as contributed to the strengthening of our 
		society through common communication.. Your impact will be felt on 
		people as long as their is verbal and non verbal communication."

		Ryan Somers, Skyline High School, Sammamish, WA
"I recently purchased  Covert
      Hypnosis and absolutely love it. I sell security systems to small
      business owners. I was calling on a repair shop owner and after giving my
      presentation I asked for the sale. He said his budget was really tight now
      but call in 6 months. That's when I remembered what you taught and with
      only ONE sentence, I had the sale! It blew me away. Thank you, thank
      you!" Andy Howland Grand Rapids, MI 
"To
    say I "hired" Kevin is not accurate-he accepted me as a student in
    his Internet
    Marketing Course and
    promised [1] to give me more than I asked for; [2] to give me accurate, up
    date information that I could use for my own marketing projects; and [3] to
    tell me the truth. He did all three and much more without failure or
    hesitation. I would not hesitate to recommend Kevin; he CAN, he WILL, and he
    DOES deliver."JC MacKenzie RRT, RCP


		 


	"About halfway through your
    
Decision Point E-Course
 I really began to see a lot of new things.  
	Ive been using the ideas in the class on a regular basis now.  I 
	appreciate all the work to bring the course together."  Christian 
	Haller, Alexandria, VA
	 

    
	"I have had 
 

The New Hypnotherapy Handbook on my shelf for a year or two and 
		just started reading it...what a mistake I made! I should have picked it 
		up sooner, as it would have saved me and my clients time! I am a 
		subscriber to Coffee and really enjoy your stuff. Thank you, Kevin!" Michael Skirving,

"Kevin, I took a class of yours
years ago and you taught back then that the way to make money and get freedom
for yourself is to have your own small business. Well, I did it! I made money
for myself and was able to invest in a move to Ecuador. Money goes farther here!
I really live your message now. One can only have money and security when

"The 
	most remarkable thing about doing Kevin Hogan's 

Internet 
	Marketing Course was one week after 
	we started, I had a website up and running! This is not the usual type of 
	course where you receive all the subject matter and it sits on your shelf 
	until you find the time for it, oh, no! Kevin is involved. Every day he send 
	you emails with attachments. He takes you step by step through the process, 
	especially in the beginning when you really need it. It's in your best 
	interest to keep up with the group, and whatever questions you have, he 
	answers them all. You will receive absolutely everything you need to know 
	about the Internet. Something else that would never have happened without 
	Kevin, is that my website was spidered 4 days after it was 
	published, and spiders crawl every 3 or 4 days like clockwork. A 
	month later, my site had a page ranking of three. For a newcomer going it 
	alone, this is unheard of. The course was worth every penny. I highly 
	recommend it to anyone interested in setting up an Internet company, big or 
	small."
 Sharon Dell, Durban, South Africa, InspiringDevotional.com


 

Cosmopolitan
    
interviewed Kevin for an article on how to level the playing field in business 
for women. 


"I first gave Lifestorms
    a superficial listen, just curious what it was about, and at first I got
    nothing more out of it than a sense that it sounded cool. But, during the
    last 5 days, I have found the miracle! Something inside me clicked when I
    began to thoroughly study the material. I find myself interacting with the
    world as if I'm a new person. The best part is that this difference, this
    peace that I can not remember feeling before, this seems to be not from
    rational, "studied" or "memorized" knowledge, but a
    sense of freedom, a sense of a huge load falling off my shoulders, which I
    did not even know was there. What I have not mastered yet, I now know I will
    because of Lifestorms
    (Wow! Finally!) My friend and I, after the first 5 minutes five days ago,
    ever since that moment we can barely stop ourselves from discussing
    everything and we are excited to make time every day to study this, and we
    dislike the moment when we have to stop because we can barely wait to see
    what else is there!"  Katerina Spillkova, San Bruno, CA

	"Almost too deep to take in at one go around. So I've gone through 
	everything twice now and have a much clearer understanding. Amazing 
	information! Kevin, the
	
	Decision Point e-course is absolutely amazing. You have answered within 
	this course a lifelong question for me, 'Why are 95% of my decisions bad 
	ones?' As a matter of fact I'd finally gotten to the point in life where I 
	would make a decision and then do the opposite, which seemed to be a method 
	for better results...sad isn't it. So why did I mostly make bad decisions? 
	Because I was making them from my gut feeling. It's amazing that I've been 
	able to become a multimillionaire using this poor strategy. Now I truly feel 
	you have given me the opportunity to skyrocket my future. Thank you so much 
	Kevin, your work is truly phenomenal. Without question I'd recommend this 
	course to friend and foe alike." Kate Upchurch, Richardson, Texas

The Science of Influence, Part V Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence (Audio CD Volumes 49-60) 
Released January 14, 2007!
New Program!
It’s here!
I’m very excited.
I didn’t release a Science of Influence set in 2006 because I wanted this one to be something special…
I wanted THIS to be the one everyone remembers.
Science of Influence 49-60: Triggering Compliance in The Buying Sequence is something that I’m more than proud of than…well…ok…not more than my kids… but you get the idea…it includes some of my finest work to date. I believe you will agree and profit significantly from what you find out.
12 HOURS of new information and we have some fun along the way. (Even a couple of gaffe’s are left in, like when I accidentally said something I probably shouldn’t have…!)
The one area I’ve left open for speculation in the first 48 CD’s, I’ve closed in Science of Influence 49-60.
Impulse Activation moves your hand from their pocket to the shelf holding the magazines, candy bars and nail clippers when you’re in line waiting to check out your stuff at the store.
Impulse Activation is what causes you to push “Buy Now” instead of surf away to a different web page.
Impulse Activation is what causes you to give a meaningful contribution to a charity even when you considered to not do so.
And almost no one is able to INTENTIONALLY cause Impulse Activation.
Except You.
I’ve taken a decade of research and put it all to the task of Impulse Activation.
I invest five hours of Science of Influence showing you specific words and simple examples of how to use the most complex research. I even write out short ads and explain why they work or don’t.
I show you the Covert Psychological Triggers that are the most likely to succeed and then I show you HOW to use them.
Then I take you into the world of women. No one has ever written about the Covert Psychological Triggers that CAUSE women to act or decide in your favor.
I have.
I take you through step-by-step and itemize those Triggers, then, I show you the EXACT WORDS and PHRASES that work when communicating with women. To my knowledge, no one has ever done this before.
And there is a lot more.
In the last year there has been a LOT of research done in what persuades people…in what unspoken (covert) factors CAUSE people to spend more money, come back more often, buy more products and services.
And I lay it out for you in easy-to-understand fashion.
AND when appropriate I take you through cutting-edge research that I promise you won’t find anywhere else.
In fact, you probably won’t find ANY of this instantly practical and useful information available from others teaching persuasion, influence, selling or advertising for another year or two.
(It always helps to be first….)
Impulse Activation is Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence…Now.
Science of Influence 49-60: Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence is one of the finest programs I have ever created.
Some will probably say it is “the best.”
Learn the secrets of covert influence, the latest persuasion research that no one else has (including HOW to sell to women!) and subtle forms of influence I’ve never talked about anywhere before.
Almost all of the information you experience in this program is new. It’s not in any of my books. It’s not in the Covert Hypnosis CD program. It’s not in the previous Science of Influence series. (And vice versa of course!)
This CD program is hot off the presses and contains demonstrations of nonverbal and verbal communication that you haven’t seen or experienced before.
You will learn how to use Covert Psychological Triggers. This necessary skill set is what separates those who are good at subtle influence… and those that are truly masters. And I walk you through them, demo them and show you exactly how to do the same. You will be blown away. Promise. And because I present you with SO MANY Covert Psychological Triggers, we have included a handy TRIGGERS Reference Sheet that you will refer to again and again!
Turn the CD program off after this CD and you will have one heck of a return on your investment. (I promise when you see what happens when you use triggers and experience the Impulse to Action you will be more than impressed.)
You’ll learn how to cause uncontrollable impulses in seconds.
You’ll learn how to change memory.
It’s subtle.
It’s powerful.
Oh…and I’ll tell you why you want and need to know this….
Next you’re going to find out the seemingly magical use of energy around you to create incredible comfort and trust or discomfort and fear. I would argue that it isn’t magic, that it’s science but no time for that. The skills are all transferable.
You’re going to find out how to shape beliefs with single words or images.
You are going to learn how to get from “no” to “yes.”
You are going to see feel the energy vibrate off of me and feel it enter your mind as you learn to cause the Impulse to Action.
You will learn how to send covert verbal messages with far more power than you ever learned in NLP. (Yeah…really.)
*EVERYTHING* in these 12 content-packed hours of new material has been scientifically tested.
No guess work. No BS. No time wasters. It’s 100% proven technology.
And it’s 100% heart.
You will have fun and learn at the same time.
Unlike most programs you listen to, I explain EVERYTHING I DO.
It’s all here for you.
This program, just released, comes on 12 audio CD’s. It’s everything that you’ve ever dreamed of INCLUDING the manual which is rich in research and YES, the use of exact words and phrases for influencing when possible.
You are the first to have this incredible program and I am proud that you will.
Because as you come to understand the mind of the other person; you’ll also be learning :
How to create the “gotta have it” feeling in consumers
How to melt away sales resistance
How to tap into the “primal” buying emotions
How to literally and instantly establish rapport
How to ’cause’ consumers to obey your hidden ‘sales push’
How to infuse “proof power” into your sales letters
How to arouse your prospect’s inner buying drives
How to influence your prospect&#65533;s mind to trust you
How to bypass your prospect’s conscious mind
In a nutshell, you’ll learn how to create influential messages that hold customers captive from the first words you say to the signing of the check.
In Science of Influence 49-60 you will learn how to:
Cause Them to Identify with You
Combine Two Key Drivers that Will Cause Compulsion to Comply
Form Questions that Will Cause Compliance When Asked
Never Have That “Phoney Feeling” Inside Again…and Instantly Watch Your Income Increase
Use the Power of the Invisibility Intensifier
Take Advantage of Kevin’s Full Christmas Tree Technique
Optimize the Use of Their Feeling of Fear
AND…
Determine Which of the Five Basic Fears to Utilize in Your Presentation or Copy
Adopt Key Characteristics of God that Make You More Persuasive (even if you are Agnostic!)
Use Features instead of Benefits to Close The Deal
Send The Energy of Being THE Problem Solver to Those You Influence
Use Sex and Sensuality to Sell. Clear and Simple
Modify Old Sales Strategies to Become Influential in 2007
Be THE Person That Imbues Them With Good Feelings…They Won’t Want You to Leave!
Link Good Feelings with Buying Now
PLUS…
* Take Advantage of The Impulse to Instant Gratification With You, Your Product and Service
Building Trust and Credibility is one of the most difficult things for ANYONE to do. I’ve put together some very EASY methods for you to accelerate the process to almost instantaneous. BUT please do note, that getting trust and credibility immediately does have a danger. If you don’t deliver, you will lose. If you can deliver, you will be have a bonded relationship forever. This alone is worth far more than the tiny investment in Science of Influence: Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence
I’ll show you how to do it…don’t abuse it…
I’m also going to teach you a few of my personal favorite Impulse Activators including:
The “I’m an Idiot” Trigger. (Oddly irresistible)
The Single Word Strategy that CAUSES compliance NOW
The Non-Competition Technique that creates Long-Term Connections Between You and Your Client
The “It’s A Fact Because I Said It’s a Fact” Tactic
The Power of Impulse Activation is that in most cases it moves the person past skepticism and criticality….almost instantly.
I’m going to compare messages verbally and in text for you. I’m going to show you what works and what doesn’t verbally, and in writing.
Nuances make HUGE differences.
I watch people use the right tone of voice and great body language and get a “no” because they blew it with words.
Even more often I observe people saying the right words but completely screwing up because their tonality and pitch of voice offend the other person.
I’ll show you how to do it right…
And I’ll show you how to do things that everyone else told you not to.
I’ll show you HOW and WHEN to use LOGIC in the buying sequence.
I’ll show you WHEN to be politically correct and when not to.
I’ll show YOU how to INFLUENCE WOMEN (in-depth, like I’ve never done before!)

Women react and respond VERY DIFFERENTLY than men to influence attempts.
The chances are very good that your business is HEAVILY WEIGHTED with either 80% male or 80% female clients and customers.
I’m going to show you how to gain compliance from the women you’ve been missing out on.
I’ll give you THE EXACT WORDS that are REQUIRED to influence and sell women.
I will show you the PRECISE ATTITUDE that is REQUIRED to market effectively to women.
You’re going to have it all in Science of Influence: Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence.

Kevin Hogan – Covert Influence: The Hidden Persuaders
Price : $249
Just pay : $52
Product Desc ription: 7 CDs converted to MP3 at 160k.
1 PDF updated with bookmarks and covers.
Covert Influence:
The Hidden Persuaders…
Strategies No One Has Ever Even Thought Of
The research unveils what works and what doesn’t, and I’m ready to share it with you…
Are you ready for it? Study after study shows that tapping into human emotions is tantamount to success!
What are the details?
On 7 CD’s you can listen again and again to burn these new concepts, skills and tools into your mind.
Never before released on audio or in book form, this information is
freshly tested and scientifically validated.
Changing Minds with New Mental Technology is now required. This is the Genesis of that Mental Technology.
If you remotely wonder if that statement is correct, think about all of the money major corporations spent on advertising, marketing, promotion, sales and they are now bankrupt.
…It takes specialized knowledge and “digging deeper” to get where you need to go these days…
Getting people to “yes,” has never been more difficult in your lifetime than it is in 2009. It’s going to be more difficult as people’s innate defense mechanisms create a shell around their decision making faculty.
…What Does This Mean for You?
“Delay”, “wait”, “not yet”, “being careful”, “I’ll think about it”, and all of the other “tomorrow” messages are emanating from all directions.
I tried to fit this on 6 CD’s so it would fit the containers we invested in.
No luck! (Fortunately for you.)
This is a lot of information and it just got a little bigger than I guessed.
How “good” is this program?
It’s on par with my best work.
No one else has this information except, now… you.

I want to show you one of the most surprising and perhaps one of the uncomfortable….powerful phenomenon in Covert Influence.
In fact, I want to share with you all the latest research available (well, almost all…!)
Influence Without Resistance. What’s the Key Factor? You’ll have most amazing, truly stunning tactics in predicting what and how your client (spouse, child, customer, read: anyone) will choose. Thus, you are a step ahead of anyone else in implementing the most powerful phenomena in consumer research today. Find out with this program!
Creating Irresistible Impulse. The button is there (for everyone); it just needs to be pushed. What are some of the irresistible impulses marketers are using on you? How can you take advantage of these tactics yourself? It’s all here in this section. Kevin details the marketing phenomenon that pushes the buttons…all the way to irresistible.
Tapping into Human Desires & Emotions. With just ONE change in strategy, a non-profit organization can get 5 times the donations. What can this strategy do for you? You can’t afford NOT to implement this tactic now.
Desires and Emotions… That Influence. You’ve heard some rumors, I’m sure about negative emotions and positive emotions in the influence process. But do you know what actually works, and what to emphasize in the process, and when? Find out once and for all!
Tribes. You’ve heard the term. What does it describe? How does it come into play in the influence process? Most important, how do you utilize the concept of the Tribe in order to make more sales? It’s all here… Kevin explains about subgroups and how to make appeals based on whether a group is “in” or “out”. This is cutting edge research that benefits you.
Covert Influence…to Control Behavior. You’ve seen the signs. Above the candy jar, tacked to the break room wall. Even posted on a fence, or highway. How do signs really influence? What elements should be used in signs to covertly control behavior? Fascinating new research uncovered for you!
Plus…
Number of Choices Influences…
The Power of Interruption
Surprise and Novelty Influences…
The Power of Words…and SO MUCH MORE!

Kevin Hogan – Science of Influence V
Price : $297
Just pay : $52
The Science of Influence, Part V Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence (Audio CD Volumes 49-60) 
Released January 14, 2007!
New Program!
It’s here!
I’m very excited.
I didn’t release a Science of Influence set in 2006 because I wanted this one to be something special…
I wanted THIS to be the one everyone remembers.
Science of Influence 49-60: Triggering Compliance in The Buying Sequence is something that I’m more than proud of than…well…ok…not more than my kids… but you get the idea…it includes some of my finest work to date. I believe you will agree and profit significantly from what you find out.
12 HOURS of new information and we have some fun along the way. (Even a couple of gaffe’s are left in, like when I accidentally said something I probably shouldn’t have…!)
The one area I’ve left open for speculation in the first 48 CD’s, I’ve closed in Science of Influence 49-60.
Impulse Activation moves your hand from their pocket to the shelf holding the magazines, candy bars and nail clippers when you’re in line waiting to check out your stuff at the store.
Impulse Activation is what causes you to push “Buy Now” instead of surf away to a different web page.
Impulse Activation is what causes you to give a meaningful contribution to a charity even when you considered to not do so.
And almost no one is able to INTENTIONALLY cause Impulse Activation.
Except You.
I’ve taken a decade of research and put it all to the task of Impulse Activation.
I invest five hours of Science of Influence showing you specific words and simple examples of how to use the most complex research. I even write out short ads and explain why they work or don’t.
I show you the Covert Psychological Triggers that are the most likely to succeed and then I show you HOW to use them.
Then I take you into the world of women. No one has ever written about the Covert Psychological Triggers that CAUSE women to act or decide in your favor.
I have.
I take you through step-by-step and itemize those Triggers, then, I show you the EXACT WORDS and PHRASES that work when communicating with women. To my knowledge, no one has ever done this before.
And there is a lot more.
In the last year there has been a LOT of research done in what persuades people…in what unspoken (covert) factors CAUSE people to spend more money, come back more often, buy more products and services.
And I lay it out for you in easy-to-understand fashion.
AND when appropriate I take you through cutting-edge research that I promise you won’t find anywhere else.
In fact, you probably won’t find ANY of this instantly practical and useful information available from others teaching persuasion, influence, selling or advertising for another year or two.
(It always helps to be first….)
Impulse Activation is Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence…Now.
Science of Influence 49-60: Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence is one of the finest programs I have ever created.
Some will probably say it is “the best.”
Learn the secrets of covert influence, the latest persuasion research that no one else has (including HOW to sell to women!) and subtle forms of influence I’ve never talked about anywhere before.
Almost all of the information you experience in this program is new. It’s not in any of my books. It’s not in the Covert Hypnosis CD program. It’s not in the previous Science of Influence series. (And vice versa of course!)
This CD program is hot off the presses and contains demonstrations of nonverbal and verbal communication that you haven’t seen or experienced before.
You will learn how to use Covert Psychological Triggers. This necessary skill set is what separates those who are good at subtle influence… and those that are truly masters. And I walk you through them, demo them and show you exactly how to do the same. You will be blown away. Promise. And because I present you with SO MANY Covert Psychological Triggers, we have included a handy TRIGGERS Reference Sheet that you will refer to again and again!
Turn the CD program off after this CD and you will have one heck of a return on your investment. (I promise when you see what happens when you use triggers and experience the Impulse to Action you will be more than impressed.)
You’ll learn how to cause uncontrollable impulses in seconds.
You’ll learn how to change memory.
It’s subtle.
It’s powerful.
Oh…and I’ll tell you why you want and need to know this….
Next you’re going to find out the seemingly magical use of energy around you to create incredible comfort and trust or discomfort and fear. I would argue that it isn’t magic, that it’s science but no time for that. The skills are all transferable.
You’re going to find out how to shape beliefs with single words or images.
You are going to learn how to get from “no” to “yes.”
You are going to see feel the energy vibrate off of me and feel it enter your mind as you learn to cause the Impulse to Action.
You will learn how to send covert verbal messages with far more power than you ever learned in NLP. (Yeah…really.)
*EVERYTHING* in these 12 content-packed hours of new material has been scientifically tested.
No guess work. No BS. No time wasters. It’s 100% proven technology.
And it’s 100% heart.
You will have fun and learn at the same time.
Unlike most programs you listen to, I explain EVERYTHING I DO.
It’s all here for you.
This program, just released, comes on 12 audio CD’s. It’s everything that you’ve ever dreamed of INCLUDING the manual which is rich in research and YES, the use of exact words and phrases for influencing when possible.
You are the first to have this incredible program and I am proud that you will.
Because as you come to understand the mind of the other person; you’ll also be learning :
How to create the “gotta have it” feeling in consumers
How to melt away sales resistance
How to tap into the “primal” buying emotions
How to literally and instantly establish rapport
How to ’cause’ consumers to obey your hidden ‘sales push’
How to infuse “proof power” into your sales letters
How to arouse your prospect’s inner buying drives
How to influence your prospect&#65533;s mind to trust you
How to bypass your prospect’s conscious mind
In a nutshell, you’ll learn how to create influential messages that hold customers captive from the first words you say to the signing of the check.
In Science of Influence 49-60 you will learn how to:
Cause Them to Identify with You
Combine Two Key Drivers that Will Cause Compulsion to Comply
Form Questions that Will Cause Compliance When Asked
Never Have That “Phoney Feeling” Inside Again…and Instantly Watch Your Income Increase
Use the Power of the Invisibility Intensifier
Take Advantage of Kevin’s Full Christmas Tree Technique
Optimize the Use of Their Feeling of Fear
AND…
Determine Which of the Five Basic Fears to Utilize in Your Presentation or Copy
Adopt Key Characteristics of God that Make You More Persuasive (even if you are Agnostic!)
Use Features instead of Benefits to Close The Deal
Send The Energy of Being THE Problem Solver to Those You Influence
Use Sex and Sensuality to Sell. Clear and Simple
Modify Old Sales Strategies to Become Influential in 2007
Be THE Person That Imbues Them With Good Feelings…They Won’t Want You to Leave!
Link Good Feelings with Buying Now
PLUS…
* Take Advantage of The Impulse to Instant Gratification With You, Your Product and Service
Building Trust and Credibility is one of the most difficult things for ANYONE to do. I’ve put together some very EASY methods for you to accelerate the process to almost instantaneous. BUT please do note, that getting trust and credibility immediately does have a danger. If you don’t deliver, you will lose. If you can deliver, you will be have a bonded relationship forever. This alone is worth far more than the tiny investment in Science of Influence: Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence
I’ll show you how to do it…don’t abuse it…
I’m also going to teach you a few of my personal favorite Impulse Activators including:
The “I’m an Idiot” Trigger. (Oddly irresistible)
The Single Word Strategy that CAUSES compliance NOW
The Non-Competition Technique that creates Long-Term Connections Between You and Your Client
The “It’s A Fact Because I Said It’s a Fact” Tactic
The Power of Impulse Activation is that in most cases it moves the person past skepticism and criticality….almost instantly.
I’m going to compare messages verbally and in text for you. I’m going to show you what works and what doesn’t verbally, and in writing.
Nuances make HUGE differences.
I watch people use the right tone of voice and great body language and get a “no” because they blew it with words.
Even more often I observe people saying the right words but completely screwing up because their tonality and pitch of voice offend the other person.
I’ll show you how to do it right…
And I’ll show you how to do things that everyone else told you not to.
I’ll show you HOW and WHEN to use LOGIC in the buying sequence.
I’ll show you WHEN to be politically correct and when not to.
I’ll show YOU how to INFLUENCE WOMEN (in-depth, like I’ve never done before!)
The Science of Influence 49-60: Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence is UTTERLY UNIQUE among all programs about persuasion and selling.
Because, for the first time, you will find out EXACTLY how to influence women. (Whether you are a man or a woman doesn’t matter. What matters is how you will use what you discover here!)
Women react and respond VERY DIFFERENTLY than men to influence attempts.
The chances are very good that your business is HEAVILY WEIGHTED with either 80% male or 80% female clients and customers.
I’m going to show you how to gain compliance from the women you’ve been missing out on.
I’ll give you THE EXACT WORDS that are REQUIRED to influence and sell women.
I will show you the PRECISE ATTITUDE that is REQUIRED to market effectively to women.

“Imagine…in Every Interaction in the Real World or Online, How Would Your Life Be Different If People Were Desperate to Instantly Say ‘Yes’ to You?”
The Persuasion Protocol by Kevin Hogan
Use the “Add to Cart” Button Below
Automatic Compliance is the stuff of science fiction. It simply sounds too good (too scary) to be true…
It seems instantly unreasonable that you could have the same (more precisely: similar) effect on that person… over there… as say, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, or Kim Kardashian would.
Humans are neurobiologically wired to react INSTANTLY to TWO specific Flash Perceptions when they see anyone.
Instant In-Group Recognition: Triggering, “All is Safe and Secure, Allow Entrance, Interactions Are to My Benefit.”
Attractiveness: (which triggers one of these) “I want them. I want to be seen with them. I want to be seen and liked by them. I want to be near them. I want them to want to be near me.”
IF you don’t generate that instant flash, reactance and resistance occur and the most likely response is always. “No.”
Until TODAY, literally, no one has ever released a program, a book, a manual, a video…no one has shown you anything ever that, “generates the Automatic First Reaction of Certainty, which yields, “yes, come in, I am comfortable with you, I feel like I’ve known you forever and I’m open to pretty much anything.”
Why?
Because until the last decade there were 100 pieces of research about attractiveness and liking compared to every 1 piece of research on generating instant calm, security, comfort and connection.
In the last few years this has begun to change because of major technological advances in neurobiology and nonconscious and subliminal stimulation. Yet nothing shows the individual, the salesperson, sales letter writer, the marketer, even the PUA how to assemble The Five Elements into one workable easy to use method…The Persuasion Protocol.
The two nonconscious neural responses are DIFFERENT from each other. They accomplish the same crucial result. They open the door to agreement and compliance. The benefit of their certainty reaction is that it doesn’t operate if there is reactance or resistance. The negative reactant response is far and away the most common, and only attractiveness counters it in a fashion similar to that of certainty.
You’ll learn how that happens and how to make it real in the program.

For the first time ever, you are on the same playing field as the wickedly good looking guy or gal who gets the majority of the sales.
That was my goal in creating this program for you.
It has been accomplished….
The Persuasion Protocol
The Fifth Element
You’ve waited over one year for this and it has just arrived. You’ll understand the delay when you listen to the program. You’ll notice my voice “changes” within individual CD’s because I had a serious vocal cord problem and had to re-record many tracks so you wouldn’t think I was the bass singer in some musical group. I was only supposed to record short clips daily but that didn’t quite happen.
The Persuasion Protocol takes you through an elegant step-by-step method of gaining compliance from almost anyone you could ever imagine wanting to say “yes” to you. It’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen or experienced before.
Unlike any program ever developed in the field of influence and persuasion or selling, you will begin by making your Self almost impossible to say “no” to…you.
Persuasion begins before you walk in the door.
The actual process of persuasion begins long before you meet the girl or have an appointment with the buyer. Persuading those who come to your website begins before they arrive at your website.
“Are you talking about preparing for the sale? I know about that…”
….uh….no…that was 1997.
“Are you talking about making yourself look as attractive as you can?”
…again…no…no…no…The Persuasion Protocol transcends attractiveness.
But don’t get me wrong. If you look like Angelina or Brad….you will have a double advantage. If you are like anyone else, you simply have the only single advantage you would ever need or want.
The First Element
I’ve spent the last 17 months scouring crucial neuroscience research, poring through consumer, marketing and behavioral findings so that you can have a complete “package” that people instantly say “yes” to *before* that first impression.
Understand…while your mastery of body language and nonverbal communication are important, it is secondary and not as important by comparison to your preparing THEIR BRAIN to instantly opt to comply with you upon first sight and communication.
…sounds like magic to me…but I promise it’s not.
It’s also *not* instantly easy and “fast.” It IS something you can accomplish. It is something you MUST accomplish.
Use the “Add to Cart” Button Below
I’ll spare you the scientific jargon and say it this way:
People have prior experience with thousands of people. They have interactions with people who they live(d) with whom they have spent a great deal of time. Those experiences each are very different and when presented with a similar moment in time, the parts of the brain that reacted to similar situations in the past arise instantly in the present ready to solve the problems and fight the fights of the past.
And that is the problem.
Before people see you, your website, or even know you exist, they are 100% prepared for who you are *not* going to be after you have completed this program.
I’ve developed a very simple process that requires 19 days to complete. It will permanently change how people will react and respond to you in the situations they would have said, “no” in the past.
The problem you face is that people paint a picture of you as if you are a mirror reflection of their past experience.
Upon meeting you or arriving at your website, it is Mission Critical to have that reflection CHANGED to a picture of a gestalt of those they have complied with in the past.
This seemingly Herculean task, assuming they are undistracted, must take place in approximately one second.
The first two discs of this program cover quite a bit of persuasive territory. The first core experience is for you to intentionally create a few micro-tweaks in how you will trigger reactions in other people on sight and then later in conversation or in text.
Would people instantly react differently to you if they saw you as Brad Pitt, Lucy Pinder, Angelina Jolie, Kat Dennings, Jessica Alba?
It’s a different set of highways in the brain, but for the purpose of this moment, go with that.
Their brain is simply wired “this way.”
How?
They would be mentally prepared to comply or agree to pretty much anything you ask them.
Problem?
Yes.
I can’t make you look like Brad….I can’t make ME look like Brad…
Doesn’t matter.
There is another way…
This initial trigger is crucial or they will react to you in such a way that is similar to:

a) how you have triggered people in the past
b) how they have perceived people, now gestalted into “you,” in similar situations in the past…even if they’ve never met you, heard you speak, been to your website or had a clue you were alive.

I will show you *precisely* how to take the video recording of your life and change the few crucial pieces where other people were triggered to say “no” to you in such a way that those experiences are no longer reflected in your personality, persona, your face or even your body language. As you guessed, this has nothing to do with making changes in body language. This is changing a few tiny little pieces of you that trigger mirror neurons to react in others.
This is not a bogus NLP “technique” that never got tested. This shifting mechanism was trial and errored until the right solution was discovered in testing. In other words, this is real.
Where you currently have success in influencing others, you make no changes. In these situations your current beliefs, certainties and behaviors are already effective.
Where you haven’t been ideally successful with persuasion, you will excise a few pieces of your life video recording so that you send a custom designed message with greater likelihood for others to say “yes,” to you. Isolating the specific points to shift is not difficult and the process is fairly simple.
Warning: This is not like Instant Coffee. It takes effort. But, once the change is made, it’s permanent.
The result is that you’ll see most people and their likely response to you through a lens of high certainty and reduce internal triggers to move away from you to almost nil.
You now begin to shape all people who you come across in the way you choose instead of default, which is indeed a fault.
The Second Element
The Protocol for effective and rapid persuasion flows fluidly, easily and obviously to the Second Element.
Here you learn to control the time constructs each person has as it relates to their being persuaded by you. You must choose precisely when you are going to approach, meet, ask for the date or have people arrive at your website. The arrival time is crucial and you can pre-determine whether you are virtually certain to gain compliance or not quite easily BEFORE you enter their space.
The Second Element is not limited to “what time is it,” but “what day is it,” “what date is it,” “what month is it,” and how you account for the differences in how they will react to you on each of those specific days, hours, weeks and months. Once you learn to utilize this one very easy to grasp tool, you will never be seen quite the same.
Their reaction to you and their compliance or not, is much more than about your “first impression” or your what you say. It’s about a very specific individual with a specific mindset interacting with you at an absolutely optimum time.
I’ve left nothing to chance here. I’ve put the factors of the Second Element together into a template and laid it out for you for an hourly, daily, weekly and even monthly schedule of how to optimize all of your interactions with brilliant timing intention.

It’s here that you’ll be introduced to the unknown factor that stops persuasion cold and discover how to completely bypass it!
I’ve only shown three corporations how to do this. I’ve never trained it in Boot Camp. No one else has put this into interactions, sales, marketing…no one. This is brand new for you.
The Third Element
It is no coincidence that most of the successful online marketers have strong backgrounds in two specific and, frankly, not easy to master hypnosis models. Drawing from even simple but powerful hypnotic techniques has allowed marketers to target states of mind or subroutines within individuals to increase sales.
But before you can use these techniques, you have to learn how to cause someone to be in a specific state of mind. Random doesn’t work beyond random. Feeble attempts typically fail. Now you learn what…and how.
Different “sub-selves” (the actual neurobiological term) are activated in different environments and in the presence of different people. This is why it is CRITICAL to make instant shifts in environment, location, people and triggers in the environment a key factor in The Third Element of The Persuasion Protocol.
Equally as important is you being aware of how you are perceived at any moment of an interaction.
The Passive Goal Guidance System
Running Their Brain and Shifting Their Selves
You can predict behavior when you recognize “the state,” the part, that is forward in their brain.
If your prediction is that compliance will fail, you CHANGE what part of them is forward until you can gain compliance.
The first state or part will likely be forward until the Passive Goal Guidance System has met a tiny goal and switches out. Now you learn how to optimize the use of anyone’s PGGS for Rapid Compliance.
The Fourth Element
Without question, the great marketing and sales discoveries of the last decade are those that give you applications to synchronize identities with another individual. This can be true in face to face communication, writing sales letters and direct mail…in fact…it’s applicable to texting and social media.
The Fourth Element is fusing bonds with their most secret identity.
Without question The Greatest Marketing Study Ever Done allows you to see the results of connecting with that hidden identity. Ironically, no one has even remotely heard of this study inside the world of salespeople and marketers. Strange that you’ll now possess the knowledge of what was discovered works in marketing…and what doesn’t…and specific implementation points for you.
50,000 people were involved in this study. A record. And you have the results.
The Fifth Element
Like the first four elements, The Fifth Element is new to your understanding of persuasion.
Behavior Guidance and Compliance Discovering and then shifting their Identification Protocol is something no one has talked about in the real world. The reason is that it’s one of those things no one wants to talk about. Causing people to do what you want to is very simple when you understand and work within their Identity as it intersects with yours.
The Emotional Shift Protocol
People’s bias toward certain behaviors is very predictable.
Example: The Optimistic individual meets their inner drive to maintain the Status Quo with behaviors that you can predict and control. These biases meet head on their bias toward over estimation creating frustration, anger and other emotions that can be remarkably valuable in the persuasion process if you know what to do with them…saving the best for last….
The Great 21st Century Influence Study(s) Results are Yours – No one Else has them….
The most important influence study of this century gives you specific actions to take to influence others. Then you learn precisely what not to do and how to use this in many different contexts. Absolutely brilliant in scope and magnitude with the side effect being that people report they don’t even remember what caused them to behave differently!
“Peruasion Protocol contains extensive and up to date research about persuasion and marketing. Kevin Hogan overdelivers in terms of massive content and utterly applicable stories, metaphors and ideas about persuasion. I view Kevin as my back-up research expert who affirms or negates the viewpoints that evolve in my clinical work as a psychotherapist. The only problem in buying anything by Kevin Hogan is that it is humbling to see how much he gets done and all that he knows. However, you will know far more and be far more productive when you listen to this program and put it into practice. It is worth all the time and money you put into it.” Bob Beverley, Psychotherapist, www.findwisdomnow.com
New Strategies Never Before Seen
This program is not only unique to my work but also to the field of influence, persuasion, sales and marketing. That means that for the most part, not only is this “new” but the interaction between the Five Elements is absolutely singular in power.
I guarantee you’ll be the first person (as will the others who get this program…it’s not really JUST you and me) to have this. It’s far beyond “cutting edge.”
Do PRECISELY what you are instructed to do in The Persuasion Protocol and you will own your Self and you will own their reaction and response to you.
It is difficult to construct scenarios where The Persuasion Protocol is ineffective because it was designed to loop to agreement. There is no real Test/Exit/Fail option in the system.
It’s simply the most potent information about persuasion ever prepared for anyone.
This doesn’t mean someone isn’t going to say “no” to you at some point. You might step over a line that someone else won’t ever cross under any circumstances. But because of the methodology, you wouldn’t go there in the first place because it offers a significantly possible response of “no.”
The program is a bit over 10 hours and uses 10 CD’s.
There is an extremely important 69 page Guide on CD as well. IF you do what is in the guide in ADDITION to what you learn in the CD’s, you’ll have a brilliant story to tell me the next time we see each other.
If you don’t use the manual with the CD’s at least ONCE you’ve missed the boat. There are actions you must take outside of your University on Wheels for this to all coalesce.
You can now pick up the program at a significantly reduced price and have the finest persuasion program ever developed. You’ll see your personal effectiveness, charisma, persona grow by leaps.
The Persuasion Protocol by Kevin Hogan Why do this?
The Persuasion Protocol is unique. You don’t have this. No one has this.
It will not be sold at a lower price at any point in the next several years. An opportunity to acquire the course at a lower cost in some future promotion this year will not happen.
Listen to The Persuasion Protocol as often as you can.
You’ll never have invested your dollars in such a profound fashion.
The ROI will occur as quickly as you choose it to happen.

Description




Kevin Hogan – Science of Influence V
The Science of Influence, Part V Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence (Audio CD Volumes 49-60)
Released January 14, 2007!
New Program!
It’s here!
I’m very excited.
I didn’t release a Science of Influence set in 2006 because I wanted this one to be something special…
I wanted THIS to be the one everyone remembers.
Science of Influence 49-60: Triggering Compliance in The Buying Sequence is something that I’m more than proud of than…well…ok…not more than my kids… but you get the idea…it includes some of my finest work to date. I believe you will agree and profit significantly from what you find out.
12 HOURS of new information and we have some fun along the way. (Even a couple of gaffe’s are left in, like when I accidentally said something I probably shouldn’t have…!)
The one area I’ve left open for speculation in the first 48 CD’s, I’ve closed in Science of Influence 49-60.
Impulse Activation moves your hand from their pocket to the shelf holding the magazines, candy bars and nail clippers when you’re in line waiting to check out your stuff at the store.
Impulse Activation is what causes you to push “Buy Now” instead of surf away to a different web page.
Impulse Activation is what causes you to give a meaningful contribution to a charity even when you considered to not do so.
And almost no one is able to INTENTIONALLY cause Impulse Activation.
Except You.
I’ve taken a decade of research and put it all to the task of Impulse Activation.
I invest five hours of Science of Influence showing you specific words and simple examples of how to use the most complex research. I even write out short ads and explain why they work or don’t.
I show you the Covert Psychological Triggers that are the most likely to succeed and then I show you HOW to use them.
Then I take you into the world of women. No one has ever written about the Covert Psychological Triggers that CAUSE women to act or decide in your favor.
I have.
I take you through step-by-step and itemize those Triggers, then, I show you the EXACT WORDS and PHRASES that work when communicating with women. To my knowledge, no one has ever done this before.
And there is a lot more.
In the last year there has been a LOT of research done in what persuades people…in what unspoken (covert) factors CAUSE people to spend more money, come back more often, buy more products and services.
And I lay it out for you in easy-to-understand fashion.
AND when appropriate I take you through cutting-edge research that I promise you won’t find anywhere else.
In fact, you probably won’t find ANY of this instantly practical and useful information available from others teaching persuasion, influence, selling or advertising for another year or two.
(It always helps to be first….)
Impulse Activation is Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence…Now.
Science of Influence 49-60: Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence is one of the finest programs I have ever created.
Some will probably say it is “the best.”
Learn the secrets of covert influence, the latest persuasion research that no one else has (including HOW to sell to women!) and subtle forms of influence I’ve never talked about anywhere before.
Almost all of the information you experience in this program is new. It’s not in any of my books. It’s not in the Covert Hypnosis CD program. It’s not in the previous Science of Influence series. (And vice versa of course!)
This CD program is hot off the presses and contains demonstrations of nonverbal and verbal communication that you haven’t seen or experienced before.
You will learn how to use Covert Psychological Triggers. This necessary skill set is what separates those who are good at subtle influence… and those that are truly masters. And I walk you through them, demo them and show you exactly how to do the same. You will be blown away. Promise. And because I present you with SO MANY Covert Psychological Triggers, we have included a handy TRIGGERS Reference Sheet that you will refer to again and again!
Turn the CD program off after this CD and you will have one heck of a return on your investment. (I promise when you see what happens when you use triggers and experience the Impulse to Action you will be more than impressed.)
You’ll learn how to cause uncontrollable impulses in seconds.
You’ll learn how to change memory.
It’s subtle.
It’s powerful.
Oh…and I’ll tell you why you want and need to know this….
Next you’re going to find out the seemingly magical use of energy around you to create incredible comfort and trust or discomfort and fear. I would argue that it isn’t magic, that it’s science but no time for that. The skills are all transferable.
You’re going to find out how to shape beliefs with single words or images.
You are going to learn how to get from “no” to “yes.”
You are going to see feel the energy vibrate off of me and feel it enter your mind as you learn to cause the Impulse to Action.
You will learn how to send covert verbal messages with far more power than you ever learned in NLP. (Yeah…really.)
*EVERYTHING* in these 12 content-packed hours of new material has been scientifically tested.
No guess work. No BS. No time wasters. It’s 100% proven technology.
And it’s 100% heart.
You will have fun and learn at the same time.
Unlike most programs you listen to, I explain EVERYTHING I DO.
It’s all here for you.
This program, just released, comes on 12 audio CD’s. It’s everything that you’ve ever dreamed of INCLUDING the manual which is rich in research and YES, the use of exact words and phrases for influencing when possible.
You are the first to have this incredible program and I am proud that you will.
Because as you come to understand the mind of the other person; you’ll also be learning :
How to create the “gotta have it” feeling in consumers
How to melt away sales resistance
How to tap into the “primal” buying emotions
How to literally and instantly establish rapport
How to ’cause’ consumers to obey your hidden ‘sales push’
How to infuse “proof power” into your sales letters
How to arouse your prospect’s inner buying drives
How to influence your prospect�s mind to trust you
How to bypass your prospect’s conscious mind
In a nutshell, you’ll learn how to create influential messages that hold customers captive from the first words you say to the signing of the check.
In Science of Influence 49-60 you will learn how to:
Cause Them to Identify with You
Combine Two Key Drivers that Will Cause Compulsion to Comply

Be THE Person That Imbues Them With Good Feelings…They Won’t Want You to Leave!

PLUS…
* Take Advantage of The Impulse to Instant Gratification With You, Your Product and Service
Building Trust and Credibility is one of the most difficult things for ANYONE to do. I’ve put together some very EASY methods for you to accelerate the process to almost instantaneous. BUT please do note, that getting trust and credibility immediately does have a danger. If you don’t deliver, you will lose. If you can deliver, you will be have a bonded relationship forever. This alone is worth far more than the tiny investment in Science of Influence: Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence
I’ll show you how to do it…don’t abuse it…
I’m also going to teach you a few of my personal favorite Impulse Activators including:
The “I’m an Idiot” Trigger. (Oddly irresistible)
The Single Word Strategy that CAUSES compliance NOW
The Non-Competition Technique that creates Long-Term Connections Between You and Your Client
The “It’s A Fact Because I Said It’s a Fact” Tactic
The Power of Impulse Activation is that in most cases it moves the person past skepticism and criticality….almost instantly.
I’m going to compare messages verbally and in text for you. I’m going to show you what works and what doesn’t verbally, and in writing.
Nuances make HUGE differences.
I watch people use the right tone of voice and great body language and get a “no” because they blew it with words.
Even more often I observe people saying the right words but completely screwing up because their tonality and pitch of voice offend the other person.
I’ll show you how to do it right…
And I’ll show you how to do things that everyone else told you not to.
I’ll show you HOW and WHEN to use LOGIC in the buying sequence.
I’ll show you WHEN to be politically correct and when not to.
I’ll show YOU how to INFLUENCE WOMEN (in-depth, like I’ve never done before!)
The Science of Influence 49-60: Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence is UTTERLY UNIQUE among all programs about persuasion and selling.
Because, for the first time, you will find out EXACTLY how to influence women. (Whether you are a man or a woman doesn’t matter. What matters is how you will use what you discover here!)
Women react and respond VERY DIFFERENTLY than men to influence attempts.
The chances are very good that your business is HEAVILY WEIGHTED with either 80% male or 80% female clients and customers.
I’m going to show you how to gain compliance from the women you’ve been missing out on.
I’ll give you THE EXACT WORDS that are REQUIRED to influence and sell women.
I will show you the PRECISE ATTITUDE that is REQUIRED to market effectively to women.
You’re going to have it all in Science of Influence: Triggering Compliance in the Buying Sequence.
