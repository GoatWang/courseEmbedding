Disclosures to third parties needed to service your account (such as providing information to auditors and tax service providers); and
Disclosures to third parties, who themselves are subject to confidentiality requirements, that perform or provide services for us or on our behalf involving your account information (such as technology consultants who assist us in maintaining or operating our computer and duplicating systems).

We maintain policies and procedures directed towards preserving the privacy of the personal information that we collect and maintain. These safeguards are designed to assure the security and confidentiality of your records and personal information, to protect against foreseeable threats or hazards to the security of this information and to protect against its unauthorized use.

We maintain policies and procedures directed towards preserving the privacy of the personal information that we collect and maintain. These safeguards are designed to assure the security and confidentiality of your records and personal information, to protect against foreseeable threats or hazards to the security of this information and to protect against its unauthorized use.

Rockefeller & Co. Participates in Operation Backpack 2016As part of our community outreach initiative, Rockefeller & Co. again participated in Operation Backpack 2016.Thousands of children live in New York City’s homeless and domestic violence shelters. One of the most devastating consequences of homelessness is the impact it has on a child's education.   Each year since 2001, Volunteers of America-Greater New York has been giving new backpacks filled with grade-specific school supplies to children who are homeless throughout New York City and in need school supplies for the upcoming school year. A filled backpack relieves parents of a financial burden and these children, who face otherwise chaotic lives, look and feel more like their classmates. Most importantly, a filled backpack allows these children to start the school year feeling prepared and confident, with the knowledge that their education is just as important.Thank you to everyone who donated; we collected over 50 backpacks for this year’s Operation Backpack.

People Spotlight
Elisabeth “Lisi” Madden, Vice President, Rockefeller Trust Company, N.A.
Elisabeth “Lisi” Madden, Vice President, Rockefeller Trust Company, N.A.French Influence: Lisi grew up in Manhattan and moved with her family to Paris, France at age eleven. Being exposed to a new culture at an early age taught Lisi a number of valuable lessons and skills, especially learning to speak French.  Her favorite memory of her time in France is visiting Provence in the springtime. Lisi and her family moved back to New York City after her freshman year of high school. On her time in Africa: After taking the bar exam, Lisi decided to take a little time off. Her idea of “time off,” however, was a tad more adventurous than others as she embarked on a journey to Africa. For a month, Lisi was hosted by a family in Arusha, Tanzania and spent time visiting various communities. On attending Law School at Vanderbilt University: Lisi loved everything about going to Law School in Nashville, Tennessee. One of her favorite places to spend time was the Blue Bird Café, which is an iconic spot that features performances by country music singers and songwriters. Perhaps this is why Lisi can always be found listening to country music; especially, George Strait, her favorite country singer.   On her favorite part of New York City: Brooklyn. Lisi laughed while explaining, “It feels like the suburbs to me.”Outside of work: Lisi is a mother to two children, ages five and three. She loves reading, spending time outdoors and running. Lisi modestly admitted that she competed in her first marathon while in college.    Favorite food: Just like her children, Lisi’s favorite foods are pizza and ice cream.  Why Trusts and Estates: Lisi enjoys the trusts and estates area of the law, as it involves not only the understanding of complex legal issues, but also requires substantial interactions with individuals and families.

Overview



Rockefeller & Co. serves individuals, families, and institutional investors whose focus on alpha generation requires an experienced partner with a demonstrable investment history. With more than 30 years of experience in global investing, we pair our distinctive worldview and long-term horizon with thorough research. Rockefeller Asset Management1 offers strategies whose performance over multiple market cycles, is driven by a disciplined process and our collaborative culture.
1Rockefeller Asset Management is a division of Rockefeller & Co., and the "Firm" for purposes of the Global Investment Performance Standards (“GIPS®”).


We offer the following strategies:
Equity
Fixed Income







Equity Strategies


Rockefeller Asset Management is guided by  the following core investment beliefs in its investing approach, and has followed these tenets for decades:

-	Market inefficiencies generally occur when investors:


Focus too much on short-term results
Lack a global perspective
Maintain behavioral biases, especially during periods of market extremes






-	Investment results are built on a long-term horizon, coupled with a global research framework and unbiased fundamental analysis

Our commitment to a respectful culture that encourages diversity and intense collaboration differentiates Rockefeller Asset Management as a firm. We believe the stability of our organization and the continuity of our investment professionals has been a key advantage to implementing our philosophy.









We’re not constrained by geography. We seek opportunities on behalf of our clients and do not replicate an index.”
– David P. Harris, CFAChief Investment Officer








The investment team’s approach to equities involves an analysis of prospective investments from the bottom up. Their fundamental analysis goes deeper than standard cash flow models, divisional analysis, and competitive evaluations. The team conducts their own proprietary research, which includes research trips and direct interactions with company executives.  Our collaborative culture and the preparedness and breadth of our research and analyses allows us to invest in ways that seek to take advantage of temporary market dislocations after thoroughly and patiently vetting a stock selection.
Our fundamental research process gathers both qualitative and quantitative data in seeking to identify companies with consistent growth, high returns on capital, and established barriers to competition.

Fixed Income Strategies


Rockefeller & Co. takes a thoughtful and prudent view to managing credit risk and interest rate risk in seeking to provide stability for our fixed income strategies. For taxable fixed income investments, we focus on investment grade bonds. Meanwhile, our tax-exempt security investments maintain a focus on higher quality municipal bonds backed by solid collateral.
Rockefeller & Co.’s fixed income strategies seek to generate current income and preserve principal. Rockefeller & Co.’s fixed income strategies consist of bonds, identified and vetted by our top-down and bottom-up research principles. Our fixed income team interacts with and shares the broad investment perspective of Rockefeller Asset Management’s senior investment professionals and our equity team.

Asset Management

Our ApproachOur ServicesOur Wealth Advisory Team





OurApproach
Rockefeller & Co. provides comprehensive wealth advisory services to help clients grow their assets, diversify their holdings, and maintain a legacy for future generations.
Our team has a deep understanding of the financial challenges facing individuals, families, family offices, foundations, endowments, and non-profit institutions.  Our advisory services are guided by our expertise in seeking to provide effective solutions that reflect the particular dynamics of a client’s specific circumstances.








OurServices


Driven by our commitment to client interests and by our independent, collaborative culture, Rockefeller & Co.’s range of services is designed to be comprehensive, yet customizable. We offer investment advisory, trust company, Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) services, and family office services in seeking to help clients meet their complex financial needs.







Wealth Planning




After a thorough review of a client’s circumstances and needs, our advisory team constructs an in-depth, actionable plan to address targeted goals. This service is customizable and may involve multiple disciplines, with a holistic perspective on identifying the most appropriate approach to pursue.
Rockefeller & Co. takes a long-term approach to wealth planning. While some individuals, families, family offices, foundations, endowments, and non-profit institutions tend to focus their financial efforts primarily on investment returns, we formulate approaches that seek to preserve wealth, help clients prepare for future needs, and assess legacy goals for future generations.  We apply our extensive experience across an integrated array of services:

Investment Advisory






Wendy XuInvestment Research Analyst



To help our clients pursue their investment goals, Rockefeller & Co. offers investment expertise and advice to personalize asset allocation and investment plans.
The core of our service is based on the objective investment advice we seek to provide, supported by an open-architecture wealth management platform.





Our Client ProcessFirst, Rockefeller & Co.’s wealth advisors help to identify a client’s goals. Through a review of the existing portfolio—followed by a consideration of cash flow needs, objectives, and risk tolerances—our team works with the client to develop a tailored approach which may, based on the client’s preferences, include developing an investment policy statement or enhancing a pre-existing policy statement.
Asset AllocationWe also help our clients decide on asset and style allocations. Our allocation recommendations may incorporate a variety of vehicles, including Rockefeller & Co.’s own investment strategies, our network of third party managers, mutual funds, ETFs, alternative strategies, private equity funds, and more as may be appropriate. As an independent investment adviser, we seek to provide strategy recommendations to our clients with their best interests in mind.






Equities
Rockefeller & Co.’s skilled and collaborative equity analysts and portfolio managers make decisions based on a global perspective and long-term objectives.






Fixed Income Securities
Rockefeller & Co.’s taxable fixed income strategy focuses on investment grade bonds. When considering tax-exempt securities, we focus on higher quality municipal bonds backed by solid collateral. Our overall objective for investing in fixed income securities is to generate current income and preserve principal income.




Mutual Funds
We maintain a platform of “long only” third party mutual funds, which include both active and passive strategies. For more information on the mutual fund platform, please click here.





Manager Selection and Outsourced Chief Investment Officer Services

Rockefeller & Co.’s independence as an investment advisory firm is an important component of our open architecture platform. Rockefeller & Co.’s advice is driven by an independent analysis of opportunities in line with our clients’ objectives, viewed within our long-term, global perspective.
Where appropriate, we seek to objectively identify the external resources (e.g., managers, strategies and funds) that we believe most effectively match a client’s needs. Furthermore, we believe that the results of our external search process is enhanced by the insight of our own seasoned asset management professionals.
Certain clients—including endowments, family offices, and both non-profit and for-profit institutions—may have needs that are well-suited for our OCIO services. In the OCIO dynamic, Rockefeller & Co. essentially becomes the de-facto investing function for the client.  We can provide OCIO services on either a discretionary or non-discretionary basis, with our focus on objective advice and risk management.
