Contests prizes trivia and more fire rapidly each week from the barrels of the true og's loaded guns. Hear it and be converted the Kevin gill show is here to stay.

The Kevin Gill show is a great podcast. The variety of guests never ceases to amaze me. Kevin's approach to life is very refreshing. The free flowing conversation format of the podcasts really gives me the impression that he and the people he associates with have all checked there ego a long time ago which makes the show that much more enjoyable and fun to support. If you are a fan of music or wrestling check it out!

        The swift kick I may have needed
Take two things that I have drawn motivation and inspiration from throughout my life, Punk Rock and Wrestling and turn them into a radio show; call me a happy individual. I just discovered this show today and already listened to 3 episodes with Punk Rock icons I grew up listening to. If you live in Missouri such as I do, it is hard to have conversations about Punk with most people. From someone who played in a Punk Rock band for years, THIS IS REFRESHING!!! . But the reason I am taking the time to write a review is; the show is undeniably positive and I am very appreciative for that. It inspired me to pick up my bass and play along to our album from a few years ago (which I haven’t done in a long time). Take lessons from where you can get them, even if it’s a little here and there, you could release bitterness or just feel refreshed that there are people out there that share your interest despite how ‘adolesant’ they may seem to others. Thank you for the good vibe,
Dave

        Hey Yo!
This is my favorite podcast and have listened to every show. It's awesome listening to the interviews of the people I know and even learning about the people I don't know. I also love all the positivity of the show. I don't do many reviews of stuff but thought I would do one for KG. Keep that PMA!

        Keeps it movin
This is a great show with a lot of interesting guests. You may not have heard of some of them, but you'll probably end up relating to them in some personal way through these insightful interviews. With every listen, I gain more understanding of other peoples' accomplishments and challenges in life and learn that in the end, we really are similar beings and should keep an open (and POSITIVE) mind in our own journeys. Listen, learn, enjoy and keep that PMA!!

I got into The Kevin Gill Show for the wrestling interviews. Stayed for everything else. Kevin has such a good interview style that I find myself really enjoying guests I've never even heard of or maybe am not so much a fan of.

This show is an absolute joy to listen to on the road, in the confines of work, in your own household! Kevin Gill is a journeyman spreading the power of positivity affecting so many people! Whether you're a Juggalo, a wrestling fan, a blue collar grinder, a music lover or a video game enthusiast, this is the show for you! Kevin Gill is the realest guy and the most humble individual I've ever had the pleasure of listening to his story.

My son had a speeding ticket which normally would have resulted in the loss of his license. Before court - Mr. Causey instructed him to take a safety driving course. This must have been exactly what was needed because he was able to keep his license. The fees Mr. Causey charges are reasonable- more so when compared with what the insurance company would have ended up costing my son!!If you are in need of an attorney that WILL WORK FOR YOU then Mr. Causey is the one you need to retain. There really are not enough words to describe how conscientious and what a professional attorney that he is.Tennant Law Offices PCTeresa K. ratedPete is a great attorney, who listens to his clients and always takes the time to explain everything so we're kept informed.  I'm very pleased with Tennant Law Offices.Kreager Alex Cmiss_reader2006 ratedWhile not a proud subject to talk about, Bankruptcy happens.

The attorneys are great to work with.Tennant Law Offices PCLinda R. ratedGreat Law Firm! Highly Recommend if you need a trusted lawyer!   The Carey Law FirmJordan P. ratedVery professional. Great practice. Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations.
