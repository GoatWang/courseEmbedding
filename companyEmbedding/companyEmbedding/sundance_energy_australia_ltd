As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Sundance Energy Australia Ltd (OTCPK:SDCJF)
Graham Number
=GURUF("OTCPK:SDCJF","Graham Number")

$N/A (As of Mar. 2017)
Graham Number is a figure that measures a stock's fundamental value by taking into account the company's earnings per share and book value per share. The Graham number is the upper bound of the price range that a defensive investor should pay for the stock. According to the theory, any stock price below the Graham number is considered undervalued, and thus worth investing in.
As of today, the stock price of Sundance Energy Australia Ltd is $0.05. Sundance Energy Australia Ltd's graham number for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 was $N/A. Therefore, Sundance Energy Australia Ltd's Price to Graham Number ratio for today is N/A.
Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation. It is a very conservative way of valuing a stock.

Definition
Graham Number is a concept based on Ben Graham's conservative valuation of companies.
Sundance Energy Australia Ltd's Graham Number for the fiscal year that ended in Dec. 2016 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book Value per Share*EPS without Non-Recurring Items (NRI))


=sqrt of (22.5*0.158*-0.052)


=N/A



Sundance Energy Australia Ltd's Graham Number for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book Value per Share*EPS without Non-Recurring Items (NRI) (TTM))


=sqrt of (22.5*0.161*-0.05)


=N/A



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Explanation
Ben Graham actually did not publish a formula like this. But he wrote in The Intelligent Investor (1948 version) regarding to the criteria for purchases:
Current price should not be more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
Current price should not be more than 1.5 times the book value last reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15 times earnings and 1.5 times book value. It would admit an issue selling at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)
Unlike valuation methods such as DCF or Discounted Earnings, the Graham number does not take growth into the valuation. Unlike the valuation methods based on book value alone, it takes into account the earnings power. Therefore, the Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation.
In general, the Graham number is a very conservative way of valuing a stock. It cannot be applied to companies with negative book values. 
Sundance Energy Australia Ltd's Price to Graham number Ratio for today is calculated as



Price to Graham number=Share Price (Today)/Graham number (Q: Mar. 2017 )


=0.05/N/A


=N/A



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Please keep these in mind:
1. Graham Number does not take growth into account. Therefore it underestimates the values of the companies that have good earnings growth. We feel that if the earnings per share grows more than 10% a year, Graham Number underestimates the value.
2. Graham Number punishes the companies that have temporarily low earnings. Therefore, an average of earnings makes more sense in the calculation of Graham Number.
3. Graham Numbers underestimates companies that are light with book.
