 Dynamic-scaling and unlimited trafficPay per use bandwidth and serversGreat for variable and low workload servicesLearn more about public cloud serversFeatures & OptionsDedicated Hardware

Your dedicated infrastructure consists of your choice of our engineered Intel dedicated servers, hosted in our Canadian data centers, and delivered on our fully redundant network. Costs are fixed and recurring, with unmetered bandwidth – great for high-traffic applications. The power of dedicated servers makes them ideal for running power hungry application. And dedicated servers can provide a solid basis for using virtualization to create a private cloud environment.
 Virtualization

You can choose to use virtualization on your dedicated hardware in order to create a private cloud environment. Choose from the most popular Hypervisors to create a layer of virtualization on top of your dedicated architecture, pooling resources and allocating them between services in your virtual data center. Virtualization provides flexibility for your IT team, who can add and remove servers, services and users according to your business needs.
 Public Cloud Services

The iWeb Public Cloud provides additional scalability and elasticity to your hybrid hosting solution, with a variable cost model where you only pay for the servers, storage and bandwidth that you use. Dynamic scaling plus the pay-as-you-use model make the public cloud more cost effective for services with variable or low workloads, and great for handling unexpected workload spikes.
