OConnor Product Excellence Video


Here is a short film that describes our manufacturing process for the mainbody housing of the OConnor 2575 pan and tilt head.
In our products, we use some of the most pacing mechanical manufacturing technologies such as the latest advances MIM, to technologies such as investment casting, developed in ancient Egypt over 5000 years ago!
The mainbody is the main hub around which everything is built. It houses the fluid drag chambers and pan and tilt bearings, as well as, acting as the base for mounting the counterbalance mechanism.
The Video starts with the melting of the magnesium alloy ingots and the construction of the sand moulds from an array of patterns and core boxes. The cope and drag are assembled and the casting poured.
The casting is then extracted, runners and risers are cut off and the casting is fettled and heat treated for strength in preparation for machining.
The castings are then loaded into a high speed Horizontal NC Milling machine to be cut to its final tightly tolerance dimensions, being inspected carefully along the way!
The machined part is then carefully deburred before being sent off for coating, this coating stops the magnesium corroding and also provides a key for the hard epoxy paint.
Once painted the casting is ready for final assembly and testing.
If you want more detail on this or have any questions please go to our ‘Ask OConnor’ section.

Labs

Chadwell O’Connor developed the Fluid Head pan and tilt system in the late 1940s while trying to solve the problem of panning smoothly while he pursued his passion of filming steam locomotives. His invention only became a marketed product when Walt Disney himself saw Chad O’Connor using that Fluid Head, and placed an order for 10 of them. OConnor Engineering Laboratories was born.
Today, OConnor specializes in fluid heads, tripods and camera accessories, and though the founder has passed on, OConnor employees all over the world continue to observe the art and craft of cinematography, in order to invent, innovate and improve products to further the art and help ease the craft. With a nod to Chad and the amazing legacy he left us, we created the Labs - a technical section of our website, designed to share our experiences with you. It will feature tips & tricks on how to use, tweak and fix OConnor products in the field, complete with pictures, videos and short editorial pieces.

Naming Sin: Flannery O’Connor’s Mark on Bruce Springsteen

Naming Sin: Flannery O’Connor’s Mark on Bruce Springsteen
 Dappled ThingsDamian J. Ference
Not so long ago Bruce Springsteen made a surprise visit to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland to take in an exhibit dedicated to his life’s work.1 The exhibit, which took up two entire floors of the museum, was filled with artifacts from Springsteen’s life, including guitars, clothing, hand-written lyrics, and walls of photographs. One of the photographs was of an eight year-old Springsteen, standing with hands folded in front of the high altar at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Freehold, New Jersey—Springsteen’s first communion picture.
Bruce Springsteen’s relationship with the Catholic Church may have reached its peak on his first communion day. He writes, “In the third grade a nun stuffed me in a garbage can under her desk because, she said, that’s where I belonged. I also had the distinction of being the only altar boy knocked down by a priest during Mass.”2 By the time he made his confirmation, the sacrament which is supposed to seal you with the gifts of the Holy Spirit in order to spread the Gospel to all corners of the earth, Springsteen had had enough. In his words, “I quit the stuff (religion) when I was in eighth grade. By the time you’re older than 13 it’s too ludicrous to go along with anymore. By the time I was in eighth grade I just lost it all.”3 But in reality, he didn’t lose it all. He may have stopped going to Mass and formally practicing his faith, but the Catholic worldview he received through his family and the sisters at St. Rose’s never left him. However, it would take another cradle Catholic to help him understand, appreciate and develop his sacramental imagination and his worldview. Enter Flannery O’Connor.
Original Sin as the First Principle
Unlike Flannery O’Connor, who grew up in a Catholic home that encouraged reading from a very early age,4 Springsteen never read much growing up. He notes, “I wasn’t brought up in a house where there was a lot of reading and stuff. I was brought up on TV.”5 It wasn’t until much later in life that he would begin to take books seriously, and O’Connor was one of the authors whose work resonated with him most, specifically her view of human nature and the world.
In an interview with Walker Percy’s nephew, Springsteen explains his initial draw to O’Connor: “The really important reading that I did began in my late twenties, with authors like Flannery O’Connor. There was something in those stories of hers that I felt captured a certain part of the American character that Iwas interested in writing about. They were a big, big revelation.”6 That something about O’Connor’s art that resonated so deeply with Springsteen was twofold. First, O’Connor is a master storyteller. She notes, “A story is a way to say something that can’t be said any other way, and it takes every word in the story to say what the meaning is.”7 This too was Springsteen’s principle, and the principle of every good storyteller: show, don’t tell. Second, O’Connor was able to identify a reality present in the world that spoke directly to Springsteen’s Catholic imagination—she had an uncanny ability of naming sin.
According to O’Connor, without sin, you have no story; or you have a very bad story. She notes:
The serious writer has always taken the flaw in human nature for his starting point, usually the flaw in an otherwise admirable character. Drama usually bases itself on the bedrock of original sin, whether the writer thinks in theological terms or not. The Christian novelist is distinguished from his pagan colleagues by recognizing sin as sin.”8
For O’Connor, the world is fallen, and this fallenness is not the consequence of an accident or the environment, but the direct result of humankind’s deliberate turning away from God; it is the doctrine of Original Sin.9
Original Sin, then, is the backdrop against which O’Connor writes. She believes that humankind is fallen and is in need of a savior, and she offers no apology for such a view. She professes,“I am no disbeliever in spiritual purpose and no vague believer. I see from the standpoint of Christian orthodoxy. This means that for me the meaning of life is centered in our Redemption by Christ and what I see in the world I see in its relation to that.”10 O’Connor’s ability to look out to the world to see and name sin, and the longing of every human heart to be rescued from that curse, would leave an indelible mark on Springsteen as a man and as a storyteller. He explains:
She got to the heart of some part of meanness that she never spelled out, because if she spelled it out you wouldn’t be getting it. It was always at the core of every one of her stories– the way that she’d left that hole there, that hole that’s inside of everybody. There was some dark thing—a component of spirituality—that I sensed in her stories, and that set me off exploring characters of my own. She knew original sin—she knew how to give it the flesh of the story.11
Springsteen recognized a worldview, ubiquitous in O’Connor’s writing, that he deemed not only probable, but true. From his days of studying the Baltimore Catechism at St. Rose’s grade school, he would have been taught that “sin is divided into the sin we inherit called original sin, and the sin we commit ourselves, called actual sin.”12 O’Connor was able to incarnate this doctrine of sin, to make it believable through characters in her stories. She knew that sin was not a definition to be memorized by students in Catholic schools, but that it was an undeniable reality, which is the starting point of understanding the human drama. She notes that “the greatest dramas naturally involve the salvation or loss of the soul. Where there is no belief in the soul, there is very little drama.”13 This, then, is the mark that O’Connor made on Springsteen; she taught him that a good story is always told against the backdrop of original sin, and that without sin, you have no story.
Four Manifestations of the Mark
O’Connor’s influence on Springsteen can be recognized in four particular ways: 1) that a definite change occurred in the themes of Springsteen’s songs and development of his characters as a result of reading O’Connor’s short stories, 2) that Springsteen directly references O’Connor’s work in his style, song lyrics and album titles, 3) that Springsteen holds an unapologetic view of original sin as a ‘first principle’ in his songwriting, and 4) that although Springsteen has personally struggled in his relationship with the Catholic Church, he has not rejected the fundamental doctrines of Christianity, which, according to O’Connor, are essential to good writing.
Springsteen began reading O’Connor’s stories in his late twenties, which was at same the time he was working on Darkness on the Edge of Town, released in 1978. In his review of Darkness in Rolling Stone, Paul Nelson writes, “Many of the characters in the songs on Bruce Springsteen’s new album appear to be trapped in a state of desperation so intense that they must either break through to something better (or at least into something ambiguous) or break down into madness, murder or worse.”14 In the words of O’Connor, “Either one is serious about salvation or one is not.”15 
Springsteen wrote over seventy songs for the Darkness album, and many of those songs appeared on his next album, The River. Of course, one wonders whether Springsteen pulled the album title directly from O’Connor’s story of the same name. It seems a safe bet, especially since he also penned a song during that same period entitled “A Good Man is Hard to Find.”16 
In 1982, Springsteen released Nebraska, which, more than any of his other albums, sounds like O’Connor. Even the reviews that the album received sounded like reviews of O’Connor’s stories: “startling, direct and chilling.”17 Springsteen explains, “At home, just before recording Nebraska, I was reading Flannery O’Connor. Her stories reminded me of the unknowability18 of God and contained a dark spirituality that resonated with my feeling at the time.”19 This theme of God’s unknowability was mistakenly understood by some reviewers as nihilism, especially in reference to the last track on the album, “Reason to Believe,” where in the first verse, a man pokes a dead dog with a stick in an attempt to revive it; in the second verse another man leaves his wife, who waits for him, every day, down at the end of a dirt road; in the third, an old man dies in a whitewashed shotgun shack; and in the final verse, a groom, stood up at his riverside wedding, stands alone and wonders where his bride might be. Like O’Connor, Springsteen is no nihilist, and neither is he naïve. Springsteen recognizes that sin is present in the world, and whether we recognize it or not, it affects all of us. Yet, once recognized, it is ours to determine how we will respond to it.
In the story “A Good Man Is Hard to Find,” the Misfit tells the Grandmother that everyone has a choice to make: for life, which is following Jesus; or for death, which is doing whatever you want—sin. The Misf t says:
He (Jesus) thown everything off balance. If he did what he said he did, then it’s nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow Him, and if He didn’t, then it’s nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can—by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. No pleasure but meanness.20
For O’Connor, meanness is sin. This meanness is precisely the reason that Springsteen gives when explaining why the narrator in the song “Nebraska” killed ten innocent people. He confesses,“They wanted to know why I did what I did, well, sir, I guess there’s just a meanness in this world.”21 Again, this meanness isn’t random, it is a consequence of the Fall, and it is something that every human being must respond to, either by turning away from it or by embracing it.
Although O’Connor’s most direct influence on Springsteen is presented on Nebraska, his songwriting, after reading O’Connor, consistently accounts for the presence of sin—a meanness in thisworld—as a backdrop and a first principle for his narrative. On every one of his albums since Nebraska, Springsteen has continued to tell stories of men and women wrestling with original sin and its consequences, which are manifested in narratives of isolation, infidelity, injustice, robbery, terrorism, murder, and death. Yet as O’Connor notes, “There is something in us, as storytellers and listeners to stories, that demands the redemptive act, that demandsthat what falls at least be offered the chance to be restored.”22 Springsteen, like O’Connor before him, also deals with thethemes of redemption and salvation as a remedy to sin in his writing, but the essential point here is to recognize that there can be no redemption and no salvation without first acknowledging the power, the presence, and the reality of sin as a first principleand starting point.23
But the question remains: Does Springsteen’s worldview, specifically his recognition of sin, make him a Catholic writer, even though he does not practice his Catholic faith, and admits to being the father of three “pagan babies”?24 It is a difficult question, yet by O’Connor’s description of what a Catholic writer is, it seems that Springsteen meets her standards.
In her essay on the Catholic novelist, “Novelist and Believer,” O’Connor offers her best explanation of what it means to be a Catholic writer. Of course, Bruce Springsteen is a songwriter, not a novelist, but this distinction does not change the substance of her argument. She writes:
[T]he writer whose vocation is fiction sees his obligation as being to the truth of what can happen in life. . . . The Catholic novelist doesn’t have to be a saint; he doesn’t even have to be a Catholic; he does, unfortunately, have to be a novelist. This doesn’t mean that the writer should lack moral vision, but I think that to understand what it does mean, we have to consider for a while what fiction—novel or story—is, and what would give a piece of fiction the right to have the adjective “Catholic” applied to it.25
Within her description O’Connor seems to point to two components that make one a Catholic writer. The first is that the writer sees the world as it is, and the second is that the writer be good at writing. Springsteen undoubtedly meets both requirements.
Bruce Springsteen does see his obligation as a songwriter “as being to the truth of what can happen in life.” He observes,“Writers and artists create little worlds and control them. You do that well enough, you begin to believe you can live in one of them. But the real world doesn’t work that way.”26 In other words, Springsteen doesn’t create a new world for his characters to live in; he actually writes his characters into the fallen world—the real world. This is precisely what O’Connor meant when she described a Catholic novel (or in our case, a Catholic song) as“one that represents reality adequately as we see it manifested in this world of things and human relationships. Only in and by these experiences does the fiction writer approach the contemplative knowledge of the mystery they embody.”27 
Second, Springsteen is a great songwriter, as is witnessed by exceptionally favorable reviews of his records and his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, not to mention his AcademyAwards, Grammy Awards, record sales, concert sales, and faithful fan-base.28 
Meeting both of O’Connor’s requirements as one who sees the world as it is and being a good writer would make it safe to give Springsteen the distinction of “Catholic writer.” And as a matter of fact, Springsteen would not argue with this title, as he himself has explained that there are three reasons he writes the way he does: “Catholic school, Catholic school, Catholic school.”29 Of course, he also admits that O’Connor was the one who helped rekindle those fundamental doctrines of Christianity he learned as a child in order to make them a part of his songwriting, specifically the doctrine of original sin.
The Tradition Continued
Flannery O’Connor served Bruce Springsteen as a bearer of a long tradition of naming sin, which she inherited from reading the Bible, as well as the works of Augustine, Aquinas, Dostoevsky, Joyce, Maritan, Gilson, and Chardin, to name but a few. Through her short stories, O’Connor passed on her worldview to Springsteen, which made a significant mark on his song writing, and which continues to influence the likes of U2, Lucinda Williams, PattyGriffin, Josh Ritter, Arcade Fire, and other contemporary artists who also recognize the fallen world and write good music about it. And although it is true that Springsteen may not be a saint, he continues to be a great Catholic songwriter. He proudly professes that Flannery O’Connor left her mark on him: the ability to name sin—a priceless gift to any postmodern writer.

18     The unknowability of God is a major theme not only in O’Connor’s writing, but in Catholic theology as a whole. Thomas Aquinas, O’Connor’s favorite theologian, taught her that God is infinitely other and cannot be known as he is through our natural powers (Summa Theologica, I, 12, 4). However, just because God cannot be known as one might know some material thing or even a formal geometrical proof does not mean God does not exist. It simply means that God exists in a different way, as the sheer act of being, and that God’s ways are not our ways.

Very insightful article. As a long-time fan of Springsteen and admirer of O’Connor, I agree with your assessment of O’Connor’s influence on Bruce’s work. It would be wonderful if Springsteen continued to push himself to write songs of the same caliber as those on his earlier albums. O’Connor never lowered her standards, but Springsteen seems to be resting on his laurels with his last few offerings. Maybe he’s no longer capable of being great, but this article reminds me that he once was.

Interesting article, thank you so much! I started reading O’Connor because of the Percy interview.
This might interest you as well, especially this week:

I was never a fan of Springsteen, though many of my friends growing up in the Youngstown, OH area loved him for identifying with the blue-collar, steel-town types.  In later years, I grew to dislike him even more for his politics.  Now, living in Cleveland, I would see the billboards for the Rock Hall exhibition and think, “Not if you paid me to go.”
However, I adore Flannery O’Connor, and I have to say, all political and musical tastes aside, this article gives me a greater appreciation for him as an artist and a writer. That quote from A Good Man is Hard to Find contain some of the best words ever written.  And The River?  Oh–what words can you use to describe that story?  
Springsteen loves Flannery?  OK, I will no longer grimace when I hear his music, and I might even listen for a minute to see if I can detect a bit of Southern Catholicism seeping through.

listen to the song “Land of Hope and Dreams” or anything on the new “Wrecking Ball” (except that song) and you’ll get an appreciation for an artist who is NOT “resting on his laurels.” I can’t think of another classic rock artist who has stayed relevant for 40 plus years. Bruce is a great writer and a an even greater performer. This article was really wonderful to read and I even found out about Flannery O’Connor which I knew nothing of. Thanks!

On set with Bruce Melhuish
Cinematographer for "Welcome to Curiosity"



I always work with OConnor heads and I’m a big fan of the 2065; it’s lightweight and has such great balance and reliable movement that it really has become an extension of my arm, I always know what I’m going to be able to do with it.

Project Overview
Welcome to Curiosity is a low-budget independent feature from Jericho Lane Pictures, directed by Ben Pickering from a script by Darren Ripley. The film was shot on location in Cornwall, a stunning county where you are never more than an hour from rural farmland, rugged coastline, golden sandy beaches or barren moorland.
Welcome to Curiosity tells five stories that overlap at various points.  A heist followed by betrayal, a serial killer being hunted by a young boy, an escapee from a psychiatric hospital, a girl stepping out with a bad man and a salesman seeing things.
Behind the production
Planning the production for Welcome to Curiosity it was clear that we were going to have to work very fast, with a small crew and really push hard to maximize our time at each location.
We had a fantastic camera package from Filmscape in London, with a RED Epic and Cooke S4i lenses.  I love the mobility of the Epic and its low light sensitivity; I kept the camera rated at 800ASA throughout production.
Shooting to such a tight schedule we would often have two unit moves in a single day and I wanted a camera package that could move quickly between locations.  Knowing that I’d be filming in small, remote properties, I also wanted a lighting package that wouldn’t throw out too much heat and could run from mains power and, where necessary, a small portable generator.
One of my favourite locations was a beautiful 19th century farmhouse that features quite heavily in the story.  Being an old building it is very small and dark but looks absolutely amazing on camera, full of texture and the kind of character that only 150 years of being lived in can give.
With this in mind I opted for a set of LED Inca Fresnel lights from Litepanels. They have such a clean quality of light output that they seamlessly blend with the practical lighting that I like to use.  All in a package that draws such little power and generates almost no heat.
How Vitec kit supported the production
I always work with OConnor heads and I’m a big fan of the 2065; it’s lightweight and has such great balance and reliable movement that it really has become an extension of my arm, I always know what I’m going to be able to do with it.
The Litepanels LED Fresnels and 1x1s combined with Anton/Bauer batteries really gave me a lot of versatility and the ability to move quickly between setups and locations.
In one big night exterior we were quite far from the house but I wanted the interior lights to carry, so I placed three Inca 12s in the rooms, pushing out around 2K of light from each unit and only drawing around 350W.  I was able to power them from the house and leave the lamps in very small rooms with no fear of fire.
We also had a lot of night car interior shots and I turned to the Croma Kit from Litepanels; a beautifully packaged lamp that can be set almost anywhere.  It’s completely dimmable and the colour temperature can be dialled from daylight to tungsten.  I opted for somewhere in between at around 4000k and got some stunning results.  The Croma lamps have incredible run time from AA batteries.

BIOGRAPHYBruce Melhuish is an award-winning director of photography with several years of experience working in film, music videos and commercials. In 2011 Bruce shot the critically acclaimed feature The Glass Man starring Andy Nyman, James Cosmo and Neve Campbell. Kermode and Mayo' Film Review on BBC Radio One praised his cinematography for its "Hitchcockian Style".
In 2013 Bruce completed the feature comedy Art Ache, several shorts, commercial spots for companies such as Marks and Spencer, and music videos for artists, including Emilia Mitiku, Wookie and Eliza Doolittle.
Bruce is also a producer in his own right, having co-produced The Glass Man, and is currently in development on a slate of films with producing partner Cristian Solimeno. Bruce is set to make his directorial debut towards the end of 2014 with the feature film Forgiveness.
Originally from Torquay in Devon, Bruce moved to London to study at university before working in the technology sector for companies such as Arius 3D (a part of IMAX). In 2010 he made the switch to cinematography full time and hasn't looked back. Bruce has two Rhodesian Ridgebacks named Walter and Norah and is a keen horse rider and lover of all things outdoors.

Ivo Nörenberg
"OConnor is one of those brands that you don’t need to think twice about. I chose to use the 2560 because it literally offered me everything I expect of my camera equipment when traveling: lightweight, durable, and most of all, flawless performance in the harshest environments and at the most critical moments."

Alex Buono
"OConnor does a good job of identifying what actually is going to work in the field and what we need and don't need. I've used a lot of different fluid heads, but OConnor is just so far above and beyond the performance of every other fluid head in the market."

Richard Blanshard
"In our industry, we know that OConnor is the industry standard. There were three cameras for The Man who Knew Infinity and we were all on OConnor and that says everything. It delivers what you want – plain and simple. Whatever you want to achieve, OConnor enables you to do it. You just can’t beat that amount of flexibility."

Everything That Rises - Bruce Springsteen: The Ghost of Flannery O'Connor
Tweets by @ETR_GUComments or questions about this blog? Send an email message to everythingthatrises@georgetown.eduby Paul Eliefrom Georgetown UniversityBruce Springsteen: The Ghost of Flannery O'ConnorA few years ago Rolling Stone ran the above photograph of “Bruce’s Retreat” – the room in his house in Rumsen, New Jersey, where he reads and writes.  As printed in the magazine, the photograph was just enough of a close-up that you could make out a few of the books.  I know this because a friend told me that he was sure he could see my first book there on the Boss’s shelf.  Reader, I used a magnifying glass … but no, the book wasn’t mine, dammit, it was another book with a black-and-gold spine.Now we have Springsteen’s current reading tastes from a more reliable authority: his own.  For those of us who have kept up with his catholically canonical favorite books, there are no great surprises in the Times’s brief “By the Book” e-interview, not even the fact that he wrote “The Ghost of Tom Joad” before reading The Grapes of Wrath – no surprises, that is, except for the stress that he still puts on Flannery O'Connor’s influence more than a third of a century after his first encounter with her.That was when, at age 28, he started reading seriously for the first time: O'Connor, James M. Cain, John Cheever, Sherwood Anderson, and Jim Thompson.These authors contributed greatly to the turn my music took around 1978-82. They brought out a sense of geography and the dark strain in my writing, broadened my horizons about what might be accomplished with a pop song and are still the cornerstone literally for what I try to accomplish today.These authors – but O'Connor in particular. Asked which one book – which one author – made him who he is, he explains:One would be difficult, but the short stories of Flannery O’Connor landed hard on me. You could feel within them the unknowability of God, the intangible mysteries of life that confounded her characters, and which I find by my side every day. They contained the dark Gothicness of my childhood and yet made me feel fortunate to sit at the center of this swirling black puzzle, stars reeling overhead, the earth barely beneath us.Little-known fact: In the last months of his life Walker Percy, prompted by his nephew Will, wrote what he called a “fan letter of sorts” to Springsteen – whom he called “one of the few sane guys in your field.”  He asked the Boss about “your spiritual journey,” and in particular about “your admiration for Flannery O'Connor. She was a dear friend of mine,” he told Springsteen, “though a more heroic Catholic than I.”In a 1997 interview in DoubleTake (it figures into The Life You Save May Be Your Own) Springsteen told the nephew what O'Connor meant to him in the voice familiar from his long on-mike introductions to songs like “The Promised Land”:There was something in those stories of hers that I felt captured a certain part of the American character that I was interested in writing about. They were a big, big revelation … There was some dark thing – a component of spirituality – that I sensed in her stories, and that sent me off exploring on my own.And me on mine.  And you on yours – as with Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, which Springsteen likes to read on a summer’s day on the front porch.   2 November 2014#literature and belief#flannery o'connor#bruce springsteen#walker percy9plconnelly reblogged this from etr-gu thedrinkingsloth liked this                                    theorajones liked this                                    steffistrange liked this                                    daninj419 liked this                                    churchofpoetry reblogged this from dianebluegreen and added:
