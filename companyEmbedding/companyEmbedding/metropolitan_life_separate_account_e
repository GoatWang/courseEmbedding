 PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown.  Investment return and principal value fluctuate with changing market conditions so that, when redeemed, units may be worth more or less than their original cost. Returns reflect the percentage change in unit value for the period indicated, after the deduction of all fees and expenses of the underlying portfolio, as well as the charges deducted from the separate account, including the mortality and expense risk subaccount administrative charge, the contract administrative charge, and deferred sales charge (5% maximum). All performance figures are annualized unless otherwise noted.  FEE WAIVER:  Returns may reflect past or present fee waivers, limits or reductions negotiated by the portfolio's investment manager.  Without such waivers, limits or reductions the returns would be lower.  Please see the product disclosure memorandum for complete details.TO OBTAIN A DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUM, TALK TO YOUR FINANCIAL REPRESENTATIVE OR WRITE TO THE INSURANCECOMPANY LISTED BELOW. WE ADVISE YOU TOCAREFULLYCONSIDER THE PRODUCT AND FUNDS OBJECTIVES, RISKS,CHARGES AND EXPENSES BEFORE INVESTING. THE DISCLOSURE MEMORANDUMCONTAIN THIS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND FUNDS. PLEASE READ THE MEMORANDUMCAREFULLY BEFORE YOU INVEST.  
              
 NOTE: Funds may not be available in all jurisdictions. Investments in variable products involve risk including possible loss of principal. Some portfolios include more risk than others, such as REIT investments that can be affected by interest rate moves, economic cycles and tax and regulatory requirements. Furthermore, there are additional risks associated with investing in non-US companies, high-yield bonds, emerging markets, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small-, mid- and micro-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the fund prospectuses. AN INVESTMENT IN THE MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO IS NOT INSURED OR GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY. ALTHOUGH THE PORTFOLIO SEEKS TO PRESERVE THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT AT $1.00 PER UNIT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN THE PORTFOLIO. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the portfolio than the current return quotation. Withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to surrender charges. Amounts withdrawn may be subject to ordinary income tax, and if taken prior to age 59 1/2, a 10% IRS penalty tax may also apply. Withdrawals have the effect of reducing the death benefit, any living benefits and cash value. Gold Track Select is a variable annuity that is issued by the Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC  11225. Brighthouse Securities, LLC is the principal underwriter.

                                                        [Enlarge/Download Table]

                                                                                        
Senior Vice-President Theodossios Athanassiades reported on the proposed     Combination
introduction of a combination annuity product which, together with expanded  Annuity    
channels for its distribution, should help better penetrate various          Product    
tax-qualified markets. Mr. Athanassiades said that some of the components               
of this annuity product will be funds which must be registered with the                 
Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, need Board approval.                 

Mr. Athanassiades said that the tax-qualified markets at which the new                  
product is aimed include teachers, self-employed individuals (Keogh Plans),             
small-size corporate plans and public employees deferred compensation, and              
that these markets currently account for about $15 to $20 billion of new                
money annually. He said that the markets are expected to grow at a fast                 
pace because of both demographic trends and expected governmental programs              
to encourage savings. He noted that all other financial intermediaries are              
active in these markets. Mr. Athanassiades stated that the flexibility of               
the new product is the key to its success and described the four investment             
choices which will be offered, as well as the provisions which will allow               
contractholders to allocate and transfer assets among the different funds.              
He said that the product will be distributed by Metropolitan's regular                  
Pensions field force, as well as by a network of casualty and securities

Combination  brokers. He then reviewed the financial projections for the product which    
Annuity      had been provided to the Directors and said that early financial results     
Product      will be monitored very closely.                                              
(contd.)                                                                                  
             In response to questions from the Directors, the Chairman of the Board       
             described various aspects of the product. The President noted that its       
             distribution through a network of brokers was an important new venture for   
             Metropolitan and added that alternate distribution systems for other         
             Metropolitan products were also being looked at. He said that reports to     
             the Board on these other efforts would be made in due course.

The information shown in the table above was provided by the Portfolios and we  
have not independently verified that information. Net Total Annual Operating    
Expenses shown in the table reflect any current fee waiver or expense           
reimbursement arrangement that will remain in effect for a period of at least   
one year from the date of the Portfolio's 2016 prospectus. "0.00%" in the Fee   
Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement column indicates that there is such an      
arrangement in effect for the Portfolio, but that the expenses of the Portfolio 
are below the level that would trigger the waiver or reimbursement. Fee waiver  
and expense reimbursement arrangements with a duration of less than one year,   
or arrangements that may be terminated without the consent of the Portfolio's   
board of directors or trustees, are not shown.                                  

Certain Portfolios that have "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses" are "funds of    
funds." A fund of funds invests substantially all of its assets in other        
underlying funds. Because the Portfolio invests in other funds, it will bear    
its pro rata portion of the operating expenses of those underlying funds,       
including the management fee.

SSGA Growth and Income ETF Portfolio                                            

"Fund of funds" Portfolios invest substantially all of their assets in other    
portfolios or, with respect to the SSGA Growth ETF Portfolio and the SSGA       
Growth and Income ETF Portfolio, other exchange-traded funds ("Underlying       
ETFs"). Therefore each of these Portfolios will bear its pro rata share of the  
fees and expenses incurred by the underlying portfolios or Underlying ETFs in   
which it invests in addition to its own management fees and expenses. This will 
reduce the investment return of each of the fund of funds Portfolios. The       
expense levels will vary over time, depending on the mix of underlying          
portfolios or Underlying ETFs in which the fund of funds Portfolio invests. You 
may be able to realize lower aggregate expenses by investing directly in the    
underlying portfolios and Underlying ETFs instead of investing in the fund of   
funds Portfolios, if such underlying portfolios or Underlying ETFs are          
available under the Contract. However, no Underlying ETFs and only some of the  
underlying portfolios are available under the Contract.                         

4. Each Portfolio has different investment objectives and risks. The Portfolio  
prospectuses contain more detailed information on each Portfolio's        
investment strategy, investment advisers and its fees. You may obtain a   
Portfolio prospectus by calling 866-438-6477 or through your registered   
   representative. We do not guarantee the investment results of the Portfolios.

The current Portfolios are listed below, along with their investment      
managers and any sub-investment managers.

 PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown.  Investment return and principal value fluctuate with changing market conditions so that, when redeemed, units may be worth more or less than their original cost. Returns reflect the percentage change in unit value for the period indicated, after the deduction of all fees and expenses of the underlying portfolio, as well as the charges deducted from the separate account, including the mortality and expense risk subaccount administrative charge, the contract administrative charge, and deferred sales charge (5% maximum). All performance figures are annualized unless otherwise noted.  FEE WAIVER:  Returns may reflect past or present fee waivers, limits or reductions negotiated by the portfolio's investment manager.  Without such waivers, limits or reductions the returns would be lower.  Please see the product disclosure memorandum for complete details.TO OBTAIN A PROSPECTUS, TALK TO YOUR FINANCIAL REPRESENTATIVE OR WRITE TO THE INSURANCECOMPANY LISTED BELOW.  WE ADVISE YOU TOCAREFULLYCONSIDER THE PRODUCT AND FUNDS' OBJECTIVES, RISKS,CHARGES AND EXPENSES BEFORE INVESTING. THE PROSPECTUSESCONTAIN THIS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND FUNDS.  PLEASE READ THE PROSPECTUSCAREFULLY BEFORE YOU INVEST. 
              
 NOTE: Funds may not be available in all jurisdictions. Investments in variable products involve risk including possible loss of principal. Some portfolios include more risk than others, such as REIT investments that can be affected by interest rate moves, economic cycles and tax and regulatory requirements. Furthermore, there are additional risks associated with investing in non-US companies, high-yield bonds, emerging markets, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small-, mid- and micro-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the fund prospectuses. AN INVESTMENT IN THE MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO IS NOT INSURED OR GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY. ALTHOUGH THE PORTFOLIO SEEKS TO PRESERVE THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT AT $1.00 PER UNIT, IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN THE PORTFOLIO. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the portfolio than the current return quotation. Withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to surrender charges.
