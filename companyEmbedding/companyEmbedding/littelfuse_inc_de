Industrial Fuse Selection and Definitions


Automotive Fuse Link Definition and Specifications
Automotive use links are self-acting break appliances for the protection of electrical devices against unsuitable current loads. The current flow is interrupted by the melting of the fuse wire in which the current flows.
The following international regulations and recommendations in their currently valid version are valid for fuse links:

DIN 72581
DIN 43560
ISO 8820
UL 275
SAE

(Further the level of technology, the details of the actually valid implementation provisions, the safety-principle "human beings, animals and material assets must be protected against danger," as well as the qualification of the installed components should be taken into account - self-responsibility of the manufacturer of electrical devices.)
Selection Explanations and Recommendations
The rated voltage (UN) of a fuse link has to be at least equal or higher than the operating voltage of the device or assembly unit which is to be protected with the fuse link. If the operating voltage is very low, the fuse link's natural resistance (voltage drop) must possibly be taken into consideration.
The voltage drop (UN) is measured according to standards e.g. DIN, ISO, JASO, partially maximum values common for Littelfuse are stated as well.
The rated current (Irat) of a fuse link should approximately correspond to the operating current of the device or assembly unit which is to be protected (in accordance with the ambient temperature and rated current-definition, which means the permitted continuous currents).
Higher ambient temperatures (Tumg) mean additional load for the fuse links. The heating conditions of the maximum occurring ambient temperature have to be checked, in particular with high rated currents of the fuses, and a strong thermal radiation of components nearby. For such applications, the fuse should be derated in accordance with the following diagram, resp. table (see factor FT):
Due to different specifications of rated current the recommended continuous current of the fuse links is max. 80% of their rated current (with an ambient temperature of 23°C), see also the fuse-specific current-carrying capacity (F) on the individual pages of the catalog.
The pre-arcing time limits indicate the relation of fusing time to current. (They are presented as an envelope curve for all mentioned rated currents.)
The melting integral (I2t) results from the squared melting current and the corresponding melting time. At excess current with melting times < 5 ms the melting integral remains constant. The data in this catalog are based on 6 or 10 x lrat. The melting integral is an index for the time-current characteristic and informs about the pulse consistency of a fuse link. The mentioned melting integrals are typical values.
The breaking capacity (IB) should be sufficient for any operating and error conditions. The short-circuit current (maximum fault current) to be interrupted by the fuse links at the rated voltage under default conditions must not be higher than the current corresponding to the breaking capacity of the fuse link.
The maximum power dissipation (PV) is determined at a load with rated current, after having obtained temperature equilibrum. In operation, these values can occur for some time.
Typical values are indicated and in addition the standard values for fuses that comply with standards.
Automotive Fuse Link Selection
With regard to the product-safety of the device and the life/reliability of the fuse links, a correct choice is important. Only when choosing correctly and when using as agreed (that means corresponding to the level of technology and the valid recommendations, as well as the specified characteristics shown in the data sheets) under consideration of the safety-principle (that is to say "human beings, animals and intrinsic values must be protected against danger") can a definite function of the fuse links as a protection component (rated breakpoint) be possible. The personal responsibility of manufacturers of electrical devices is applicable here:
"Any person involved in the production of electrical systems or the manufacturing of electrical equipment, included those dealing with the operation of such systems or equipment is, according to the present interpretation of the law individually responsible for every aspect of compliance to the recognized rules and procedures of electrical engineering."

The necessary voltage rating of a fuse link is established by its required operating voltage (taking into consideration the voltage drop of the fuse link).
The current rating of a fuse link (IN Fuse) is established by the max. effective current load (Ioperating max) taking into consideration the ambient temperature (Factor FT) and the varying rated current definitions ("constant current" definition) (see Faktor FI). The following applies: IN Fuse3 Ioperating max. x FI x FT
t-value  (current-time-integral).2In case of  pulse loading and for semiconductor protection a  suitable current rating can also be ascertained with the  help of the I
The above  mentioned two points will help you to ascertain the most  suitable current rating of a fuse link and its  pre-arcing time limits (if necessary verify  experimentally).
The necessary breaking capacity of the fuse link is determined by the max. possible fault current which can occur.
In addition to the above-mentioned points, the method of installation is also important for correct fuse link selection (taking into consideration possible approvals).

With regard to specific conditions of any particular application (product-safety) it is generally necessary to check the fuse link and/or the thermal circuit breaker or holder in the device which is to be protected under normal and fault conditions!

Littelfuse Fuse Packaging and Part Numbering Systems


Definitions and Terms
Ambient Temperature:
Refers to the temperature of the air immediately surrounding the fuse and is not to be confused with “room temperature.” The fuse ambient temperature is appreciably higher in many cases, because it is enclosed (as in a panel mount fuseholder) or mounted near other heat producing components, such as resistors, transformers, etc.
Breaking Capacity:
Also known as interrupting rating or short circuit rating, this is the maximum approved current which the fuse can safely break at rated voltage. Please refer to the interrupting rating definition of this section for additional information.
Current Rating:
The nominal amperage value of the fuse. It is established by the manufacturer as a value of current which the fuse can carry, based on a controlled set of test conditions (See RERATING).
Catalog Fuse part numbers include series identification and amperage ratings. Refer to the FUSE SELECTION GUIDE section for guidance on making the proper choice.
Rerating:
For 25ºC ambient temperatures, it is recommended that fuses be operated at no more than 75% of the nominal current rating established using the controlled test conditions. These test conditions are part of UL/CSA/ANCE (Mexico) 248-14 “Fuses for Supplementary Overcurrent Protection,” whose primary objective is to specify common test standards necessary for the continued control of manufactured items intended for protection against fire, etc. Some common variations of these standards include: fully enclosed fuseholders, high contact resistances, air movement, transient spikes, and changes in connecting cablesize (diameter and length). Fuses are essentially temperature-sensitive devices. Even small variations from the controlled test conditions can greatly affect the predicted life of a fuse when it is loaded to its nominal value, usually expressed as 100% of rating.
The circuit design engineer should clearly understand that the purpose of these controlled test conditions is to enable fuse manufacturers to maintain unified performance standards for their products, and he must account for the variable conditions of his application. To compensate for these variables, the circuit design engineer who is designing for trouble-free, long-life fuse protection in his equipment generally loads his fuse not more than 75% of the nominal rating listed by the manufacturer,keeping in mind that overload and short circuit protection must be adequately provided for.
The fuses under discussion are temperature-sensitive devices whose ratings have been established in a 25ºC ambient. The fuse temperature generated by the current passing through the fuse increases or decreases with ambient temperature change.
The ambient temperature chart in the FUSE SELECTION GUIDE section illustrates the effect that ambient temperature has on the nominal current rating of a fuse. Most traditional Slo-Blo® Fuse designs use lower melting temperature materials and are, therefore, more sensitive to ambient temperature changes.
Dimensions:
Unless otherwise specified, dimensions are in inches.
The fuses in this catalog range in size from the approx. 0402 chip size (.041”L x .020”W x .012”H) up to the 5 AG, also commonly known as a”MIDGET” fuse (13/32” Dia. x 11/2” Length). As new products were developed throughout the years, fuse sizes evolved to fill the various electrical circuit protection needs.
The first fuses were simple, open-wire devices, followed in the 1890’s by Edison’s enclosure of thin wire in a lamp base to make the first plug fuse. By 1904, Underwriters Laboratories had established size and rating specifications to meet safety standards. The renewable type fuses and automotive fuses appeared in 1914, and in 1927 Littelfuse started making very low amperage fuses for the budding electronics industry.
The fuse sizes in following chart began with the early “Automobile Glass” fuses, thus the term “AG”. The numbers were applied chronologically as different manufacturers started making a new size: “3AG,” for example, was the third size placed on the market. Other non-glass fuse sizes and constructions were determined by functional requirements, but they still retained the length or diameter dimensions of the glass fuses. Their designation was modified to AB in place of AG, indicating that the outer tube was constructed from Bakelite, fibre, ceramic, or a similar material other than glass. The largest size fuse shown in the chart is the 5AG, or “MIDGET,” a name adopted from its use by the electrical industry and the National Electrical Code range which normally recognizes fuses of 9/16” x 2” as the smallest standard fuse in use.


Industrial Fuses and How They Work
View the Littelfuse POWR-GARD Catalog for Complete Fuse Selection Information
An important part of developing quality overcurrent protection is an understanding of system needs and overcurrent protective device fundamentals. This section discusses these topics with special attention to the application of fuses. If you have additional questions, call our Technical Support and Engineering Services Group at 1-800-TEC-FUSE (1-800-832-3873).
Why Overcurrent Protection?
All electrical systems eventually experience overcurrents. Unless removed in time, even moderate overcurrents quickly overheat system components, damaging insulation, conductors, and equipment. Large overcurrents may melt conductors and vaporize insulation. Very high currents produce magnetic forces that bend and twist bus bars. These high currents can pull cables from their terminals and crack insulators and spacers.
Too frequently, fires, explosions, poisonous fumes and panic accompany uncontrolled overcurrents. This not only damages electrical systems and equipment, but may cause injury or death to personnel nearby.
To reduce these hazards, the National Electrical Code® (NEC®), OSHA regulations, and other applicable design and installation standards require overcurrent protection that will disconnect overloaded or faulted equipment.
Industry and governmental organizations have developed performance standards for overcurrent devices and testing procedures that show compliance with the standards and with the NEC. These organizations include: the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), all of which work in conjunction with Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTL) such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL).
Electrical systems must meet applicable code requirements including those for overcurrent protection before electric utilities are allowed to provide electric power to a facility.
What is Quality Overcurrent Protection?
A system with quality overcurrent protection has the following characteristics:

Meets all legal requirements, such as NEC, OSHA, local codes, etc.
Provides maximum safety for personnel, exceeding minimum code requirements as necessary.
Minimizes overcurrent damage to property, equipment, and electrical systems.
Provides coordinated protection. Only the protective device immediately on the line side of an overcurrent opens to protect the system and minimize unnecessary downtime.
Is cost effective while providing reserve interrupting capacity for future growth. 
Consists of equipment and components not subject to obsolescence and requiring only minimum maintenance that can be performed by regular maintenance personnel using readily available tools and equipment.

Overcurrent Types and Effects
An overcurrent is any current that exceeds the ampere rating of conductors, equipment, or devices under conditions of use. The term "overcurrent" includes both overloads and short-circuits.
Overloads
An overload is an overcurrent confined to normal current paths in which there is no insulation breakdown.
Sustained overloads are commonly caused by installing excessive equipment such as additional lighting fixtures or too many motors. Sustained overloads are also caused by overloading mechanical equipment and by equipment breakdown such as failed bearings. If not disconnected within established time limits, sustained overloads eventually overheat circuit components causing thermal damage to insulation and other system components.
Overcurrent protective devices must disconnect circuits and equipment experiencing continuous or sustained overloads before overheating occurs. Even moderate insulation overheating can seriously reduce the life of the components and/or equipment involved. For example, motors overloaded by just 15% may experience less than 50% of normal insulation life.
Temporary overloads occur frequently. Common causes include temporary equipment overloads such as a machine tool taking too deep of a cut, or simply the starting of an inductive load such as a motor. Since temporary overloads are by definition harmless, overcurrent protective devices should not open or clear the circuit.
It is important to realize that fuses selected must have sufficient time-delay to allow motors to start and temporary overloads to subside. However, should the overcurrent continue, fuses must then open before system components are damaged. Littelfuse POWR-PRO® and POWR-GARD® time-delay fuses are designed to meet these types of protective needs. In general, time-delay fuses hold 500% of the rated current for a minimum of ten seconds, yet will still open quickly on higher values of current.
Even though government-mandated high-efficiency motors and NEMA Design E motors have much higher locked rotor currents, POWR-PRO® time-delay fuses such as the FLSR_ID, LLSRK_ID, or IDSR series have sufficient time-delay to permit motors to start when the fuses are properly selected in accordance with the NEC®.
Short-Circuits
A short-circuit is an overcurrent flowing outside of its normal path. Types of short-circuits are generally divided into three categories: bolted faults, arcing faults, and ground faults. Each type of short-circuit is defined in the Terms and Definitions section.
A short-circuit is caused by an insulation breakdown or faulty connection. During a circuit's normal operation, the connected load determines current. When a short-circuit occurs, the current bypasses the normal load and takes a "shorter path," hence the term ‘short-circuit'. Since there is no load impedance, the only factor limiting current flow is the total distribution system's impedance from the utility's generators to the point of fault.
A typical electrical system might have a normal load impedance of 10 ohms. But in a single-phase situation, the same system might have a load impedance of 0.005 ohms or less. In order to compare the two scenarios, it is best to apply Ohm's Law (I = E/R for AC systems). A 480 volt single-phase circuit with the 10 ohm load impedance would draw 48 amperes (480/10 = 48). If the same circuit has a 0.005 ohm system impedance when the load is shorted, the available fault current would increase significantly to 96,000 amperes (480/0.005 = 96,000).
As stated, short-circuits are currents that flow outside of their normal path. Regardless of the magnitude of overcurrent, the excessive current must be removed quickly. If not removed promptly, the large currents associated with short-circuits may have three profound effects on an electrical system: heating, magnetic stress, and arcing.
Heating occurs in every part of an electrical system when current passes through the system. When overcurrents are large enough, heating is practically instantaneous. The energy in such overcurrents is measured in ampere-squared seconds (I2t). An overcurrent of 10,000 amperes that lasts for 0.01 seconds has an I2t of 1,000,000 A2s. If the current could be reduced from 10,000 amperes to 1,000 amperes for the same period of time, the corresponding I2t would be reduced to 10,000 A2s, or just one percent of the original value.
If the current in a conductor increases 10 times, the I2t increases 100 times. A current of only 7,500 amperes can melt a #8 AWG copper wire in 0.1 second. Within eight milliseconds (0.008 seconds or one-half cycle), a current of 6,500 amperes can raise the temperature of #12 AWG THHN thermoplastic insulated copper wire from its operating temperature of 75°C to its maximum short-circuit temperature of 150°C. Any currents larger than this may immediately vaporize organic insulations. Arcs at the point of fault or from mechanical switching such as automatic transfer switches or circuit breakers may ignite the vapors causing violent explosions and electrical flash.
Magnetic stress (or force) is a function of the peak current squared. Fault currents of 100,000 amperes can exert forces of more than 7,000 lb. per foot of bus bar. Stresses of this magnitude may damage insulation, pull conductors from terminals, and stress equipment terminals sufficiently such that significant damage occurs.
Arcing at the point of fault melts and vaporizes all of the conductors and components involved in the fault. The arcs often burn through raceways and equipment enclosures, showering the area with molten metal that quickly starts fires and/or injures any personnel in the area. Additional short-circuits are often created when vaporized material is deposited on insulators and other surfaces. Sustained arcing-faults vaporize organic insulation, and the vapors may explode or burn.
Whether the effects are heating, magnetic stress, and/or arcing, the potential damage to electrical systems can be significant as a result of short-circuits occurring.
II. Selection Considerations
Selection Considerations for Fuses (600 volts and below)
Since overcurrent protection is crucial to reliable electrical system operation and safety, overcurrent device selection and application should be carefully considered. When selecting fuses, the following parameters or considerations need to be evaluated:

Current Rating

General Industrial Fusing Recommendations
Based on the above selection considerations, the following is recommended:
Fuses with ampere ratings from 1/10 through 600 amperes

When available fault currents are less than 100,000 amperes and when equipment does not require the more current-limiting characteristics of UL Class RK1 fuses, FLNR and FLSR_ID Series Class RK5 current-limiting fuses provide superior time-delay and cycling characteristics at a lower cost than RK1 fuses. If available fault currents exceed 100,000 amperes, equipment may need the additional current-limitation capabilities of the LLNRK, LLSRK and LLSRK_ID series Class RK1 fuses.
Fast-acting JLLN and JLLS series Class T fuses possess space-saving features that make them especially suitable for protection of molded case circuit breakers, meter banks, and similar limited-space applications. 
Time-delay JTD_ID and JTD series Class J fuses are used in OEM motor control center applications as well as other MRO motor and transformer applications requiring space-saving IEC Type 2 protection. 
Class CC and Class CD series fuses are used in control circuits and control panels where space is at a premium. The Littelfuse POWR-PRO CCMR series fuses are best used for protection of small motors, while the Littelfuse KLDR series fuses provide optimal protection for control power transformers and similar devices.

For questions about product applications, call our Technical Support Group at 800-TEC-FUSE.
Fuses with ampere ratings from 601 through 6,000 amperes
For superior protection of most general-purpose and motor circuits, it is recommended to use the POWR-PRO® KLPC series Class L fuses. The Class L fuses are the only time-delay fuse series available in these higher ampere ratings.
Information on all the Littelfuse fuse series referenced above can be found on the UL/CSA Fuse Classes and Applications Charts found in the Technical Application Guide at the end of the POWR-GARD products catalog.
Industrial Circuit Protection Checklist
To select the proper overcurrent protective device for an electrical system, circuit and system designers should ask themselves the following questions before a system is designed:

What is the normal or average current expected?
What is the maximum continuous (three hours or more) current expected?
What inrush or temporary surge currents can be expected?
Are the overcurrent protective devices able to distinguish between expected inrush and surge currents, and open under sustained overloads and fault conditions?
What kind of environmental extremes are possible? Dust, humidity, temperature extremes and other factors need to be considered.
What is the maximum available fault current the protective device may have to interrupt?
Is the overcurrent protective device rated for the system voltage?
Will the overcurrent protective device provide the safest and most reliable protection for the specific equipment?
Under short-circuit conditions, will the overcurrent protective device minimize the possibility of a fire or explosion?
Does the overcurrent protective device meet all the applicable safety standards and installation requirements?

Answers to these questions and other criteria will help to determine the type overcurrent protection device to use for optimum safety, reliability and performance.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Edward V. Sundt founded Littelfuse in 1927 in Chicago Illinois as Littelfuse Laboratories.[4] Prior to founding Littelfuse, Sundt had worked for General Electric and Stewart-Warner, where he found diagnostic equipment frequently experienced electrical failure.[4] Sundt developed Littelfuse’s first product, a small protective fuse, to regulate current in diagnostic equipment and prevent electrical failure.[4] Littelfuse was incorporated and renamed Littelfuse, Inc. in 1938.[4]
Littelfuse became a public company in 1962.[4][5] The company retained founder Edward V. Sundt as the chairman of its board.[5] In 1963, Littelfuse moved its headquarters from Chicago to Des Plaines, Illinois.[4] Sundt retired in 1965 and was succeeded by Thomas Blake.[4] Tracor purchased the company in 1968.[6][4] Blake was made president of Littelfuse, which operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tracor.[7]
1970–1991[edit]
The company expanded its manufacturing base in the 1970s with new factories opening in Watseka, Illinois and Piedras Negras, Mexico.[4] In 1974, the company also introduced Littelites, electronic indicator lights used in industrial and office machinery, household appliances and computers.[4]
In 1976, Littelfuse developed Autofuse, which was the first blade-type fuse used in automobiles.[4] The Autofuse brand was counterfeited heavily and in 1983 the company obtained an exclusionary order from the United States International Trade Commission, which barred the importation of counterfeit blade-type fuses.[8]
In 1987, Westmark Systems purchased Tracor and its Littelfuse subsidiary in leveraged buyout.[9][10] Tracor filed for bankruptcy in 1991 and spun off Littelfuse.[9][11]
Modern history[edit]
Littelfuse reincorporated in November 1991 with Howard Witt as its president and CEO.[12] Witt had worked for Littelfuse since 1979 and had been president and CEO of Littelfuse since February 1990, when the company was still owned by Tracor.[12] In 1991, Littelfuse offered its second IPO in company history.[6] The company’s profits rose throughout the 1990s and the company expanded its operations in Europe and Asia.[4][9] Littelfuse also expanded into South America with a distribution and engineering center in São Paulo, Brazil.[4]
Gordon Hunter replaced Witt as president and CEO of Littelfuse at the end of 2004.[6] In 2008, Littelfuse restructured its manufacturing operations, closing 16 small manufacturing plants and opening 6 new, larger plants.[13] The company moved its headquarters from Des Plaines, Illinois to Chicago, Illinois the same year.[13]
The company was recognized as Product of the Year by Specifying Engineer in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Arrow Electronics recognized Littelfuse with an award for Supplier Excellence in 2011. The company received TTI Supplier's Excellence Award in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Littelfuse received the Chicago Innovation Award in 2012. In 2013, the company received Processing Magazine’s Breakthrough Product of the Year. Littelfuse was recognized as one of the Best Places to Work in Illinois in 2012, 2013 and 2014.[14][15][16][17]
The company announced in November 2016 that COO Dave Heinzmann would succeed Hunter as president and CEO in January 2017.[18]
Products[edit]
Littelfuse designs and manufactures circuit protection products for the electronics, automotive and electrical industries.[2][3] The company operates between three business unit segments: Electronics, Industrial, and Automotive.[3] Products include: fuses and protectors, suppressors, gas discharge tubes, electronic switches, solenoids, battery management devices, and protective relays.[3]
With the acquisition of Hamlin, Inc. in 2013, Littelfuse expanded its product offering to include sensors for the automotive, industrial and consumer industries.[1][2]
Acquisitions[edit]
Littelfuse has acquired multiple companies since 2003, including:

2003 - Teccor, a manufacturer of circuit and overvoltage protection products.[10][19][20]
2004 - Heinrich Industrie, a German manufacturer of circuit protection products, including the Wickmann brand.[6][21][22]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Edward V. Sundt founded Littelfuse in 1927 in Chicago Illinois as Littelfuse Laboratories.[4] Prior to founding Littelfuse, Sundt had worked for General Electric and Stewart-Warner, where he found diagnostic equipment frequently experienced electrical failure.[4] Sundt developed Littelfuse’s first product, a small protective fuse, to regulate current in diagnostic equipment and prevent electrical failure.[4] Littelfuse was incorporated and renamed Littelfuse, Inc. in 1938.[4]
Littelfuse became a public company in 1962.[4][5] The company retained founder Edward V. Sundt as the chairman of its board.[5] In 1963, Littelfuse moved its headquarters from Chicago to Des Plaines, Illinois.[4] Sundt retired in 1965 and was succeeded by Thomas Blake.[4] Tracor purchased the company in 1968.[6][4] Blake was made president of Littelfuse, which operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tracor.[7]
1970–1991[edit]
The company expanded its manufacturing base in the 1970s with new factories opening in Watseka, Illinois and Piedras Negras, Mexico.[4] In 1974, the company also introduced Littelites, electronic indicator lights used in industrial and office machinery, household appliances and computers.[4]
In 1976, Littelfuse developed Autofuse, which was the first blade-type fuse used in automobiles.[4] The Autofuse brand was counterfeited heavily and in 1983 the company obtained an exclusionary order from the United States International Trade Commission, which barred the importation of counterfeit blade-type fuses.[8]
In 1987, Westmark Systems purchased Tracor and its Littelfuse subsidiary in leveraged buyout.[9][10] Tracor filed for bankruptcy in 1991 and spun off Littelfuse.[9][11]
Modern history[edit]
Littelfuse reincorporated in November 1991 with Howard Witt as its president and CEO.[12] Witt had worked for Littelfuse since 1979 and had been president and CEO of Littelfuse since February 1990, when the company was still owned by Tracor.[12] In 1991, Littelfuse offered its second IPO in company history.[6] The company’s profits rose throughout the 1990s and the company expanded its operations in Europe and Asia.[4][9] Littelfuse also expanded into South America with a distribution and engineering center in São Paulo, Brazil.[4]
Gordon Hunter replaced Witt as president and CEO of Littelfuse at the end of 2004.[6] In 2008, Littelfuse restructured its manufacturing operations, closing 16 small manufacturing plants and opening 6 new, larger plants.[13] The company moved its headquarters from Des Plaines, Illinois to Chicago, Illinois the same year.[13]
The company was recognized as Product of the Year by Specifying Engineer in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Arrow Electronics recognized Littelfuse with an award for Supplier Excellence in 2011. The company received TTI Supplier's Excellence Award in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Littelfuse received the Chicago Innovation Award in 2012. In 2013, the company received Processing Magazine’s Breakthrough Product of the Year. Littelfuse was recognized as one of the Best Places to Work in Illinois in 2012, 2013 and 2014.[14][15][16][17]
The company announced in November 2016 that COO Dave Heinzmann would succeed Hunter as president and CEO in January 2017.[18]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Edward V. Sundt founded Littelfuse in 1927 in Chicago Illinois as Littelfuse Laboratories.[4] Prior to founding Littelfuse, Sundt had worked for General Electric and Stewart-Warner, where he found diagnostic equipment frequently experienced electrical failure.[4] Sundt developed Littelfuse’s first product, a small protective fuse, to regulate current in diagnostic equipment and prevent electrical failure.[4] Littelfuse was incorporated and renamed Littelfuse, Inc. in 1938.[4]
Littelfuse became a public company in 1962.[4][5] The company retained founder Edward V. Sundt as the chairman of its board.[5] In 1963, Littelfuse moved its headquarters from Chicago to Des Plaines, Illinois.[4] Sundt retired in 1965 and was succeeded by Thomas Blake.[4] Tracor purchased the company in 1968.[6][4] Blake was made president of Littelfuse, which operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tracor.[7]
1970–1991[edit]
The company expanded its manufacturing base in the 1970s with new factories opening in Watseka, Illinois and Piedras Negras, Mexico.[4] In 1974, the company also introduced Littelites, electronic indicator lights used in industrial and office machinery, household appliances and computers.[4]
In 1976, Littelfuse developed Autofuse, which was the first blade-type fuse used in automobiles.[4] The Autofuse brand was counterfeited heavily and in 1983 the company obtained an exclusionary order from the United States International Trade Commission, which barred the importation of counterfeit blade-type fuses.[8]
In 1987, Westmark Systems purchased Tracor and its Littelfuse subsidiary in leveraged buyout.[9][10] Tracor filed for bankruptcy in 1991 and spun off Littelfuse.[9][11]
Modern history[edit]
Littelfuse reincorporated in November 1991 with Howard Witt as its president and CEO.[12] Witt had worked for Littelfuse since 1979 and had been president and CEO of Littelfuse since February 1990, when the company was still owned by Tracor.[12] In 1991, Littelfuse offered its second IPO in company history.[6] The company’s profits rose throughout the 1990s and the company expanded its operations in Europe and Asia.[4][9] Littelfuse also expanded into South America with a distribution and engineering center in São Paulo, Brazil.[4]
Gordon Hunter replaced Witt as president and CEO of Littelfuse at the end of 2004.[6] In 2008, Littelfuse restructured its manufacturing operations, closing 16 small manufacturing plants and opening 6 new, larger plants.[13] The company moved its headquarters from Des Plaines, Illinois to Chicago, Illinois the same year.[13]
The company was recognized as Product of the Year by Specifying Engineer in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Arrow Electronics recognized Littelfuse with an award for Supplier Excellence in 2011. The company received TTI Supplier's Excellence Award in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Littelfuse received the Chicago Innovation Award in 2012. In 2013, the company received Processing Magazine’s Breakthrough Product of the Year. Littelfuse was recognized as one of the Best Places to Work in Illinois in 2012, 2013 and 2014.[14][15][16][17]
The company announced in November 2016 that COO Dave Heinzmann would succeed Hunter as president and CEO in January 2017.[18]
Products[edit]
Littelfuse designs and manufactures circuit protection products for the electronics, automotive and electrical industries.[2][3] The company operates between three business unit segments: Electronics, Industrial, and Automotive.[3] Products include: fuses and protectors, suppressors, gas discharge tubes, electronic switches, solenoids, battery management devices, and protective relays.[3]
With the acquisition of Hamlin, Inc. in 2013, Littelfuse expanded its product offering to include sensors for the automotive, industrial and consumer industries.[1][2]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Edward V. Sundt founded Littelfuse in 1927 in Chicago Illinois as Littelfuse Laboratories.[4] Prior to founding Littelfuse, Sundt had worked for General Electric and Stewart-Warner, where he found diagnostic equipment frequently experienced electrical failure.[4] Sundt developed Littelfuse’s first product, a small protective fuse, to regulate current in diagnostic equipment and prevent electrical failure.[4] Littelfuse was incorporated and renamed Littelfuse, Inc. in 1938.[4]
Littelfuse became a public company in 1962.[4][5] The company retained founder Edward V. Sundt as the chairman of its board.[5] In 1963, Littelfuse moved its headquarters from Chicago to Des Plaines, Illinois.[4] Sundt retired in 1965 and was succeeded by Thomas Blake.[4] Tracor purchased the company in 1968.[6][4] Blake was made president of Littelfuse, which operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tracor.[7]
1970–1991[edit]
The company expanded its manufacturing base in the 1970s with new factories opening in Watseka, Illinois and Piedras Negras, Mexico.[4] In 1974, the company also introduced Littelites, electronic indicator lights used in industrial and office machinery, household appliances and computers.[4]
In 1976, Littelfuse developed Autofuse, which was the first blade-type fuse used in automobiles.[4] The Autofuse brand was counterfeited heavily and in 1983 the company obtained an exclusionary order from the United States International Trade Commission, which barred the importation of counterfeit blade-type fuses.[8]
In 1987, Westmark Systems purchased Tracor and its Littelfuse subsidiary in leveraged buyout.[9][10] Tracor filed for bankruptcy in 1991 and spun off Littelfuse.[9][11]
Modern history[edit]
Littelfuse reincorporated in November 1991 with Howard Witt as its president and CEO.[12] Witt had worked for Littelfuse since 1979 and had been president and CEO of Littelfuse since February 1990, when the company was still owned by Tracor.[12] In 1991, Littelfuse offered its second IPO in company history.[6] The company’s profits rose throughout the 1990s and the company expanded its operations in Europe and Asia.[4][9] Littelfuse also expanded into South America with a distribution and engineering center in São Paulo, Brazil.[4]
Gordon Hunter replaced Witt as president and CEO of Littelfuse at the end of 2004.[6] In 2008, Littelfuse restructured its manufacturing operations, closing 16 small manufacturing plants and opening 6 new, larger plants.[13] The company moved its headquarters from Des Plaines, Illinois to Chicago, Illinois the same year.[13]
The company was recognized as Product of the Year by Specifying Engineer in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Arrow Electronics recognized Littelfuse with an award for Supplier Excellence in 2011. The company received TTI Supplier's Excellence Award in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Littelfuse received the Chicago Innovation Award in 2012. In 2013, the company received Processing Magazine’s Breakthrough Product of the Year. Littelfuse was recognized as one of the Best Places to Work in Illinois in 2012, 2013 and 2014.[14][15][16][17]
The company announced in November 2016 that COO Dave Heinzmann would succeed Hunter as president and CEO in January 2017.[18]
Products[edit]
Littelfuse designs and manufactures circuit protection products for the electronics, automotive and electrical industries.[2][3] The company operates between three business unit segments: Electronics, Industrial, and Automotive.[3] Products include: fuses and protectors, suppressors, gas discharge tubes, electronic switches, solenoids, battery management devices, and protective relays.[3]
With the acquisition of Hamlin, Inc. in 2013, Littelfuse expanded its product offering to include sensors for the automotive, industrial and consumer industries.[1][2]
Acquisitions[edit]
Littelfuse has acquired multiple companies since 2003, including:

2003 - Teccor, a manufacturer of circuit and overvoltage protection products.[10][19][20]
2004 - Heinrich Industrie, a German manufacturer of circuit protection products, including the Wickmann brand.[6][21][22]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Edward V. Sundt founded Littelfuse in 1927 in Chicago Illinois as Littelfuse Laboratories.[4] Prior to founding Littelfuse, Sundt had worked for General Electric and Stewart-Warner, where he found diagnostic equipment frequently experienced electrical failure.[4] Sundt developed Littelfuse’s first product, a small protective fuse, to regulate current in diagnostic equipment and prevent electrical failure.[4] Littelfuse was incorporated and renamed Littelfuse, Inc. in 1938.[4]
Littelfuse became a public company in 1962.[4][5] The company retained founder Edward V. Sundt as the chairman of its board.[5] In 1963, Littelfuse moved its headquarters from Chicago to Des Plaines, Illinois.[4] Sundt retired in 1965 and was succeeded by Thomas Blake.[4] Tracor purchased the company in 1968.[6][4] Blake was made president of Littelfuse, which operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tracor.[7]
1970–1991[edit]
The company expanded its manufacturing base in the 1970s with new factories opening in Watseka, Illinois and Piedras Negras, Mexico.[4] In 1974, the company also introduced Littelites, electronic indicator lights used in industrial and office machinery, household appliances and computers.[4]
In 1976, Littelfuse developed Autofuse, which was the first blade-type fuse used in automobiles.[4] The Autofuse brand was counterfeited heavily and in 1983 the company obtained an exclusionary order from the United States International Trade Commission, which barred the importation of counterfeit blade-type fuses.[8]
In 1987, Westmark Systems purchased Tracor and its Littelfuse subsidiary in leveraged buyout.[9][10] Tracor filed for bankruptcy in 1991 and spun off Littelfuse.[9][11]
Modern history[edit]
Littelfuse reincorporated in November 1991 with Howard Witt as its president and CEO.[12] Witt had worked for Littelfuse since 1979 and had been president and CEO of Littelfuse since February 1990, when the company was still owned by Tracor.[12] In 1991, Littelfuse offered its second IPO in company history.[6] The company’s profits rose throughout the 1990s and the company expanded its operations in Europe and Asia.[4][9] Littelfuse also expanded into South America with a distribution and engineering center in São Paulo, Brazil.[4]
Gordon Hunter replaced Witt as president and CEO of Littelfuse at the end of 2004.[6] In 2008, Littelfuse restructured its manufacturing operations, closing 16 small manufacturing plants and opening 6 new, larger plants.[13] The company moved its headquarters from Des Plaines, Illinois to Chicago, Illinois the same year.[13]
The company was recognized as Product of the Year by Specifying Engineer in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Arrow Electronics recognized Littelfuse with an award for Supplier Excellence in 2011. The company received TTI Supplier's Excellence Award in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Littelfuse received the Chicago Innovation Award in 2012. In 2013, the company received Processing Magazine’s Breakthrough Product of the Year. Littelfuse was recognized as one of the Best Places to Work in Illinois in 2012, 2013 and 2014.[14][15][16][17]
The company announced in November 2016 that COO Dave Heinzmann would succeed Hunter as president and CEO in January 2017.[18]
Products[edit]
Littelfuse designs and manufactures circuit protection products for the electronics, automotive and electrical industries.[2][3] The company operates between three business unit segments: Electronics, Industrial, and Automotive.[3] Products include: fuses and protectors, suppressors, gas discharge tubes, electronic switches, solenoids, battery management devices, and protective relays.[3]
With the acquisition of Hamlin, Inc. in 2013, Littelfuse expanded its product offering to include sensors for the automotive, industrial and consumer industries.[1][2]
Acquisitions[edit]
Littelfuse has acquired multiple companies since 2003, including:

2003 - Teccor, a manufacturer of circuit and overvoltage protection products.[10][19][20]
2004 - Heinrich Industrie, a German manufacturer of circuit protection products, including the Wickmann brand.[6][21][22]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
