For information on how it can be removed visit RateMDs for Doctors.Dr. Roland SingUrologist20 reviewsRatings for Dr. Umesh Jain 5Staff 3Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI have been going to Dr. Umesh for over two years for my prostate questions. I found him to be very knowledgeable and helpful. He is also flexible and does not impose on me any procedure and always asks about my consent. The staff have also been civil and accommodating. In the past, there were issues with wait times, overbooking and patient overflow but lately that problem seems to have been reduced possibly because of the patients'complaints.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted July 15, 2017 5Staff 3Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeHe ran into us in the emergency ward when my wife had been waiting a long time, and out of kindness, speeded the whole process when we were in difficult circumstances. He reached out for us when we needed help, and are are grateful.
Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted December 20, 2016 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeHaven't seen the doctor yet, still waiting in the waiting room ... 20 people in front of
me. Appointment to see the doctor was
scheduled 6 months ago.

A definite recommendationWas this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted February 25, 2016 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5Knowledgegreat doctor with a great knowledge in his field. brilliant bedside manner!Was this rating useful? 3 flag | Submitted January 15, 2016 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeIf it hadn't been for Dr. Jain putting a stent in my kidney I wouldn't be sitting here now typing this review. He saved my life and I'm grateful everyday for what he did. At the time I wasn't aware of the staff but feel assure that they were excellent too.Was this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted December 13, 2015 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI am also surprised by the negative comments. Dr. Jain performed a radical prostatectomy on my husband to remove his cancerous prostate almost 10 years ago now and he has been seeing Dr. Jain once a year since then. We were both very impressed with him then with his skill and knowledge and compassionate demeanor and we are still impressed today. My husband has not had any issue with any of his staff. We would definitely refer Dr. Jain. Was this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted July 28, 2015 4Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI am a bit surprised by the negative comments here. Sure, the staff isn't the best that I've ever had. But his compassion and approach to solving problems makes him one of the star doctors that I've had. He is very good at his job: he is effective, honest and compassionate. He makes you feel respected, informed me well about my treatment options and I felt very little pain after my procedure compared to what I expected. Very professional. I couldn't ask for a better urologist. I trust him very much.Was this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted December 17, 2014 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeDr Jain is conceited and his priority is to brag about himself. Perhaps he restricts his behaviour for a selected group of patients why few are impressed with him. He gave me instructions to follow as though it was my second appt. We had to bring it to his attention, then he checked my file and said "oh I see you're doing better". That was my last visit. Now I have a doctor who is knowledgeable, caring, humble and with an approachable personality. Dr Jain's staff is equally as miserable and the patients should not be exposed to that type of environment.Was this rating useful? 3 flag | Submitted November 12, 2014 Rate this DoctorDr. Umesh Jain's Credentials Facility AffiliationsUmesh Jain Clinic Toronto Accepting New PatientsUnavailable BiographyUnavailable LanguagesUnavailable EducationUnavailable Other SpecialtiesUnavailable Areas of ExpertiseUnavailable Awards & RecognitionsUnavailable Publications & ResearchUnavailableInsurance accepted by this DoctorOther patients have successfully used these insurance providers, please call the Doctor's office to find out if your insurance plan is accepted.Blue Cross / Blue ShieldCIGNAUnited Healthcare
