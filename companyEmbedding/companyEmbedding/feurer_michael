William Myers - Miller Asset Management
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Trans World Entertainment Third Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. 
I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Bob Higgins, Chairman of Trans World Entertainment Corporation. Sir, you may begin.
Bob Higgins
Thank you, Amanda. Thank you for joining us, as we discuss our third quarter and year-to-date results. On the call with me today are Mike Feurer, our Chief Executive Officer; and John Anderson, our Chief Financial Officer. As you know, Mike joined our company October 13th of this year. He has an extensive retail background with wide and direct experience, including strategy, branding, merchandizing, marketing, web, real estate, sourcing and production, as well as planning and allocation. Mike has hit the ground running and has added energy and excitement to the company and is enhancing our strategic vision. I’m confident Mike is the right person to lead the company into the future. 
Now I’ll let Mike take you through our results. Mike?
Michael Feurer
Thank you, Bob. Just a few comments before we review the results. I’ve been with the company for just over a month and joined Trans World Entertainment holding a very strong belief in the bright future for the company and I’m even more encouraged after the experience of the past few weeks. The company has a tremendous opportunity to continue its evolution as the destination for entertainment centric and pop culture related product. 
Now let me review the results for the third quarter. Our net loss was $4.5 million as compared to a net loss of $3.3 million in the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date our net loss was $10 million compared to a net loss of $4.3 million during the same period in 2013. 
For the third quarter, our comp sales were down 1.8%. Total sales for the quarter decreased 9.2% to $72 million compared to an $80 million for the same period last year as our stores and operation declined by 8%.
Now some comments on our merchandize category performance for the quarter. Video comp sales were down 3%. Video sales were negatively impacted by weaker new releases resulting from the decline in box office sales earlier this year, this summer. Video represented 45% of our business for the quarter compared to 46% last year. Music comp sales declined 10%. The music category represents 27% of our business for the quarter compared to 30% last year as we continue to shift space and inventory investment from this category. 
Trend comp sales increased 22%. Trend sales represented 15% of our business for the quarter compared to 12% last year. Electronics comp sales increased 5%. Electronic sales represented 9% of our business for the quarter compared to 8% last year. Video games comp sales were down 10% for the quarter as we were not able to offset the release of Grand Theft Auto in the comparable quarter last year. Game sales represented 4% of our business for the quarter, equal to 4% last year.
 John will now take you through the financial highlights for the quarter in more detail. John>
John Anderson
Thanks Mike. Good morning. As Mike mentioned, our net loss for the quarter was $4.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share as compared to last year’s net loss of $3.3 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Year-to-date, the net loss was $10 million compared to a net loss of $4.3 million last year. 

EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $3 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million last year. Year-to-date, EBITDA was a loss of $5.8 million compared to $27,000 last year. 
Our gross margin rate for the quarter increased 90 basis points from last year to 39.4% of sales driven by improved margin rates in the majority of our categories.
SG&A expenses were $31.6 million, a reduction of 2.9% or $1 million from last year’s third quarter. The decrease in SG&A expenses was driven by the reduction in store count, partially offset by $800,000 in fees related to a legal settlement and expenses associated with the appointment of the new CEO. SG&A expenses as a percent of sales was 43.6% compared to 40.8% for the same period last year. 
Net interest expense was $469,000 in the quarter versus $481,000 last year. 
We ended the quarter with cash of $79 million compared to $86 million last year. The company has returned approximately $20 million to our shareholders over the last 12 months through the payment of a special dividend and the repurchase of company shares.
Year-over-year, we have lowered our inventory by $17 million and finished the quarter with $158 million in inventory, 10% below last year’s $175 million. 
We ended the quarter with 327 stores and 1.9 million square feet in operation versus last year’s 360 stores and 2.1 million square feet.
Now I will turn it back over to Mike.
Michael Feurer
Thanks John. The quarter included several highlights. Our growth categories have been well received by the customer and continue to deliver positive comps. We continue to improve gross margin rates in a majority of our merchandize categories through disciplined price management. During the quarter we also opened a new concept store in Woodbridge Mall in Woodbridge, New Jersey. While still early, we are encouraged by the results thus far. The store provides a shift in inventory mix and an improved merchandizing and visual presentation for our growth categories, while maintaining a strong presence in video and music. The shift in inventory mix and improved presentation has been favorably received by the customer and we’re looking forward to seeing how the store performs in the important holiday season. 
As John also mentioned, we ended the quarter with cash of $79 million. And the company continues to repurchase shares under the stock repurchase program established by the board of directors.
Now I would like to open the call for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question or comment comes from William Myers from Miller Asset Management. Your line is open.
William Myers - Miller Asset Management
Good morning. Very impressive comps in the trend category. Could you talk a little bit more about that and whether that might become really the prime category for your chain as time goes on?
Michael Feurer
Thanks William and yes, they were impressive comps in that category and as mentioned, 15% contribution versus 12% last year. For competitive reasons, we’re not going to get into the detail of that product offering, but I would suffice it to say we are very encouraged by our results in this important category. 
William Myers - Miller Asset Management
Okay. If I could try one more question. How does trend gross margin compare to margins in your other categories?
Michael Feurer
Again for competitive reasons I won’t get into specifics, but it is a healthier -- it is definitely a healthier net margin than some of the traditional categories we’ve been operating in and very encouraging I will say that.
William Myers - Miller Asset Management
Okay. I’ll take healthier. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Sir, at this moment I’m showing no further questions. 
Michael Feurer

Bob, any thoughts?
Bob Higgins
Yes. I would just like to thank everybody for your time today and hope everyone has a safe and happy holiday season. We will be releasing our holiday sales results on January 8 and that will just be a sales results press release. And we look forward to talking to you on about our fourth quarter and annual results on March 5, 2015. So if everyone will put that on their calendar I’d appreciate it. Thank you very much. I think Mike as I said earlier, has hit the ground running and he will be doing the calls going forward. So thank you very much for your time and your support. Thank you and thank you, Amanda.
Operator
Thank you, sir and thank you, ladies and gentlemen for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Greetings and welcome to the Trans World Entertainment Corporation Fourth Quarter and Annual 2016 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Feurer, Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Michael Feurer
Thank you, Brenda. Good morning. Thank you for joining us as we discuss our fourth quarter and annual results. On the call with me today are John Anderson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Hoffman, our Chief Merchandising Officer. Before I begin, I would like to comment on the passing of Bob Higgins.
All of us at Trans World were deeply saddened by his passing, serving as its relentless champion, Bob was proud of Trans World Entertainment and all of its associates. His never ending drive to excellence, determination and commitment to our Company of the standard that will inspire and stay with us as we honor the legacy he created over the last 45 years. We will miss him greatly.
Before John reviews our financial results, I'd like to provide highlights from this past year. During the year, we completed the acquisition of etailz, an innovative and leading high growth digital marketplace retailer. Our results demonstrate the importance benefit and potential of our acquisition of etailz. Trans World sales growth is directly attributable to the diversification of our business into the fastest growing segment of retail, the digital marketplace.
With etailz contributing a quarter of our sales and trending upward, our business is correctly positioned for growth. In addition, we greatly improved our digital and marketing capabilities through the acquisition of key talent. We engaged dynamic alliances and collaborations required to unlock the potential of Trans World Entertainment.
In our FYE segment, we created a new store model, which coupled with our digital initiatives has elevated the brand and customer experience. We experienced double-digit growth in our lifestyle categories, which contributed 43% of our sales in 2016 versus 33% in 2015. However, we were impacted by the acceleration of negative mall traffic and the ongoing disruption in our heritage media categories. These headwinds will continue to impact our brick and mortar business in 2017 and as such we will continue to evaluate and rebalance our store portfolio.
Now, John will take you through financials highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.
John Anderson
Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. I will be touching on the combined results of the FYE and etailz segments. The breakout of the segments was included in our press release. For the fourth quarter our net income was $7.9 million or $0.22 per diluted share as compared to a net income of $9.9 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year.
The decrease in net income was primarily driven in the FYE segment by a 6.9% decline in comparable store sales and 120 basis points decline in gross profit, partially offset by a $5.2 million reduction and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA as presented in one of our press release was $10.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to $11.8 million for the same period last year. Total revenue increased 20% compared to last year to $147 million for the quarter driven by $36 million from etailz.

Now let me touch on our annual results. Total revenue increased 4% to $354 million compared to $340 million in fiscal 2015 driven by $40 million in revenue from etailz for the Post Acquisition Period. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.6 million as compared to $8 million for the same period last year.
For the year, our net income including a $7 million tax benefit and $3.1 million in costs related to our acquisition of etailz was $2.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share as compared to net income of $2.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share in 2015. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal 2016 were $28 million compared to $104 million at the end of last year. The primary use of cash was $65 million related to the acquisition and operation of etailz.
Additional uses of cash included technology enhancements, the repurchase of shares, investment in our new and remodeled stores and the chain wide rollout of new marketplace fixtures to support the shift in our merchandising assortment. Inventory, including $16 million from etailz, was $126 million at the end of fiscal 2016 versus $120 million at the end of fiscal 2015.
Excluding the impact of etailz inventory per square foot was $69 at the end of fiscal 2016, the same level as last year. We ended the year with 284 stores and 1.6 million square feet in operation versus last years 299 stores and 1.7 million square feet.
Now, Scott will take you through our merchandising sales highlights.
Scott Hoffman
Thanks, John. Good morning. I will now review our results by category for the FYE segment. Comparable sales for our FYE segment for the quarter were down 6.9% versus last year. For the year comparable store sales declined 3.6%. In our trend category, comp sales increased 18% for the quarter. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to strengthen our assortment, shift our inventory mix, and improve our product presentation and value proposition.
Trend represented 38% of our business for the quarter compared to 29% last year. For the year comp sales for trend increased 31%. Trend represented 32% of our business for the year compared to 22% last year. For the quarter electronics comp sales increased 1%. Electronics represented 15% of our business for the quarter compared to 13% last year. For the year comp sales for electronics also increased 1% and represented 11% of our business for the year compared to 9% last year.
Video comp sales declined 20% for the quarter. Video represented 28% of our business during the quarter compared to 33% last year. For the year comp sales for video declined 15%. Video represented 34% of our business during the year compared to 43% last year. Music comp sales declined 22% for the quarter. The music category represented 18% of our business for the quarter compared to 22% last year. For the year comp sales for music declined 16%. The music category represented 22% of our business for the year compared to 26% last year.
Both the video and music categories were impacted by weaker new releases this year compared to last year. While these categories continue to decline, they still represent 56% of our business. We are focused on providing our loyal customers a strong selection in these categories.
Now, I’ll turn it back over to Mike.
Michael Feurer
Thank you, Scott. The etailz acquisition represents a significant step forward in our reinvention. We believe the rapid growth of marketplace sales will continue and is clear evidence of the vibrant long-term trends underway in retailing. With etailz contributing a quarter of our sales and trending upward our business is correctly positioned for growth.
Our strategy for 2017 will focus on embracing changing consumer preferences, reallocating our resources and enhancing our capabilities to better serve our customers in the channel of their choice. Our progress onboarding digital and marketing talent, accelerated through the etailz acquisition will enable the Company to continue to build upon its credibility with fans of entertainment and pop culture.

Trans World is growing and diversifying through re-platforming and upgrading our digital foundation, collaborating with entertainment partners, embracing a data and development approach, and immediately immersing into the vibrant digital marketplace. etailz’s expertise and marketplace leadership, coupled with FYE’s experience in the entertainment category, unlocks a unique opportunity for Trans World to engage, compete, and thrive.
We will continue to deliver on our vision to maximize the tools and capabilities we’ve constructed, acquired and are developing to capitalize on the opportunity to create a next-generation 360 degree consumer commerce model.
Now I would like to open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Hertz with Hertz Investments. Please go ahead with your questions.
Michael Hertz
Hi. I was hoping you can give us a little more detail on the quarter for etailz. Just to give us an idea of the growth that took place in the fourth quarter versus last year?
Michael Feurer
Yes. Overall, the etailz were up kind of for the year, if you look [that end of the] standalone, they were up about 30% and in the fourth quarter, they were up just under 10% on the topline.
Michael Hertz
And is the fourth quarter by far their best quarter or is it less seasonal than our business?
Michael Feurer
It is less seasonal than our business, but it does have a seasonality to it.
Michael Hertz
Thank you very much.
Michael Feurer
Welcome.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the lines of William Meyers with Miller Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question.
William Meyers
Hi. Yes, you used the term unlock potential, I think referring to etailz and FYE. Can you give us a little bit of detail, I mean in my imagination that something like etailz helping to sell the physical product that's in your stores or warehouses. Is that right?
Michael Feurer
Hi, William. It's Michael. Great question. Without getting into too many specifics, we did reveal that we are going to be operating etailz as a standalone business. I think that is very prudent, but at the same time there are synergies that will be unlocking. There are things like – the things you mentioned, but vendor access as an example or costing or even a corporate data approach and in the future trend identification, I mean these are just a couple of the things that we're already unlocking through this relationship.
William Meyers
Okay. If I could just follow-up on that, tell me about trend identification?
Michael Feurer
Again, without getting into too many specifics about the underlying technology, it is a data driven approach and a data driven merchandising approach that etailz engages in. And so through that data approach and algorithms et cetera they do identify trending opportunities in the marketplace.
William Meyers
Okay. Thanks. It sounds good.
End of Q&A
Operator
Okay. Thank you. This concludes today’s Q&A. I would like to turn the call back to management for closing comments.
Michael Feurer
Thank you, Brenda. I would like to thank you for your time today. We look forward to talking to you about our first quarter 2017 results in May. Thank you everyone.
Operator

Michael Feuer: Adding drama to sale of health products with Max-Wellness
By Mary Vanac

WESTLAKE, Ohio — In 1988, Michael Feuer helped createÂ office supply superstoreÂ OfficeMax.
“All we did was took the stuff out of the boxes, brought it to life, let people touch it, feel it and added a sense of drama and theater,” Feuer said.
Now, the self-described “marketing, creative, writing” guy is adding a sense of drama toÂ health and wellness products. The name of his store? Max-Wellness, of course.
Feuer, a savvy retailer who plans aÂ  national rollout for Max-Wellness, also thinks now is the right time to cash in on the $100 billion-a-year wellness industry.
A dedicated runner, Feuer has been interested in health and wellness for most of his adult life. As aÂ trustee for University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, he has shadowed brain surgeons in the operating room andÂ pediatricians in the neonatal intensive care unit. HeÂ has counted the cost of making people well.
What if fewer people got sick? “There’s nothing more important than the gift of health,”Â says Feuer, who recently donated bone marrow to his brotherÂ facing end-stage cancer. The government and employers cannot reform health care; people have to work at staying well. “If you stay well, you bring the economic benefit to yourself and the country,” he said.

“Wellness lives here,” Feuer says as he holds the door for a visitor toÂ his first Max-Wellness store in Westlake, Ohio. The 6,000-square-foot store with its 7,000 products has been open one hour and 20 minutes.Â Another Ohio store and two Florida stores are planned to open within four weeks.
Feuer and his associates have three goals forÂ Max-Wellness: enhance the quality of life, prevent illness and treat illness.
“A year ago when we started thinking about this, we never expected all this excitement about wellness,” Feuer said. “I have a very simple business theory: I’d rather be lucky than good. However, when one is lucky,Â you have to be smart enough to know there’s an opportunity. And then you seize it.”
Feuer knows retailing. He asks customers what they want and then he listens. While doing market research for Max-Wellness, Feuer realized that people see themselves as they want to be, not as they are.
SoÂ he adorned his store with bright oranges and greens — no sedate browns and beiges here.Â And he pipes in scents. “We’re testing ‘clean, fresh air’ now. People need to be happy, feel good,” he says.
His storeÂ greets visitors with aÂ “cure du jour” section,Â  he says. In this season of New Year’s resolutions,Â glass display shelves ofÂ cold and flu, weight-loss and smoking-cessation products.
The Max-Wellness heart health area stocks simple blood pressure monitors to expensive automated defibrillators.Â “We plan to work very closely with the medical community … to provideÂ the right product for the right need,”Â he says.
The electronic tablet in Feuer’s hand will help match customer needs with products. Loaded on the tablet is MaxAnwers –Â purchased consumer-health software to which he and his staff ofÂ wellness professionals have added a lot of information. “It’s like WebMD on steroids,” he says.
“First and foremost, we want to provide answers for healthy living,”Â  he says, showingÂ off shelves of sleep, exercise and hydration products.
There’s the vitamin wall, whichÂ stocksÂ dietary supplements for the most serious of athletes to people who areÂ trying toÂ stay young. “Ninety-five percent of what we carry is organic,” Feuer says. “We are not competing with CVS, Walgreens or Rite Aid.” Shoppers can smellÂ the aromatherapy section.
The back two-thirds of the store housesÂ products that needÂ sensitivity to sell. A footwear section offers a machine that tells you what orthotics would solveÂ lower back pain when you run. CrocsRx footwear are aÂ prescriptiveÂ line of the ubiquitousÂ rubber clogs.
ThereÂ is footwear, socks and support hosiery for people who have diabetes,Â health and wellness books that offer the latest advice, and a section dedicated to sexual wellnessÂ that offers expensive vibrators and how-to videos. “Hopefully, everything is tastefully packaged,” Feuer says.
Mobility products — scooters, wheelchairs, walkers, rollators and canes — are displayed in a brightly litÂ section that features an oval-shaped test track. “How do you buy a car without test driving it?” Feuer asks.
The incontinence productsÂ section offers large black plastic “sensitivity bags” meant to give buyers privacy. The bathroom safety section offersÂ rails and bars of every sort, shower and transfer benches, andÂ a low-threshold bathtub. An orthopedics section stocksÂ an array of joint braces.
“The thing we keep pushing is respect, dignity,” Feuer says.Â Â “A third of our customers will have an issue. Do they need the added aggravation of being treated like a dog? No.”
Then, there’s the confessional — a two-sided desk behind smoked glass — where customers will be able to discretelyÂ tell their problems to staff. Feuer got the idea from the Catholic confessional, where the faithful tell their sins to a priest, often behind the anonymity of an opaque screen. Piped-in sound willÂ mask what you’re talking about, he says.
Feuer hiredÂ someÂ therapists and trainers to staff the store.Â “One of our criteria is we hire healthy people. We want people to have a passion about their work. This is all about staying well.”
A large-screen televisionÂ  behind the check-out counter willÂ broadcast wellness messages and tips. An area of the store hasÂ displays that can be moved to make way for tables and chairs. “Starting next week, we’ll have daily wellness seminars,” Feuer says.
As a retailer, Feuer realizes that attractive packaging and attentive, knowledgeable staff can make sales. He’s also hoping customers willÂ drop by at least once a month for a different reason. “Once they start to feel good, they’ll be afraid to stop coming,” he says.
FeuerÂ expects to get more satisfaction out of selling wellness products than he did office supplies. “Here, the excitement is the products that we carry can help people have a better life.”

Michael Feurer, Co-founder of Office Max
Originally published: 11.01.11 by
                    Terry Tanker

     






  Terry Tanker met with Michael Feuer, who co-founded OfficeMax in 1988, with $20,000 of his own money. During a 16-year span, Feuer, as CEO, grew the company to almost 1,000 stores worldwide with annual sales of about $5 billion before selling this retail giant for almost $1.5 billion in 2003.
 
1. What would surprise people about you?
I’m a motorcycle rider. I even raced them when I was younger.
2. Personally, how do you keep your business edge?
I’m into physical fitness because it keeps me in “fighting” shape. I work out six days a week.
3. Can you sum up your business philosophy?
Always look at what you are trying to sell through the eyes of the consumer. Secondly, always have a back-up plan. Plan A usually never works as intended, so you need to be flexible and adapt. Trust, but always verify. And finally, stir the pot. I hate the phrase if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. Break it so you can make it better.
4. You have a new book out, The Benevolent Dictator. Why did you write it?
I’ve always enjoyed writing. I find the process energizing. A good writer has to be a good thinker, and I enjoy











thinking.
5. Where can our readers buy a copy?
Amazon.com, my website thebenevolentdictator.biz or any large retailer.
6. In addition to the book, you have a new business venture — Max-Wellness. What is the business concept?
It’s a store for every age, at every stage of life, featuring over 7,000 products to enhance life, help prevent illness, and treat wellness issues. It’s the fruition and realization that companies and the government cannot be expected to continue to take care of everyone. Individuals have to take responsibility for their own health needs and those of their family. Companies can’t do it anymore. It’s too expensive.
7. How will you launch the brand?
We’ve opened six brick-and-mortar stores [at time of interview], we have our online store, and soon you will see “Wellness in a Box,” which is similar to the Best Buy vending machines you see in airports. Ours will be in hospitals, hotels, urgent-care centers, exercise facilities, and senior-living centers. The products offered will be specific to each location. We also have Mini- Max, which operates smaller-version stores in hospitals.
8. As a retailer, do you like having the stores? Are they a necessity?
Yes to both. The stores are part of the branding process. They anchor the business and serve as a great laboratory to test new products and concepts.
 9. You have an interesting approach to business plans. What’s your philosophy?
Entrepreneurs like to write these painfully long and detailed five-year plans; but too many companies die in the first year, so what good are they? In this digital age, change happens in minutes rather than weeks, months, or years.
10. How difficult is it to get your management team to think along the same lines?
The name of my book answers that question. What it means is that as the boss, your job is to do what’s right for the greater good of all involved — employees, customers, whomever. The dictator piece simply means when the time for talking is done, your job is to make the decision and decide which fork in the road to take.
11. Why do so many CEOs run companies with three- and five-year plans?
Comfort and safety. If things aren’t going well, it buys you time.
12. Do you have any other advice about business plans in general?
Don’t fall in love with how you’re going to do something. Instead fall in love with what you will accomplish, and change your methods and techniques as needed to make the results better.
13. You quoted Kenny Rogers’ lyrics, “you’ve got to know when to hold ’em, fold ‘em, and walk away,” as great business advice. Why?
Most business people don’t know when to pull the plug, get up and leave, or simply change. No one likes to lose. Sometimes the smartest course of action is to walk away.
14. How often do entrepreneurs make the right decision when they reach phase two (after getting started), as described in your book?
Not very often. Most entrepreneurs are creative or simply good at getting out of the starting blocks, but don’t know how to get to the next level. When you start out and have one store, you do everything — design, production, marketing, sales. Thing are great, and you have lots of energy. But when you have multiple stores, you have to know how to accomplish objectives through others.
15. Entrepreneurs often aren’t good delegators. Why?
Entrepreneurs tend to do many things well themselves. One of their fears (and dangers) is letting go of things they do well.
16. What’s the best way to manage business risk?
First, identify the risks, and the down side. What is the worst-case scenario? And then know your limits. How much pain can you endure either mentally or without going out of business? You can’t manage what you don’t know. Once you know, you can make decisions on how deep you can go.
17. How many landmines were you able to sidestep while setting up Max-Wellness because of your OfficeMax experiences?
Literally hundreds. You’re always smarter the second time around because you know what your tolerances are.
18. Why do entrepreneurs need a sense of “Fear of Failure,” or FOF, as you call it?
As soon as you believe you’re as good as you think you are, it’s over. Don’t take anything for granted.
19. What’s the best way to motivate co-workers?
Make them part of the process. History shows us the best leaders pick a common enemy. Get them to focus on a common enemy or common cause. Get everyone focused.
20. Do you have any parting words of wisdom?
Share as much information as you can with everyone you can. Let co-workers know they have a chance to go farther faster with you than any other place, and they are limited only by their own energy, ingenuity, and ability.
