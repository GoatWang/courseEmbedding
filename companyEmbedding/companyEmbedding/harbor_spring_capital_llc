 Career History



Analyst

                                    2013 - Current                


Harbor Spring Capital LLC


                  Harbor Spring Capital seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation through investments in the global securities markets. Assets of the funds are invested primarily in long and short positions in publicly-traded equities, but from time to time may also be invested in fixed-income products, hybrid securities, derivatives, private securities and other financial instruments. The funds' investment strategy is based on fundamental analysis of companies, securities and financial instruments, emphasizing a rigorous, systematic, creative and proprietary research process. Harbor Spring attempts to identify investment opportunities in which securities prices diverge from intrinsic value. The funds may have substantial investments in the technology industry, the media industry and the telecommunications industry. They may be relatively concentrated, engage in short selling and invest in small- to mid-cap companies.

Dialectic Capital Management LP


                  Dialectic Capital Management (DCM) employs the following investment strategies: Buy and Hold, Global Equities, Fundamental Value, Growth, Fixed Income & Debt Securities, Option Trading, Short Selling, Short-Term Market Timing, Leverage, and Real Estate. In the equities markets, the firm generally focuses on global equities, with particular emphasis on technology, consumer, financial and cyclical sectors. For their growth investments, DCM uses a variety of financial instruments such as derivatives, options, interest rate swaps, caps and floors, futures and forward contracts for risk management purposes.

The firm investment process is designed to ensure that any proposed investment is compatible with the client’s investment strategy and objectives.

Valiant Capital Management LP


                  Valiant Capital Management (VCM) employs a global, long/short equity investment approach that is designed to generate superior risk-adjusted returns through a flexible investment mandate.

VCM invests a portion of their funds’ assets in illiquid securities, which generally are restricted securities of public and private companies. The funds also invest in preferred stocks, convertible securities, warrants, rights, options (including covered and uncovered puts and calls and over-the-counter options), swaps and other derivative instruments, bonds and other fixed income securities, non-US currencies, futures, options on futures, other commodity interests and money market instruments. In managing their funds, VCM engages in short-selling, margin trading, hedging and other investment strategies.

Thomas Weisel Partners


                  Thomas Weisel Partners Group, Inc., also known as TWP or Weisel, is a U.S. growth focused investment banking firm based in San Francisco, California.

The firm was launched in January 1999 by Thom Weisel and other personnel from the former Montgomery Securities. In 1997, Thom Weisel helped to orchestrate a $1.3 billion acquisition of Montgomery Securities by NationsBank. The following year, however, NationsBank acquired BankAmerica Corp, which itself had acquired Technology-based rival Robertson Stephens. A culture clash and fight for control ensued at the newly combined investment banking units of what is now known as Banc of America Securities. In the process, senior bankers from Montgomery Securities secured backing from the Silicon Valley Venture Capital community and left to form their own venture: Thomas Weisel Partners.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for IHS (NYSE:IHS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.33)Consensus Price Target: $44.67 (61.90% downside)
