Today was my daughter’s last day of occupational therapy. Sometimes the biggest blessings come from where and when you least expect them to. I want to thank Sally Aitken, one of Epic’s therapists, so much for everything she has done with and for my daughter. Sally was so patient and understanding with us and has helped me understand my little girl so much better. Sally has seemed like a part of our extended family for the past three years, and we appreciate everything she’s done!
– Martha S.


I don’t know where we would be today if Epic Health Services hadn’t been brought into our lives. My son has had so many close calls to his life while the rest of us were sleeping soundly. A nurse was there to save his life and get us up and awake with a sense of urgency … I appreciate it with my whole heart and soul.
– Karen G.


I wouldn’t trade our therapy team for anything in the world. This is my team, and as long as my child needs therapy, he will get it from Epic!
– Laquesha F.


I became a nurse in order to make a difference in people’s lives … I believe that strong communication between an interdisciplinary team and the family is the best way to ensure that each client’s needs are being addressed. I am dedicated to ensuring that the quality of care and type of service we provide are exactly what is needed by each client and family.
– Lesa


I was looking for an employment package comprised of many options. I also felt a desire to work for a company with a solid reputation in the community, as well as with doctors, hospitals and clinics. But most importantly, I wanted to work for a company that maintains a high moral standard.
– Liz

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

A Visionary’s Approach to Rehabilitation:
"There is a movement to make nursing homes 'like home', but our patients/residents are smart. They know that 'home' is the place where they raised their children and that a nursing facility is not that place. However, everyone loves being in a hotel and that luxury hotel atmosphere is something that we at EPIC work hard to replicate."

  Mark Neuman CFO

Hepatitis C Program - Epic Health





















































Navigation



Epic Health
Infectious Diseases | Augusta, GA










Hepatitis C Program 


Although current incident rates include 3.2 million undiagnosed Americans, until recently, Hepatitis C (HCV) information was scarce. Because the public was wholly uneducated regarding HCV infections, it became a silent killer.
“Baby Boomers” should be alerted to the prevalence of HCV. Transmission is easier than one might think. Risk factors include blood transfusion prior to 1992, injecting of illicit drugs, snorting of drugs, amateur tattoos and even unsanitary manicures/pedicures.
Because of the ease of transmission, HCV is reported to be as common as 3 out of 10 persons within risk categories (i.e. “baby boomers”). It is important for those within these risk categories to get tested, even if you are not experiencing traditional symptoms.
At Epic Health we provide free screening for Hepatitis C (HCV). Click here or call 706-434-1590 to speak with a clinical specialist to arrange your screening.
Know your status and take control of your health. Let us help.

Middletown Park Rehabilitation and Health Care Center Receives 2014 Commitment to Quality Award
 Middletown Park Rehabilitation and Health Care Center has been recognized as a 2014 recipient of the Bronze — Commitment to Quality Award, for its dedication to improving the lives of residents through quality care.
The award is the first of three distinctions possible through the National Quality Award program, presented by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living . The program honors centers across the nation that have demonstrated their commitment to improving quality care for seniors and individuals with disabilities.
Implemented by AHCA/NCAL in 1996, the National Quality Award Program is centered on the core values and criteria of the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program, which assists providers of long-term and post-acute care services in achieving performance excellence goals.
The program has three levels: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Centers begin the quality improvement process at the Bronze level, where they develop an organizational profile with performance elements such as vision and mission statements and an assessment of customers' expectations. Bronze applicants must also demonstrate their ability to implement a performance improvement system.
As a recipient of the Bronze Award, Middletown Park Rehabilitation and Health Care Center may now move forward in developing approaches and achieving performance levels that meet the criteria required for the Silver — Achievement in Quality Award.
Middletown Park Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center representatives have been invited to Washington DC to receive this distinguished Award and to be honored at an Award Ceremony on October 7th, 2014.

Prestigious Starfish Award Presented to Lizer Jozefovic and Sandy Mozdierz
In recognition of the amazing support system that they provide to Pets Alive, the prestigious Starfish Award was bestowed upon Lizer Jozefovic and Sandy Mozdierz at the 2011 Fur Ball fundraiser. They have facilitated community involvement via EPIC's network of facilities – coordinating fundraisers and donations for Pets Alive, enabling the organization to save and help even more animals.
The Starfish Award was created from the story of a man that is walking along the beach. He sees another man also walking along the beach but this man is stopping every few feet to toss stranded starfish back into the sea. The first man says "Tell me why you bother? Why you waste your time this way? There's a million stranded starfish. What does it matter, anyway?" And the second man softly replies: "Well, I think it matters to this one."

2011 Pets Alive Fur Ball
Epic Healthcare Management is proud to have been the Cocktail Sponsor for the 2011 Pets Alive Fur Ball! Pets Alive brings so much love to the animals and the community – doing their utmost to help our companion animals, our youth, and people in need. Residents at EPIC facilities gain tremendous satisfaction and joy when this special organization pays a visit with their animals. You should see their faces light up as they interact with the engaging pets.

June 2010 Featured Facilities: Managing Health Today
The June 2010 edition of Managing Health Today featured Skyview, Waterview Hills, Water’s Edge and Salem Hills Rehabilitation & Healthcare. These facilities are owned and operated by Lizer Jozefovic and his brother-in-law, Mark Neuman. The article describes how Lizer Josefovic revolutionized healthcare by providing aggressive therapy in a luxurious and hotel-like environment. 

"If you had a grandmother, or perhaps a great aunt or uncle that your parents took you to visit in a nursing home back in the 1970s or 1980s, then perhaps your memory, like mine, is of an institutionalized setting with linoleum floors and cinder block walls. Or perhaps you have visited a nursing home within the past ten years and think of striped wallpaper and newer linoleum floors. If that has been your experience, then you’d be surprised by the welcoming décor and staff that you’d find when you walk into one of the facilities owned and operated by Lizer Jozefovic and his brother-in-law, Mark Neuman.
As the economy was taking a downward plunge in the mid 1980s, Lizer Jozefovic had a clothing business and was providing his demanding clientele with custom-made suits and exceptional customer service. By 1987, the slowdown made the business impractical and he knew it was time to look for a new career. In 1992, while working with seniors as a social worker’s assistant, he had what he calls “an epiphany.” In those days, once a person was admitted to a nursing home, the prevailing feeling was that it was the last stop before death. There was no going home. Jozefovic was working with a distinguished gentleman who turned to him and pleaded “I just want to go home.” Although Jozefovic tried to comfort and encourage his elderly patient, he knew that the gentleman would never go home again. He wished that he could do something to help him. That moment would have a big impact on the goals he set for his organizations once he became an administrator, and later the owner/operator of several facilities.
A year later, Jozefovic was able to combine his business acumen and experience working in nursing homes to acquire his first job as an Administrator, and in 1999, he and Neuman bought their first facility – Water’s Edge in Trenton, New Jersey. Since then, their portfolio has grown to include Skyview in Croton-on-Hudson, Middletown Park Manor in Orange County and Waterview Hills and Salem Hills in Purdys in Northern Westchester County. Today, the name of each facility is followed by “Rehabilitation & Healthcare,” because Lizer Jozefovic’s hope is that patients can be rehabilitated and that his facilities are a stop on their way back home."

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

		  		About Us
          

Epic Healthcare Management is a leading operator of rehabilitation and healthcare facilities dotting the East Coast from New York to Florida.
Intrinsic to each facility in the EPIC portfolio are the words “Rehabilitation & Healthcare”, as our overriding goal is to rehabilitate patients and successfully return them to their lives. That is why you will find 10-15 therapists at each facility – an integral factor in assuring we provide aggressive, proactive, targeted therapy. However, not every patient is capable of returning home. For those who have come to reside permanently, we aim to create the best possible environment while optimizing their quality of life.
We have left the institutional stereotype of a senior care residence far behind, transforming our facilities into luxury hotels. Gilt accented wallpaper, original oil paintings and jeweled sconces adorn the walls; hospital beds are accented by rich wooden headboards; elaborate drapery frame the windows; five-star menus are served in glamorous dining rooms; and staff members provide patients with concierge-like service.
