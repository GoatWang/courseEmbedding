The Team

Meet the brains behind the returns










Paul Woodward
CEO and Co-Founder

Paul brings expertise in macroeconomic analysis, from more than 10 years of study in the macroeconomic field, but more importantly, as CEO, Paul provides crucial leadership and vision to Cassini Capital Management.
Paul has established and maintained the long term vision for the firm. It was his vision that enabled the founding of Cassini, and his leadership that first attracted the talent of Brian Clark, then Boyd Lewis, and also an angel deal for operational funding. Before graduating from Michigan, Paul engaged Brian Clark, a longtime friend, in helping him find a distinctive edge in capital markets that they could use to build a specialized asset management firm. The results of that research eventually became Cassini Fund, LP. In the meantime, Paul sought business development experience in the financial services sector at both SunTrust Bank and Merrill Lynch. 
Prior to Cassini, Paul’s leadership was most visible during his time on the Michigan Men’s Gymnastics team where he not only captained the team, but was involved in the recruiting and training of key team members which enabled the program to win a BigTen title as well as second place at NCAA Championships his senior year. His recruits proceeded to win the NCAA title the year after he graduated.

Brian Clark
CIO and Co-Founder

Brian brings a unique set of analytical skills to Cassini developed over 20 years of solving highly complex problems as a software engineer. As CIO, Brian provides Cassini with the research and analytical tools necessary to perform in the volatility space at the highest level.
Brian has decades of system analysis experience obtained over a wide variety of technical software engineering projects ranging from the creation of highly customized accounting software to the awarding and payment processing of millions of hunting and fishing permits for multiple state governments. Brian also brings over ten years of business management experience from his time founding, growing and selling a successful business-to-business IT service company.
Brian’s analytical skill is supported by an intense passion for learning and self-education enforced by his youth spent home-schooling while training as an elite gymnast and former member of the US National Gymnastics Team. Brian’s passion for true understanding and independent thinking has translated from the world of business technology to finance, where he finds a much richer set of problems to pursue. It is this passion for exploration, learning and the practical implementation of true understanding that continually propels Cassini’s research and investment acumen forward.
