A Success Story Since 1863

For more than 150 years, one thing has remained the same -
our continued commitment to helping individuals and businesses on their path to success.















FIRST FINANCIAL BANK  HISTORY TIMELINE









1863
OUR BEGINNING

                                    The National Banking Act was passed by Congress and it paved the way for a more consistent National Banking System - even in the midst of the Civil War.
Our bank opened in Hamilton, Ohio, as First National Bank of Hamilton on August 15, 1863 with a strong commitment to putting our clients first and helping them achieve financial and life goals. The office was located in a room at 239 High Street. 
First National Bank of Hamilton is one of the first banks to organize under the new National Bank Act with Charter No. 56 – which gives us the distinction today as being the 6th oldest national bank in the United States.

A year later, the bank moved down the street to the Hamilton House block at the northwest corner of Second and High Streets in Hamilton. 
                                





1887
MOVING DAY

                                    We moved into the corner of this building at Third and High Streets in Hamilton.

This was our home for 36 years, until the building was razed in 1928 and operations moved temporarily to an office building on N. Third Street.















1923
FIRST NATIONAL BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF HAMILTON

                                    In May, the bank’s name was changed to The First National Bank and Trust Company of Hamilton when the Trust Division was created.

The trust department was established when federal banking laws were amended to permit banks to act as executors, receivers for insolvent business houses, managers of real estate and negotiators of securities. 












1930
PROUD TO SERVE HAMILTON

                                    August 30th is the day we opened our doors to clients at our new eight-story building on the corner of Third and High Streets in Hamilton. 

According to records, construction of the new building was completed at a “cost not to exceed $550,000.” 














1935
FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF HAMILTON BANKNOTES

                                    First National Bank of Hamilton issued its own currency in the form of national bank notes. 

These notes are still considered legal tender and the remaining bills are prized by collectors. A few are even on display at the bank!














1938
CELEBRATING 75 YEARS

                                    Happy 75th Birthday! 

We didn’t want to just celebrate our birthday, in honor of this milestone; we celebrated with others who were born in 1863.
















1963
CELEBRATING 100 YEARS 

                                    It’s the 100th anniversary of the passage of the National Bank Act and the 100th anniversary of the establishment of First National Bank of Hamilton. 

In honor of the yearlong celebration we offered to deposit $10 into a bank account to the first 100 babies born in Hamilton and Oxford hospitals. 














1980
FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF SOUTHWESTERN OHIO

                                    First National Bank of Southwestern Ohio was formed in July, by the consolidation of The First National Bank and Trust Company of Hamilton and First National Bank of Middletown.  

The merger combined the solid foundations both banks built from making numerous acquisitions of smaller financial institutions in Hamilton, Middletown, Monroe, Oxford and Seven Mile in Ohio.












1983
FIRST FINANCIAL BANCORP

                                    First Financial Bancorp, a holding company, was formed. First Financial Bancorp started as a $2.6 billion company with 15 affiliates operating 106 banking centers in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. 
















2000
 FIRST SOUTHWESTERN MERGES WITH HOME FEDERAL BANK

                                    First Southwestern continued to grow, expanding with several banks and offices in Camden, Lewisburg, Mason and Landen, operating full-service retail banking centers in Butler, Preble, Warren, and Hamilton counties as well as within local retirement communities. 

In July, First Southwestern merged operations with Home Federal Bank, a sister affiliate of First Financial Bancorp.

This merger solidified the market share First Southwestern enjoyed within many major cities of Butler County, Ohio.









2002
FIRST FINANCIAL BANCORP

                                    In July, a consolidation of First National Bank of Southwestern Ohio and Hebron Deposit Bank occurred.  
Hebron, again, was another sister affiliate of First Financial Bancorp. The merged entity became First Financial Bank, a regional bank serving Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky.  














2004
WELCOME, CLAUDE DAVIS

                                    Claude E. Davis is the new president and chief executive officer. 

Under his direction, a new era begins. After studying the company’s culture and history, in 2005, he introduced a new strategic plan outlining the bank’s mission, vision and growth strategy. 















2006
ANOTHER STEP ON THE PATH TO SUCCESS

                                    All regions are now unified under one name, First Financial Bank, with a new logo, a new client-centered brand and a new tagline of “another step on the path to success.” 

Along with new brand standards, First Financial adopted a consistent approach to products, facilities, and client service expectations.

As the company grew, a new market was established in Dayton, Ohio. At the end of 2006, assets were $3.3 billion. 











2007
WELCOME, TO OUR NEW BANKING CENTER

                                    A new banking center prototype is developed. This new banking center fully incorporates the new brand and client experience. 

Corporate headquarters were moved from Hamilton, Ohio to a new space just north of Downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.













2008
WELCOME, TO INDIANAPOLIS

                                    First Financial expands its footprint with the addition of Indianapolis, Indiana as a new market. 

The first prototype banking center opened in Crown Point, Indiana. 
 Also, as growth continues, a new banking center and office complex are opened in Kettering, Ohio.













2009
GROWTH CONTINUES

                                    More prototype banking centers are opened in Madeira and St. Marys, Ohio and Edgewood, Kentucky. 

Growth by acquisition added 30 more banking centers in our core operating markets of Greater Cincinnati and Central Indiana. 

Corporate headquarters relocated to a temporary space in Downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. 













2010
GROWTH CONTINUES

                                    The bank maintained high capital ratios that ranked among industry leaders. 

Plans were announced for a new regional hub in Columbus, Indiana. 

New prototype banking centers are opened in Shelbyville, Indiana and Indianapolis, Indiana.

Our business model is realigned from a regional approach to strategic business lines – commercial, retail/small business and wealth management. 












2011
NEW CORPORATE OFFICES OPEN

                                    Our Corporate Headquarters officially moved to 255 E. Fifth Street in Cincinnati, Ohio. The building is renamed First Financial Center. 

Our new Corporate Administration Center in Springdale, Ohio opened. This new office provides working space for 400 associates from various disciplines across our footprint.

New prototype banking centers opened in Lawrenceburg, Indiana and on the main floor inside our Corporate Administration Center. 

Acquisitions expanded our banking center presence in Greater Dayton, Ohio, Indianapolis, Indiana and other key areas in Indiana. 








2012
GOING MOBILE

                                    Clients can now enjoy banking on the go with the launch of our new mobile banking app and new money management tools including Ping Pay and Panorama.

Six new prototype banking centers opened in Anderson, Kenwood, Montgomery and downtown Cincinnati in Ohio, Hessville in NW Indiana and Columbus in southern Indiana. 

A new associate training and development center was also opened at our Downtown Hamilton, Ohio office.











2013
CELEBRATING 150 YEARS

                                    Happy 150th Birthday! 

It’s a year of celebration as we said, "Thank You", to our clients, associates, shareholders and the communities we serve.
As the 6th oldest national bank in the United States, we’re proud to serve our clients today and tomorrow, on their path to success.













2014
WELCOME, TO COLUMBUS

                                    Our footprint continued to expand into Central Ohio as a new market is established in Columbus. 
 Five banking centers are opened in Bexley, Westerville, Worthington, and Upper Arlington.















2015
25 YEARS OF SUCCESS

                                    At the end of the third quarter, First Financial hit a major milestone, 100 quarters, or 25 years, of consecutive profitability. It’s because of our clients, associates and community involvement and support that this was possible. 

Also, a new regional hub and downtown banking center opened in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The banking center is located on the first floor of the newly named First Financial Center at the Anthony Wayne Building, across the street from the historic Allen County Courthouse in Downtown Fort Wayne. In addition to the first-floor banking center, the sixth floor houses local leadership, commercial and mortgage teams. 

A new prototype banking center was also opened in Bloomington, Indiana and, the first prototype banking center opened in the Indianapolis, Indiana market in Avon.
