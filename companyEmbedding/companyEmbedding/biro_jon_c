Exterran Names Jon C. Biro as Chief Financial Officer






September 15, 2014 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Exterran Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EXH) today announced the appointment of 
      Jon C. Biro as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, 
      effective on Sept. 22, 2014. Biro most recently served as Executive Vice 
      President and Chief Financial Officer of Consolidated Graphics, Inc., an 
      international commercial printer previously listed on the New York Stock 
      Exchange, until its acquisition by R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company earlier 
      this year.
    


      Prior to joining Consolidated Graphics in 2008, Biro held several 
      executive positions with ICO, Inc., an international oilfield services 
      and specialty polymers business previously traded on Nasdaq. He was 
      Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of ICO from 2002 to 2008 and 
      served as its Interim Chief Executive Officer from July 2003 to February 
      2004. Biro was also a member of the ICO board of directors from 2003 to 
      2008.
    

      “Jon brings extensive experience as a public-company financial 
      executive,” said Brad Childers, Exterran’s President and Chief Executive 
      Officer, “and he is well positioned to help lead our efforts to drive 
      performance improvement, growth and shareholder value.”
    

      Prior to being named Chief Financial Officer of ICO, Inc., Biro served 
      as ICO’s Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer. 
      He began his career with ICO in 1994, as Controller. Prior to his 
      employment with ICO, Biro was employed by PriceWaterhouse Coopers LLP.
    

      “I’m excited to step into this role and look forward to working closely 
      with Exterran’s management team,” Biro said. “I am ready to continue the 
      company’s strong financial discipline and focus on delivering value to 
      our investors.”

Forward-Looking Statements


      All statements in this release (and oral statements made regarding the 
      subjects of this release) other than historical facts are 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the 
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking 
      statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and 
      are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are 
      outside Exterran Holdings’ control, which could cause actual results to 
      differ materially from such statements. Forward-looking information 
      includes, but is not limited to: Exterran Holdings’ financial and 
      operational strategies and ability to successfully effect those 
      strategies; Exterran Holdings’ expectations regarding future economic 
      and market conditions; Exterran Holdings’ financial and operational 
      outlook and ability to fulfill that outlook; and demand for Exterran 
      Holdings’ products and services and growth opportunities for those 
      products and services.
    

      While Exterran Holdings believes that the assumptions concerning future 
      events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties 
      in predicting certain important factors that could impact the future 
      performance or results of its business. Among the factors that could 
      cause results to differ materially from those indicated by such 
      forward-looking statements are: local, regional, national and 
      international economic conditions and the impact they may have on 
      Exterran Holdings and its customers; changes in tax laws that impact 
      master limited partnerships; conditions in the oil and gas industry, 
      including a sustained decrease in the level of supply or demand for oil 
      or natural gas or a sustained decrease in the price of oil or natural 
      gas; Exterran Holdings’ ability to timely and cost-effectively execute 
      larger projects; changes in political or economic conditions in key 
      operating markets, including international markets; any non-performance 
      by third parties of their contractual obligations; changes in safety, 
      health, environmental and other regulations; and the performance of 
      Exterran Partners.
    

      These forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, 
      forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in 
      Exterran Holdings’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
      December 31, 2013, and those set forth from time to time in Exterran 
      Holdings’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are 
      available at www.exterran.com. 
      Except as required by law, Exterran Holdings expressly disclaims any 
      intention or obligation to revise or update any forward-looking 
      statements whether as a result of new information, future events or 
      otherwise.
