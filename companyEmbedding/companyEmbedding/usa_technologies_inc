					Full Description



USA Technologies, Inc., incorporated on January 16, 1992, provides technology-enabled solutions and value-added services that facilitate electronic payment transactions within the unattended point of sale (POS) market. The Company is a provider in the small ticket, beverage and food vending industry and is also engaged in offering solutions and services to other unattended market segments, such as amusement, commercial laundry, kiosk and others. It has designed and marketed systems and solutions that facilitate electronic payment options, as well as telemetry and machine-to-machine (M2M) services, which include the ability to remotely monitor, control and report on the results of distributed assets containing its electronic payment solutions. The Company derives its revenues from license and transaction fees resulting from connections to, as well as services provided by, its ePort Connect service.As of June 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 429,000 connections to its ePort Connect service. The Company's customers range from global food service organizations to small businesses that operate in the self-serve, small ticket retail markets, including beverage and food vending, amusement and arcade machines, smartphones through its ePort Online solution, commercial laundry, tolls, and various other self-serve kiosk applications, as well as equipment developers or manufacturers incorporating the Company's ePort Connect service into their product offerings. The Company's solutions include the ePort Connect service, POS electronic payment devices, payment software able to process magnetic stripe credit and debit cards, contactless credit and debit cards, and near field communication (NFC) equipped mobile phones that allow consumers to make payments with their cell phones.The Company offers its customers various devices or software to connect their distributed assets. These range from QuickConnect Web service, and encrypted magnetic stripe card readers to its ePort hardware that can be attached to the door of a stand-alone terminal. The Company's network is designed to transmit payment information from its customers' terminals for processing and sales and diagnostic data for storage and reporting to customers. Also, the network, through server-based software applications, provides remote management information, and enables control of the networked device's functionality. Through its network, the Company has the ability to upload software and update devices remotely, such as change protocol functionality, provide software upgrades and change terminal display messages. The client devices are interconnected for the transfer of its customers' data through the Company's ePort Connect network that provides multiple connectivity options, such as phone line, Ethernet and wireless.The Company's ePort Connect solution provides customers with various services: POS options, which includes the ability to connect to a product line of cashless acceptance devices or software; Card Processing Services, which provides merchant account and terminal identification (ID) set up, pre-negotiated discounted fees on small ticket purchases, and direct electronic funds transfers (EFTs) to its customers' bank accounts for all settled card transactions, as well as compliance with processing regulations; Wireless connectivity, the Company manages the wireless account activation and distribution; Customer/Consumer Services, which includes providing help desk support, repairs and replacement of impaired system solutions; Online Sales Reporting, through the USALive online reporting system, which provides customers with a host of sales and operational data, including information regarding their credit and cash transactions, user configuration, reporting by machine and region, by date range and transaction type, data reports for operations and finance, graphical reporting of sales, and condition monitoring for equipment service, as well as activation of new devices and redeployments, and Deployment Planning, which enables access to services to help operators deploy cashless payment systems and integrated solutions. Its over-the-air update capabilities include automatic over-the-air updates to software, settings and features from its network to its ePort card reader.The Company offers M2M Telemetry and DEX data transfer, digital exchange (DEX), which communicates information, such as sales, cash in bill validators, coins in coin boxes, and sales of units by selection, pricing and door openings, among others. USA Technologies remotely transfers and pushes DEX data to customers' route management systems through its DEX partner program. Its value-added services enable access to additional services, such as MORE, the Company's loyalty program, two-tier pricing, special promotions, such as its Apple Pay mobile payment for vending customers, as well as a menu of hardware purchasing options, including JumpStart, the Company's terminal-included service option and hardware leasing options through third parties.The Company's device is ePort, which is used in self-service, unattended markets, such as vending, amusement and arcade, and various other kiosk applications. Its ePort product facilitates cashless payments by capturing payment information and transmitting it to the Company's network for authorization with the payment system. Additional capabilities of the Company's ePort includes control/access management by authorized users, collection of audit information (date and time of sale and sales amount), diagnostic information of the host equipment, and transmission of this data back to the Company's network for Web-based reporting, or to a compatible remote management system. Its ePort products are available in various modular configurations, and as hardware, software or as an application program interface (API) Web service.The Company's products include ePort Edge, which is a one-piece design and is intended for those customers requiring a magnetic swipe-only cashless system; ePort G-8, which is a two-piece design that supports magnetic stripe credit/debit cards and contactless cards, and the ePort G8 telemeter is also available as a stand-alone DEX telemetry solution; ePort G-9, which offers all the features of the G-8 plus additional new features that support expanded acceptance options, consumer engagement offerings and diagnostics, and QuickConnect, which is a Web service that allows a client application to interface with the Company's ePort Connect service. QuickConnect replaces ePort software development kit (SDK), which captured the Company's ePort technology in software form for personal computer (PC)-based devices, such as kiosks.The Company's other forms of ePort technology include eSuds, the Company's solution developed for the commercial laundry industry that enables laundry operators to provide customers cashless transactions through the use of their credit cards, debit cards and other payment mediums, such as student IDs, and ePort Online, which enables customers to use USALive to process cards for the purpose of online billing and recurring charges.The Company competes with Crane Payment Innovations and Cantaloupe Systems, Inc.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

USA Technologies Inc. is an American company known for its work with ePort cashless acceptance technology running on their patented ePort Connect service a PCI compliant, comprehensive suite of services designed specifically for the self serve, unattended market. ePort Connect wirelessly facilitates electronic payment options to consumers (so that payment can be made with credit, debit, or NFC enabled electronic wallets like Apple Pay and Android Pay) while providing operators with both telemetry and machine-to-machine (M2M) services. ePort technology is primarily found in vending machines, kiosks and point-of-sale (POS) terminals, but the ePort Online and ePort Mobile products have extended the network to accept recurring payments from a PC or retail outlets and the taxi industry through smartphone devices. The company also produced other technology to address needs within the unattended industry such as the More Prepaid and Loyalty consumer engage program, ePort beacon, facilitating Bluetooth payment options, and the EnergyMiser, a device that reduces the energy consumption of vending machines.[3][4][5][6]
History[edit]
USA Technologies was founded in 1992 and holds more than 87 patents on their products and services. USAT's patents pertain to all aspects of their industry, ranging from payment processing, transaction methods, and terminal connection methods, to energy management and telematics.[7] There currently are over 250,000 connections to its ePort Connect Service.[8] More recently, the company was named to Deloitte L.L.P’s 2014 Technology Fast 500 List of the fastest growing companies in North America.[9] they worked with Setomatic Systems to be the first to bring NFC technology in the Self Service Laundry market [10] The Nilson Report ranked USA Technologies 6th in US (and 28th Worldwide) in POS shipments [11] and they received the 2014 Frost and Sullivan North American Customer Value Leadership Award in Financial Services and Retail M2M Communications.[12]
In 2010, a proxy fight for the company's board of directors took place with shareholder group SAVE Partners.[13] This proxy fight ended with the addition of two SAVE Board candidates and modification of company policies.[14] In 2012, there was another proxy fight involving SAVE, but this dispute resulted in no change to the board.[15]
USA Technologies' CEO George Jensen resigned in October 2011 after he was revealed to be posting company information to an investor board.[2][16] Stephen Herbert was subsequently appointed as CEO and has been spearheading USA Technologies subsequent growth.[2][17]
Products[edit]
USA Technologies' primary product is the ePort, a cashless payment terminal for vending machines, kiosks, and POS terminals. The ePort EDGE accepts magnetic swipe cards, and the ePort G8 & G9 series also accept contactless cards, FOB, PIN, and virtual wallets such as Apple Pay and Softcard.[18][19][20][21][22][23]
In 2010, the ePort EDGE won the National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) award for innovation in cashless vending technology.[24][25][26] NAMA is the vending industry's national body.
Recently, the company was ranked once again among the leading shippers of point-of-sale terminals by The Nilson Report, a source of news and research on consumer payment systems worldwide. In 2013 the report ranked it 6th in POS shipments in the United States and 28th in the world.[11](In 2009, they ranked 6th in the US and 31st in the world) [27][28][29]
The company started[when?] the Business Express, an online business center service for hotels and convention centers.[30][31]

USA Technologies Inc. is an American company known for its work with ePort cashless acceptance technology running on their patented ePort Connect service a PCI compliant, comprehensive suite of services designed specifically for the self serve, unattended market. ePort Connect wirelessly facilitates electronic payment options to consumers (so that payment can be made with credit, debit, or NFC enabled electronic wallets like Apple Pay and Android Pay) while providing operators with both telemetry and machine-to-machine (M2M) services. ePort technology is primarily found in vending machines, kiosks and point-of-sale (POS) terminals, but the ePort Online and ePort Mobile products have extended the network to accept recurring payments from a PC or retail outlets and the taxi industry through smartphone devices. The company also produced other technology to address needs within the unattended industry such as the More Prepaid and Loyalty consumer engage program, ePort beacon, facilitating Bluetooth payment options, and the EnergyMiser, a device that reduces the energy consumption of vending machines.[3][4][5][6]
History[edit]
USA Technologies was founded in 1992 and holds more than 87 patents on their products and services. USAT's patents pertain to all aspects of their industry, ranging from payment processing, transaction methods, and terminal connection methods, to energy management and telematics.[7] There currently are over 250,000 connections to its ePort Connect Service.[8] More recently, the company was named to Deloitte L.L.P’s 2014 Technology Fast 500 List of the fastest growing companies in North America.[9] they worked with Setomatic Systems to be the first to bring NFC technology in the Self Service Laundry market [10] The Nilson Report ranked USA Technologies 6th in US (and 28th Worldwide) in POS shipments [11] and they received the 2014 Frost and Sullivan North American Customer Value Leadership Award in Financial Services and Retail M2M Communications.[12]
In 2010, a proxy fight for the company's board of directors took place with shareholder group SAVE Partners.[13] This proxy fight ended with the addition of two SAVE Board candidates and modification of company policies.[14] In 2012, there was another proxy fight involving SAVE, but this dispute resulted in no change to the board.[15]
USA Technologies' CEO George Jensen resigned in October 2011 after he was revealed to be posting company information to an investor board.[2][16] Stephen Herbert was subsequently appointed as CEO and has been spearheading USA Technologies subsequent growth.[2][17]
Products[edit]
USA Technologies' primary product is the ePort, a cashless payment terminal for vending machines, kiosks, and POS terminals. The ePort EDGE accepts magnetic swipe cards, and the ePort G8 & G9 series also accept contactless cards, FOB, PIN, and virtual wallets such as Apple Pay and Softcard.[18][19][20][21][22][23]
In 2010, the ePort EDGE won the National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) award for innovation in cashless vending technology.[24][25][26] NAMA is the vending industry's national body.
Recently, the company was ranked once again among the leading shippers of point-of-sale terminals by The Nilson Report, a source of news and research on consumer payment systems worldwide. In 2013 the report ranked it 6th in POS shipments in the United States and 28th in the world.[11](In 2009, they ranked 6th in the US and 31st in the world) [27][28][29]
The company started[when?] the Business Express, an online business center service for hotels and convention centers.[30][31]

As a leader in secure,unattended cashless transactions for the self-serve retail market, USAT provides the industry’s most comprehensive suite of services designed to connect your business to more sales, better operating data and stronger consumer relationships.
For over fifteen years, USAT has been helping customers in self-serve retail, traditionally cash-based industries, seamlessly make the transition to cashless payment and telemetry – and they are reaping the rewards of increased profits and happier customers. With the plethora of credit, debit, NFC and mobile payment options now available to consumers, our comprehensive portfolio of cashless payment, telemetry and consumer engagement services make the transition to cashless easy and ensure your customers never miss a sale due to missing change.
Cashless Technology and Value-Added Services
In addition to our broad line of ePort® cashless acceptance technology, USAT offers ePort Connect®, a PCI compliant, comprehensive suite of value-added services. Wirelessly facilitating electronic payment options, as well as telemetry and machine-to-machine (M2M) services, ePort Connect gives you the ability to remotely monitor, control and report on the results of your distributed assets – enabling greater operating efficiency for an improved bottom line.
End-to-End Connection – From Your Business to Your Consumer

USAT is shifting this paradigm through new customer engagement services. Our loyalty and prepaid program, MORE™, is helping customers establish meaningful connections with consumers in ways that build brand loyalty, create return customers and drive recurring sales.
Built on Proven Industry Expertise
Our ePort Connect customers benefit from more than 87 patents that have been granted on USAT's products and services. Our patents pertain to all aspects of our products and services, including payment processing, transaction methods, terminal connection methods, energy management and telematics.
Are you ready to cash in on the cashless revolution? Learn how you can do so effectively through USAT’s turnkey services and programs.
