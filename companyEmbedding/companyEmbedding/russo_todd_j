Russo, Todd, Assistant Principal




Welcome to Mr. Russo's Page
































Welcome to Lakeshore Where Learning Equals Success!

 

Assistant Principal: Todd Russo todd_russo@iss.k12.nc.us 
 

 




As the Assistant Principal at Lakeshore, I can assure you that we have a wonderful staff who are student centered and are extremely committed to meeting our students' needs. Our community and parent support is incredible, along with a caring and creative student population. If you are a returning family, we are exited to have you back at Lakeshore for another great year that will include engaging learning opportunities with a focus on STEAM. Problem Based Learning and STEAM activities will help prepare our learners for the careers of the future. If you are new to Lakeshore, please come in a visit and meet us. Your child's safety and creating a motivating environment is our first priority!
This is my thirteenth year in education with experience as a special education teacher, as a classroom teacher, behavioral interventionist, and as an instructional coach with knowledge of every grade level K-8. This is my fifth year as an Assistant Principal spending three years at elementary and one at middle. I currently reside in Statesville with my wife (Colleen), two children (Liliana and Tucker), our dog (Dozer) and our cat (Paisley).
