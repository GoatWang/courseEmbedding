        Better Buy: Under Armour Inc. vs. Skechers USA Inc.
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Brian Stoffel)

Five years ago, if anyone had suggested that Skechers (NYSE: SKX) was a better stock to buy than Under Armour (NYSE: UAA) (NYSE: UA), they would have been laughed out of the room. Skechers was settling an embarrassing lawsuit over its Shape-up shoes, while Under Armour was in the middle of an impressive run of quarters with comps growth of over 20%.But that was then, and this is now. Under attack from all sides, and dealing with some poor inventory decisions, Under Armour is operating in a very different climate. And that has led the two companies to very different results.On a split-adjusted basis, Under Armour stock sits around 66% higher today than it did five years ago, though its shares have declined nearly 60% from their 2015 highs. Skechers, on the other hand -- despite its own sharp rise and sharper tumble in 2015 -- has returned almost 300% over the past five years.
Image source: Getty ImagesDoes that mean that we should abandon Under Armour, or that it's stock is actually a great deal right now? Relative to an investment in Skechers, there's no way to know for sure. But there are three different lenses through which we can evaluate each company. Here's how they stack up.Sustainable competitive advantagesEvaluating a company's sustainable competitive advantage -- or "moat" -- is the most important thing any long-term investor can do when considering a stock. While the financial statements and valuation are important (more on those below), it is the moat that keeps customers coming back year after year, while holding the competition at bay.For both of these companies, brand is the most important moat. Competitors already make similar footwear and apparel, and the barriers to entry for new rivals aren't unreasonable, so a strong brand is one of the few things preventing their products from quickly becoming commoditized.Under Armour got its start by being the first national company to popularize wicking technology in athletic wear. It rode that success a long way and became one of the premier brands in America. While that momentum might have died down a bit, the brand is still very strong: Forbes recently ranked it as the fourth-most-valuable brand in sports, worth roughly $5.5 billion.Skechers, on the other hand, also has a strong brand. In fact, Brand Finance said that Skechers  was one of the fastest growing brands in America over the past few years. That growth, however, hasn't allowed it to eclipse Under Armour... yet. The brand was valued at $2.6 billion.Winner = Under ArmourFinancial FortitudeInvestors normally like to see companies do two things with their excess cash: plow it back into growth opportunities, or send to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks. Just letting a pile of money sit in the bank isn't very sexy.But there's something to be said for keeping a cash hoard in reserve. That's because every company eventually experiences difficult economic times. Those that enter such a period with lots of cash and little debt often emerge from them stronger: When your sector is getting punished, you can use your stockpile to buy back shares, acquire rivals on the cheap, or outspend the competition to gain long-term market share.If on the other hand, a company is cash poor and debt heavy, it's fragile -- even minor issues can leave it staring down the prospect of bankruptcy. Keeping in mind that Under Armour's market cap is almost twice the size of Skechers', here's how the two stack up.CompanyCashDebtNet IncomeFree Cash FlowUnder Armour$172 million$784 million$176 million$25 millionSkechers$607 million$68 million$240 million$196 millionData source: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance, Unilever IR. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing twelve-month basis.
Without a doubt, Under Armour is far more financially vulnerable. It has a massive debt load relative to its cash, especially when compared to Skechers, and is bringing in less profit and free cash flow.If an economic crisis hit now, it could prove to be a fatal blow for Under Armour.Winner = SkechersValuationFinally, we have the murky science of valuation. While there's no single metric that can tell you definitively if a stock is cheap or expensive, there are a number of ratios investors commonly consult. Here are three that I like to use.
CompanyP/EP/FCFPEG RatioUnder Armour433308.9Skechers19231.6Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E calculated using non-GAAP earnings when possible. N/A = Not ApplicableOnce again, we have a clear winner: Despite Under Armour's steep stock decline over the past two years, it remains very expensive by all three of these metrics. In fact, even after factoring in forecast growth (PEG Ratio), it appears to be trading for a more than 400% premium to Skechers.Winner = SkechersMy winner is...So there you have it: Skechers -- which was surprisingly the better buy five years ago -- remains the better buy today. While Under Armour has the wider moat -- based on the strength of its brand -- Skechers is closing the gap fast. And when it comes to financial fortitude and valuation, Skechers clearly offers investors a more favorable chance for profit.10 stocks we like better than SkechersWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        Better Buy: Under Armour Inc. vs. Skechers USA Inc.
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Brian Stoffel)

            Jul 21, 2017
        Updated Jul 21, 2017





























































































Five years ago, if anyone had suggested that Skechers (NYSE: SKX) was a better stock to buy than Under Armour (NYSE: UAA) (NYSE: UA), they would have been laughed out of the room. Skechers was settling an embarrassing lawsuit over its Shape-up shoes, while Under Armour was in the middle of an impressive run of quarters with comps growth of over 20%.But that was then, and this is now. Under attack from all sides, and dealing with some poor inventory decisions, Under Armour is operating in a very different climate. And that has led the two companies to very different results.On a split-adjusted basis, Under Armour stock sits around 66% higher today than it did five years ago, though its shares have declined nearly 60% from their 2015 highs. Skechers, on the other hand -- despite its own sharp rise and sharper tumble in 2015 -- has returned almost 300% over the past five years.
Image source: Getty ImagesDoes that mean that we should abandon Under Armour, or that it's stock is actually a great deal right now? Relative to an investment in Skechers, there's no way to know for sure. But there are three different lenses through which we can evaluate each company. Here's how they stack up.Sustainable competitive advantagesEvaluating a company's sustainable competitive advantage -- or "moat" -- is the most important thing any long-term investor can do when considering a stock. While the financial statements and valuation are important (more on those below), it is the moat that keeps customers coming back year after year, while holding the competition at bay.For both of these companies, brand is the most important moat. Competitors already make similar footwear and apparel, and the barriers to entry for new rivals aren't unreasonable, so a strong brand is one of the few things preventing their products from quickly becoming commoditized.Under Armour got its start by being the first national company to popularize wicking technology in athletic wear. It rode that success a long way and became one of the premier brands in America. While that momentum might have died down a bit, the brand is still very strong: Forbes recently ranked it as the fourth-most-valuable brand in sports, worth roughly $5.5 billion.Skechers, on the other hand, also has a strong brand. In fact, Brand Finance said that Skechers  was one of the fastest growing brands in America over the past few years. That growth, however, hasn't allowed it to eclipse Under Armour... yet. The brand was valued at $2.6 billion.Winner = Under ArmourFinancial FortitudeInvestors normally like to see companies do two things with their excess cash: plow it back into growth opportunities, or send to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks. Just letting a pile of money sit in the bank isn't very sexy.But there's something to be said for keeping a cash hoard in reserve. That's because every company eventually experiences difficult economic times. Those that enter such a period with lots of cash and little debt often emerge from them stronger: When your sector is getting punished, you can use your stockpile to buy back shares, acquire rivals on the cheap, or outspend the competition to gain long-term market share.If on the other hand, a company is cash poor and debt heavy, it's fragile -- even minor issues can leave it staring down the prospect of bankruptcy. Keeping in mind that Under Armour's market cap is almost twice the size of Skechers', here's how the two stack up.CompanyCashDebtNet IncomeFree Cash FlowUnder Armour$172 million$784 million$176 million$25 millionSkechers$607 million$68 million$240 million$196 millionData source: SEC filings, Yahoo! Finance, Unilever IR. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing twelve-month basis.
Without a doubt, Under Armour is far more financially vulnerable. It has a massive debt load relative to its cash, especially when compared to Skechers, and is bringing in less profit and free cash flow.If an economic crisis hit now, it could prove to be a fatal blow for Under Armour.Winner = SkechersValuationFinally, we have the murky science of valuation. While there's no single metric that can tell you definitively if a stock is cheap or expensive, there are a number of ratios investors commonly consult. Here are three that I like to use.
CompanyP/EP/FCFPEG RatioUnder Armour433308.9Skechers19231.6Data source: Yahoo! Finance, E*Trade. P/E calculated using non-GAAP earnings when possible. N/A = Not ApplicableOnce again, we have a clear winner: Despite Under Armour's steep stock decline over the past two years, it remains very expensive by all three of these metrics. In fact, even after factoring in forecast growth (PEG Ratio), it appears to be trading for a more than 400% premium to Skechers.Winner = SkechersMy winner is...So there you have it: Skechers -- which was surprisingly the better buy five years ago -- remains the better buy today. While Under Armour has the wider moat -- based on the strength of its brand -- Skechers is closing the gap fast. And when it comes to financial fortitude and valuation, Skechers clearly offers investors a more favorable chance for profit.10 stocks we like better than SkechersWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Skechers wasn't one of them!

Skechers USA Inc.: SKECHERS Announces Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results and Record Net Sales


Tickers:
                    SKX 




Record Second Quarter Net Sales of $1.026 Billion
Record First Six Months Net Sales of $2.099 Billion

Top Company Interviews


        MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 20, 2017-- SKECHERS USA, Inc. (NYSE:SKX), a global footwear leader, today announced financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017.
      
      
        Second Quarter and Six Month 2017 Highlights


Record second quarter net sales of $1.026 billion, an increase of 16.9 percent


Record six month net sales of $2.099 billion, an increase of 13.0 percent


Gross margins of 47.6 percent for the second quarter and 46.0 percent for the six months


      
        'Second quarter net sales exceeded our expectations setting another record quarter, and making the first half of 2017 a new record with sales surpassing $2 billion,' began David Weinberg, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. 'The growth came across our three distribution channels-with double-digit increases in our Company-owned global Skechers retail business, and each of our international distributor, subsidiary and joint venture businesses, as well as a mid-single-digit increase in our domestic wholesale business. Further, in the second quarter of 2017 in our domestic wholesale business, we shipped 11.4 percent more pairs while our average price per pair decreased 4.5 percent.'
      
      
        Second Quarter Financial Results
      
      
        Quarterly net sales increased 16.9 percent to $1.026 billion compared to the second quarter 2016. The growth was the result of a 6.4 percent increase in the Company's domestic wholesale business, an 18.6 percent increase in the Company's international wholesale business, and a 28.0 percent increase in its Company-owned global retail business, which included comparable same store sales increases of 7.1 percent.
      
      
        Gross profit for the second quarter was $488.3 million, or 47.6 percent of net sales, compared to $416.3 million, or 47.4 percent of net sales, for the second quarter of last year.
      
      
        Second quarter selling expenses increased $24.0 million to $100.0 million, or 9.7 percent of sales, compared to $76.0 million, or 8.7 percent of sales, in the second quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased domestic advertising of $5.2 million, additional international advertising expenses of $6.4 million, primarily to support the growth in its European subsidiaries as well as increases in Japan and South Korea, and an additional $4.2 million in selling commissions from its joint venture in South Korea.
      
      
        General and administrativeexpenses for the second quarter increased $62.1 million to $305.3 million, or 29.8 percent of sales, compared to $243.2 million, or 27.7 percent of sales, in the second quarter of the prior year. The year-over-year quarterly increase was primarily due to Skechers' focus on long-term global growth, including $22.3 million associated with the Company's 68 additional domestic and international retail stores-31 of which were opened in the second quarter, and $26.2 million to support its international growth, of which $16.9 million was due to increased costs in China, $3.6 million for the transition of its South Korean distributor to a joint venture, and $2.4 million in Japan. Domestic wholesale general and administrative expenses in the second quarter increased $13.5 million year-over-year primarily due to increased headcount in the United States to support its brand worldwide, as well as the expansion into new categories and brands.
      
      
        Mr. Weinberg added: 'Investing in our brand and business is critical for both our short-term and long-term growth initiatives. This is evident in both the expansion of our Company-owned global retail business, which had the highest net sales dollar and percentage gain, followed by our international wholesale business. Given the increases in our international business, which for the first six months represented 48 percent of our total business, we believe the greatest opportunity for expansion is internationally, and we are investing in our infrastructure and marketing to support this progress.'
      
      
        Earnings from operations were $86.3 million or 8.4 percent of sales, a decrease of 14.0 percent over the second quarter of 2016.
      
      
        Net earnings decreased 19.7 percent to $59.5 million, and diluted net earnings per share were $0.38. The Company's quarterly effective tax rate in the second quarter was 16.1 percent compared to 12.7 percent over the second quarter of 2016. The Company expects its effective tax rate to be between 14 percent and 19 percent for fiscal 2017.
      
      
        Six Month Financial Results
      
      
        Net sales were $2.099 billion, gross profit was $964.8 million or 46.0 percent of net sales, and earnings from operations were $210.7 million or 10.0 percent of net sales. Net earnings were $153.5 million and diluted net earnings per share were $0.98 per share.
      
      
        Robert Greenberg, SKECHERS chief executive officer, commented: 'Twenty-five years ago in May, we founded Skechers with a single line of men's bootsavailable in the United States. Within a year, we were shipping to several international markets, and planning expansion into women's and kids. We've come a very long way in a relatively short period of time-including our present position in the United States as the leader in walking, work, casual and comfort footwear, and second in all of footwear combined, and a leading brand in numerous countries around the world. Our domestic and international growth in the quarter and in recent years was the result of our continued focus on developing innovative, comfortable and stylish footwear; determination to build the brand through marketing; investment in operations and logistics for the present and future; and the dedication of our highly talented and creative team.'
      
      
        Mr. Greenberg continued: 'Domestically in the second quarter, we introduced a key new product, You by Skechers, delivered more of our heritage footwear collections, experienced strong sales in our sandal business, and saw continued strength in our kids' lighted footwear. In the international markets, we achieved double-digit growth in many countries worldwide-including Germany, Chile, India, China, and Australia.Along with delivering strong product for men, women and kids to our wholesale partners, our international success was due to the expansion of Skechers retail stores around the world, which now includes 1,870 international stores of which 1,691 are third-party-owned locations. At quarter end, our total Skechers retail store count was 2,305, and included the opening of several key locations-Tokyo's popular Shibuya district, the new Century City Mall in Los Angeles, a super store in Ontario Mills in Southern California, a store in New York's SoHo, among others-and the relocation of our store on San Francisco's Powell Street, which now has a much larger sales floor and better visibility. Based on our global meetings in May and June, and our on-going domestic key account meetings at our corporate offices, plus our July sell-throughs,we believe that the record sales we experienced in the first six months will continue in the second half.'
      
      
        Balance Sheet
      
      
        At June 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents was $751.6 million, an increase of $122.8 million, or 19.5 percent over June 30, 2016.
      
      
        Total inventory, including inventory in transit, was $669.7 million, an increase of $79.0 million or 13.4 percent over June 30, 2016, and a decrease of $30.8 million or 4.4 percent over December 31, 2016. The increase over last year was primarily due to the Company's growth worldwide and is in line with the Company's backlogs, and growing retail and international wholesale business.
      
      
        Working capital was $1.359 billion at June 30, 2017 versus $1.155 billion at June 30, 2016.
      
      
        Mr. Weinberg continued: 'We ended the quarter with our three business channels showing continued growth, and low double-digit increases in backlog on a worldwide basis. With the investments we have made in our business globally, and our strong cash and inventory position as well as new product initiatives we are delivering, we believe we are well positioned for continued growth in the second half, and in the coming year.'
      
      
        Outlook
      
      
        Based on these key indicators, the Company believes it will achieve net sales in the third quarter in the range of $1.050 billion to $1.075 billion, which would represent a third quarter sales record, and earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.47. This projection includes flat sales increases in the Company's domestic wholesale business, and double-digit increases in its international wholesale business, and its global Company-owned retail stores.
      
      
        The Company expects its capital expenditures for the remainder of 2017 to be approximately $35.0 million to $40.0 million, which includes corporate office upgrades and an additional 35 to 40 Company-owned retail store openings and several store remodels.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
