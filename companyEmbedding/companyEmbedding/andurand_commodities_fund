Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

Source: Bloomberg. Data from 10/1/2010 – 6/30/2017. October 1, 2010 is the inception of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index. Index returns and correlations are historical and are not representative of any fund performance. Total returns of the index include reinvested dividends. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  One cannot invest directly in an index. The indexes are composite indexes of commodity sector returns representing unmanaged, unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that are broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. 

S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities;
Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.26% for DXCTX, 2.01% for DXSCX, and 1.01% for DXCIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund.

If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF | Direxion


























 






























The Easier, More Adaptive Way to Diversify with Commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
Long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.
Introducing The Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF
The Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF (Ticker: COM) allows investors to take advantage of rising commodity prices, in addition to mitigate risk by going flat (cash) when individual commodities are experiencing downward trends. It seeks to potentially provide commodity investment returns with lower risk characteristics than long-only commodity strategies.
The fund seeks to provide total return that exceeds that of the Auspice Broad Commodity Index over a complete market cycle. There is no guarantee the fund will meet its stated investment objectives.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.70%. The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”), has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.70% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following: taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at www.direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

Chance oil could drop to $30: Hedge fund manager
CNN 12 Nov 2015 (VIDEO)





Andurand oil hedge fund keeps bet on lower prices
FT 1 September 2015


 
	 
										Pierre Andurand, the hedge fund manager who returned 51 per cent before fees last year by betting against the oil price, told the Financial Times that the market had overreacted to signs of slowing US crude production and comments by Opec. He believes prices will head lower again, possibly dropping below $30 a barrel.
                                    
New Money Masters
Forbes 17 June 2015


 Cred: Since 2008 has posted annualized net returns of 36% across his BlueGold and Andurand hedge funds; predicted last year’s drop in oil.
										
										
										Pay-It-Forward Wisdom: Live to fight another day. Citing hedge fund giants George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, Andurand says the key to trading, particularly in fast-moving commodities, is to size trades correctly. “To make as much as possible when we are right and lose as little as possible when we are wrong–because we are always going to be wrong sometimes,” he says.
										[...]
										
										Best Idea: Don’t bet on a quick comeback for oil prices. “It will take a few years before we have another bull rally, unless there is a large supply disruption in the Middle East,” says Andurand, who thinks oil will trade in the $40-$75 range for the next two years.
                                    
Pierre Andurand – Energy trader extraordinaire
HedgeFund Journal 15 May 2015 [Download]



										Pierre Andurand’s track record makes his strategy one of the top performers in any category – and not only within the commodities space. Stitch together the BlueGold (+241% cumulative) and Andurand Capital (+105% cumulative) track records and you arrive at annualised returns of 35.7% and total returns of 600% between February 2008 and March 2015. These returns have actually been achieved by those BlueGold investors that took the opportunity to carry forward their individual high-water marks from BlueGold to Andurand Capital, which has now fully recovered Andurand’s only losing year in eleven, 2011, and made new highs. (If the clock starts in September 2004 with his proprietary trading track record from Vitol (+380% cumulative) then total returns compound up to more than 3,200%, though no external investor has received this; data is not disclosed for his earlier proprietary trading at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America). These annualised returns in the thirties are in the same league as legends such as George Soros or Stanley Druckenmiller in their heydeys. 
										

                                    
Oil Trader Andurand Sees U.S., OPEC Supply Capping Prices 
Bloomberg 14 May 2015 (VIDEO)


Oil supply from both OPEC and U.S. shale drillers is set to expand later this year, preventing further gains in prices, according to hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand.

										Oil prices will remain “relatively low” for the next two years as a rebound in recent months allows U.S. producers to revive slowing output, said Andurand, who generated a 38 percent return in 2014 from wagering that oil would fall. At the same time, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are raising their production amid concerns demand is nearing its peak, he said.

                                    
Andurand wins big in volatile oil markets with a well-timed directional short play
Eurohedge 24 April 2015

Andurand Capital, the discretionary commodity trading firm led by high-profile ex-BlueGold and Vitol man Pierre Andurand, is on a roll right now after correctly positioning its portfolio to profit from the late-2014 tumble in the oil price that caught many other investors off-guard
										 
										Pierre Andurand Recent months have seen a dramatic fall in the price of oil following a prolonged bull run – a downturn that was both rapid and, for many traders and investors, unexpected.
										While many market participants including hedge funds were wrong-footed to their cost, well-known and experienced oil trader Pierre Andurand had positioned his two-year-old Andurand Commodities Fund specifically to exploit the price fall.

										Andurand’s shrewd assessment of the oil markets, and his judgement that the market was oversupplied while demand had cooled, led him to short crude oil in September – and resulted in an impressive 2014 gain of 38.10%, all of it made in the last three months of the year.

Andurand Hedge Fund Said to Gain 38% Last Year on Oil Slide Bet
Bloomberg 06 January 2015



										Pierre Andurand’s energy hedge fund returned 38 percent after performance fees in 2014, boosted by its bet on the slump in Brent crude oil, according to a person with knowledge of the performance.
										
										Andurand Capital Management followed its 18 percent gain in November with a 15 percent December increase, said the person, who asked not to be named because the returns aren’t public. Investors in the London-based fund, which manages $400 million, were informed of the performance yesterday, the person said.
										
										In a Dec. 1 interview with Bloomberg News, Andurand predicted Brent crude would decline to $60 a barrel by the end of 2014 and reach $50 early in 2015. The price dropped below $52 today and ended last year at $57.33.


                                    
Andurand Hedge Fund Said to Gain 38% Last Year on Oil Slide Bet
Reuters 3 December 2014


(Reuters) - Oil prices are set for wild swings after OPEC's decision to let the market find its level, says the hedge fund manager famous for calling the 2008 oil price spike and crash, adding that U.S. producers are set to feel pain.
										
										"The fact Saudi is not going to be the marginal producer means more volatility," Andurand, of London-based Andurand Capital Management, said. "And that means bigger moves for traders to take advantage of."
                                    
Oil fund manager Andurand sees big price swings after OPEC decision
Bloomberg 11 November 2014


Pierre Andurand, the oil trader who predicted the top of the market in 2008 and the plunge last month, expects prices to drop about 18 percent over the next six months.
Andurand sees Brent crude declining to $65 to $70 a barrel, according to a Nov. 11 investor letter. He’s betting Iran will increase production after reaching agreement with the U.S. and European Union over sanctions tied to its nuclear program, and that a Nov. 27 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that will decide whether to reduce production won’t go far enough.
                                    
Some Hedge Funds Profit From Steep Decline in Oil Prices   
WSJ 4 November 2014



										 Mr. Andurand shorted oil in early October, as it became clear to him that Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude-oil exporter, was unlikely to cut output sharply to shore up prices.
										
										“Over my career I’ve been long more than I’ve been short, but that’s because we’ve been in a market that’s going up,” Mr. Andurand said, referring to bets on both rising and falling oil prices. “You have to be agnostic. I try not to be limited by any long-term view. The market has changed.”
									

Reuters/CNBC 29 October 2014


(Reuters) - Pierre Andurand, one of the most respected and successful fund managers in the oil industry, said he believed U.S. light crude oil could fall as low as $50 per barrel.
										
										The U.S. benchmark oil price, also known as WTI, "will be volatile, but assuming no more supply disruptions, I think we can overshoot down to $50 a barrel," Andurand told Reuters on the sidelines of the Oil & Money conference on Wednesday.
										"The move will mainly be in the front of the curve, but not just the first three months - the first six months or so," he said, adding that Brent would come down as well.
										[..]
										
										Andurand told the Oil and Money conference that he thought it unlikely that OPEC would cut production, even though current supply and demand trends suggested the market could be in a 2 million barrel-per-day surplus next year.
										"OPEC, which is really Saudi, Kuwait, UAE, could take the heat between them and cut 2 million bpd next year, then another 1 million next year, then another 1 million 12 months after that," he said.
										
										"But if they did that, prices would rise and U.S. output would keep growing and we'd keep seeing large efficiency gains ... U.S. production growth has to slow down, otherwise there will need to be more supply disruptions in large producing countries."
										He added, "Supply growth has been higher than expected ... The period of stable oil prices we've had over the last three or so years has really been by chance, with supply disruptions masking this shale oil production."
										
										"We are going to be in a bear market ... I think we go lower before we go higher." He declined to say whether his fund was currently shorting the oil market.

BlueGold closes and returns funds to investors 
Telegraph 5 April 2012


The $1bn (£650m) fund, founded by oil trading stars Pierre Andurand and Dennis Crema, has written to clients to tell them it is liquidating the entire portfolio and undertaking an “orderly closure”. Investors will receive about 98pc of their capital, the letter said, without giving a reason for the decision.
											
											Like many energy specialist hedge funds, BlueGold has been struggling lately. The sharp oil price spike since the start of March caught many off guard, and that followed a difficult 2011.
											BlueGold, which built its reputation on outperformance, is thought to have seen the value of its portfolio drop by 2pc in the first two months of the year, on top of a decline of more than a third in 2011. By contrast, Brent crude prices are up about 15pc this year.
											Investors had previously enjoyed strong returns. In 2008, the year BlueGold was established, it delivered 209pc. The following year it bucked the downturn again with a 55pc return and in 2010 it produced 13pc. At the fund’s peak, it had $2.4bn under management.

BlueGold coins it
FT Alphaville 13 January 2009


It is always hard to be sure who has the best-performing hedge fund, but London’s BlueGold looks like it could be the winner for last year.

										With a rise of 210 per cent, tripling investors’ money, the oil and commodities specialist set up in February soared ahead of rivals – most of whom lost money.

										BlueGold was set up by Dennis Crema and Pierre Andurand, former oil traders who successfully rode the oil boom of the first half of the year and then timed the bust almost perfectly. [...]

									
BlueGold swims against the tide
The Times 31 December 2008


[...]On average, hedge funds turned in a loss of 18 per cent during the first 11 months of 2008, making it the worst-ever year for the sector.
										Yet there are exceptions to the rule, as proved by Dennis Crema and Pierre Andurand, the co-founders of BlueGold Capital Management.
										The pair, both former traders at Vitol, the Swiss energy trading firm, launched their fund on February 1 this year and, so far, have produced a 200 per cent return for investors. Essentially, the pair were aggressively long of crude oil until the middle of the year, before aggressively going short about the time crude prices topped out at $147 a barrel.
										According to Mr Crema, the strategy was simple, concentrating on an analysis of data from OECD countries for clues on future oil demand. When the data started to point to a downturn in demand, BlueGold went short.

                Noted hedge fund liquidated final bullish positions in April
            



                Brent crude prices fell sharply in late May after OPEC meeting
            



Pierre Andurand’s oil hedge fund lost 17.3 percent in the year through May as one of the world’s most prominent energy bulls suffered in the wake of last month’s OPEC meeting, according to a document outlining the fund’s performance.Pierre AndurandPhotographer: Anthony Harvey/Getty Images for The New York TimesLondon-based Andurand Capital Management LLP deepened its annual losses despite having sold its last bullish -- or long -- positions at the end of April, when the fund was already down 15.4 percent.Andurand, who’s made a name by calling past rises and falls in the market, had been reducing his bullish positions over the course of 2017. Despite the liquidation, the oil trader remains optimistic about fundamentals of the market.








Oil prices fell sharply in late May after OPEC and several non-OPEC countries agreed to extend their production cuts by nine months until the end of March 2018, disappointing investors who hoped for deeper as well as longer output curbs. From May 25 to June 1, the price of Brent crude fell $3.65 a barrel -- a drop of almost 7 percent.The oil investor, whose fund gained 22 percent last year net of fees, manages about $1.3 billion, making it one of the largest commodities-focused hedge funds. Its peers include Astenbeck Capital Management, with $2.65 billion in assets, Cumulus Fund, with $1.9 billion, and Blenheim Capital Management LLC with $1.5 billion.A spokesman for Andurand Capital Management LLP declined to comment.

                Saudi cuts, declining U.S. fuel stocks among bullish signs
            



                His fund has lost 12% through March as crude rally falters
            



Oil’s jerky path to recovery has been a frustrating, money-losing affair for hedge fund trader Pierre Andurand this year, but he’s sticking to his view that the commodity is set to rebound.Even after his Andurand Commodities Fund lost about 12 percent through March as oil prices linger around $50 a barrel, he’s still betting that slowing Middle East production and declining U.S. fuel inventories show prices are headed higher, according to a letter to investors obtained by Bloomberg News.“While the price action year-to-date has proven to be extremely frustrating, our bullish outlook for oil prices has not changed," Andurand wrote. “We maintain the view that front month oil prices will reach new highs over the next few months as fundamentals improve considerably going into the summer."

Andurand’s $1.4 billion fund grew 22 percent last year as he successfully predicted both the early slide in prices and crude’s subsequent recovery. This year, crude has been “stuck in a trendless and choppy market" amid concerns about rising U.S. supplies, he said in the letter. Still, he pointed to Saudi Arabia’s output cuts, a fall in crude stored offshore of Iran and declines to stockpiles of U.S. refined products as signs that prices will soon rise.Oil rebounded on Tuesday after falling six days amid projections that U.S. crude inventories dropped for a third week.Surging U.S. shale drilling may add 800,000 barrels a day of production this year, but that will be outstripped by rising demand and declines elsewhere in the world, Andurand said.“U.S. shale production would have to grow more for the market to offset demand growth and continuous supply declines," he wrote. Such a ramp-up “will not happen without a sharp escalation in costs and therefore higher oil prices. Service costs have already been ratcheting up over the last six months. We expect cost inflation to continue and intensify."

Taylor Woods, Andurand Shine As Commodity Funds Suffer
Nov 22 2013  |  12:04pm ET

This year will not be a lost one for all commodity hedge funds.
While most managers in the space are suffering losses amidst a double-digit stock-market rally, Taylor Woods Capital Management can boast of a double-digit return of its own. The $860 million fund is up 18% through October, Bloomberg News reports, on track to post the best—indeed, first positive—year of its three-year life.
Greenwich, Conn.-based Taylor Woods was set up by former Credit Suisse star trader George Taylor and Trevor Woods, and lost 5% in its first year and 2.3% last year.
Doing even better is Andurand Capital Management, the energy hedge fund set up in February by BlueGold Capital Management founder Pierre Andurand. That fund is up 27% in its first year, in spite of a 5.8% drop in October.
Also in the black in 2013 is Jamison Capital Partners' Koppenberg Macro Commodity Fund, which is up about 6%, according to Bloomberg. That fund has $1.5 billion in assets.
Others have not been as good or lucky: Frere Hall Capital Management was bludgeoned in October, losing 22% to wipe out its small 1.2% gain through September. The fund has $646 million in assets.

 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.

Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

Source: Bloomberg. Data from 10/1/2010 – 6/30/2017. October 1, 2010 is the inception of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index. Index returns and correlations are historical and are not representative of any fund performance. Total returns of the index include reinvested dividends. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  One cannot invest directly in an index. The indexes are composite indexes of commodity sector returns representing unmanaged, unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that are broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. 

S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities;
Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.26% for DXCTX, 2.01% for DXSCX, and 1.01% for DXCIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.

Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF | Direxion


























 






























The Easier, More Adaptive Way to Diversify with Commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
Long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.
Introducing The Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF
The Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF (Ticker: COM) allows investors to take advantage of rising commodity prices, in addition to mitigate risk by going flat (cash) when individual commodities are experiencing downward trends. It seeks to potentially provide commodity investment returns with lower risk characteristics than long-only commodity strategies.
The fund seeks to provide total return that exceeds that of the Auspice Broad Commodity Index over a complete market cycle. There is no guarantee the fund will meet its stated investment objectives.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.70%. The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”), has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.70% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following: taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at www.direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.
