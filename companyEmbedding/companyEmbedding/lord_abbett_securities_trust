The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown at net asset value have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

Description[edit]
Lord Abbett is a privately owned, limited liability company with 64 active partners (as of March 31, 2017). Managing Partner Daria L. Foster leads the firm and is responsible for setting strategic direction and business management. Robert A. Lee, Partner and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for directing the portfolio management, research, and trading activities for the firm’s equity and fixed-income strategies. Lee assumed the role of CIO on July 1, 2016, after former CIO Robert I. Gerber retired. [2]
The firm focuses solely on actively managed investment portfolios. Lord Abbett’s strategies are available within separate and sub-advised accounts, commingled and mutual funds, and managed account platforms.[3][4]
History[edit]
On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord and his associates created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]

Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]

The section of each Fund’s statement of additional information titled “Purchases, Redemptions, Pricing, and Payments to Dealers – Revenue Sharing and Other Payments to Dealers and Financial Intermediaries” is supplemented with the following:
 
In addition to the various sales commissions, concessions and 12b-1 fees described above, Lord Abbett, Lord Abbett Distributor and the Fund may make other payments to dealers and other firms authorized to accept orders for Fund shares (collectively, “Dealers”).
 
Lord Abbett or Lord Abbett Distributor makes payments to Dealers in its sole discretion, at its own expense and out of its own resources (including revenues from advisory fees and 12b-1 fees) and without additional cost to the Fund or the Fund’s shareholders.  This compensation from Lord Abbett is not reflected in the fees and expenses listed above in the Fee Table section of this Prospectus.  The payments may be for activities including but not limited to the following:
 
· marketing and/or distribution support for Dealers;
 
· the Dealers’ and their investment professionals’ shareholder servicing efforts;
 
· training and education activities for the Dealers, their investment professionals and/or their clients or potential clients;
 
· certain information regarding Dealers and their investment professionals;
 
· sponsoring or otherwise bearing, in part or in whole, the costs for other meetings of Dealers’ investment professionals and/or their clients or potential clients;
 
· the purchase of products or services from the Dealers, such as investment research, software tools or data for investment analysis purposes;
 
· certain Dealers’ costs associated with orders relating to Fund shares (“ticket charges”); and/or
 
· any other permissible activity that Lord Abbett or Lord Abbett Distributor, in its sole discretion, believes would facilitate sales of Fund shares.
 
Some of these payments are sometimes called “revenue sharing” payments.  Most of these payments are intended to reimburse Dealers directly or indirectly for the costs they or their investment professionals incur in connection with educational seminars and training efforts about the Lord Abbett Funds to enable the Dealers and their investment professionals to make recommendations and provide services that are suitable and useful in meeting shareholder needs, as well as to maintain the necessary infrastructure to make the Lord Abbett Funds available to shareholders.  The costs and expenses related to these efforts may include travel, lodging, entertainment and meals, among other things. In addition, Lord Abbett Distributor may, for specified periods of time, decide to forgo the portion of front-end sales charges to which it normally is entitled and allow Dealers to retain the full sales charge for sales of Fund shares.  In some instances, these temporary arrangements will be offered only to certain Dealers expected to sell significant amounts of Fund shares.
 
2




 
Lord Abbett or Lord Abbett Distributor may benefit from revenue sharing if the Dealer features the Fund in its sales system (such as by placing the Fund on its preferred fund list or giving access on a preferential basis to members of the Financial Intermediary’s sales force or management).  In addition, Lord Abbett Distributor may agree to participate in the Dealer’s marketing efforts (such as by helping to facilitate or provide financial assistance for conferences, seminars or other programs at which Lord Abbett personnel may make presentations on the Fund to the intermediary’s sales force).  To the extent the Dealers sell more shares of the Fund or retain shares of the Fund in their clients’ accounts, Lord Abbett receives greater management and other fees due to the increase in the Fund’s assets.  Although a Dealer may request additional compensation from Lord Abbett to offset costs incurred by the Dealer servicing its clients, the Dealer may earn a profit on these payments, if the amount of the payment exceeds the Dealer’s costs.
 
Lord Abbett or Lord Abbett Distributor, in its sole discretion, determines the amounts of payments to Dealers, with the exception of purchases of products or services and certain expense reimbursements.  Lord Abbett and Lord Abbett Distributor consider many factors in determining the amount of any additional payments to Dealers.  These factors include, but are not limited to, the Dealer’s sales, assets and redemption rates relating to Lord Abbett Funds, penetration of Lord Abbett Fund sales among investment professionals within the Dealer, and the potential to expand Lord Abbett’s relationship with the Dealer. Lord Abbett and Lord Abbett Distributor also may take into account other business relationships Lord Abbett has with a Dealer, including other Lord Abbett financial products or advisory services sold by or provided to a Dealer or one or more of its affiliates.  Based on its analysis of these factors, Lord Abbett groups most Dealers into tiers, each of which is associated with a particular maximum amount of revenue sharing payments expressed as a percentage of assets of the Lord Abbett Funds attributable to that particular Dealer.  The tiered payments generally range from 0.02% to 0.10% of Lord Abbett Fund assets attributable to the Dealer and/or its investment professionals.  For certain relationships with Dealers selling the Lord Abbett Funds in connection with variable insurance products, Lord Abbett or Lord Abbett Distributor may make payments generally ranging from 0.05% to 0.15% of the related Lord Abbett Funds’ assets and/or sales.  However, Lord Abbett or Lord Abbett Distributor from time to time may pay revenue sharing in excess of these amounts to cultivate new relationships with Dealers it believes have the potential to sell significant amounts of Fund shares.  In such cases, Lord Abbett expects that over time, as these relationships grow, the amount of revenue sharing paid to such Dealers would conform to levels that fall within the ranges described above.  The payments may not include payments for certain items, such as training and education activities, other meetings, and the purchase of certain products and services from the Dealers.  On occasion, Lord Abbett also may make payments to Dealers on a basis unrelated to its assessment of the prospects for a long-term distribution relationship.  Not all Dealers receive revenue sharing payments and the amount of revenue sharing may vary for different Dealers.  Lord Abbett or Lord Abbett Distributor may choose not to make payments in relation to certain of the Lord Abbett Funds or certain classes of shares of any given Fund.  In addition, Lord Abbett’s method of calculating revenue sharing payments may be different from the methods that the Dealers use.  Please refer to the Fund’s Statement of Additional Information for additional information relating to revenue sharing payments.
 
Neither Lord Abbett nor Lord Abbett Distributor makes payments directly to a Dealer’s investment professionals, but rather they are made solely to the Dealer itself (with the 
 
3




 
exception of expense reimbursements related to the attendance of a Dealer’s investment professionals at training and education meetings and at other meetings involving the Lord Abbett Funds).  The Dealers receiving additional payments include those that may recommend that their clients consider or select the Fund or other Lord Abbett Funds for investment purposes, including those that may include one or more of the Lord Abbett Funds on a “preferred” or “recommended” list of mutual funds.  In some circumstances, the payments may create an incentive for a Dealer or its investment professionals to recommend or sell shares of Lord Abbett Funds to a client over shares of other funds. For more specific information about any additional payments, including revenue sharing, made to your Dealer, please contact your investment professional.
 
The Fund’s portfolio transactions are not used to compensate Dealers that sell shares of the Lord Abbett Funds.  Lord Abbett places the Fund’s portfolio transactions with broker-dealers based on their ability to provide the best net results from the transaction to the Fund.  If Lord Abbett determines that a Dealer can provide the Fund with the best net results, Lord Abbett may place the Fund’s portfolio transactions with the Dealer even though it sells or has sold shares of the Fund.  In no event, however, does or will Lord Abbett give any consideration to a Dealer’s sales in deciding which Dealer to choose to execute the Fund’s portfolio transactions.  Lord Abbett maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that it places portfolio transactions based on the Fund’s receipt of the best net results only.  These policies and procedures also permit Lord Abbett to give consideration to proprietary investment research a Dealer may provide to Lord Abbett.
