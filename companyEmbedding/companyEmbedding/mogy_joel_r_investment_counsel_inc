Our People



PeopleJoel R. Mogy. CFABrad A. Stelzer, CFAJeffrey Tomlinson, CFAThe JMIC Team







Joel R. Mogy, CFA, PresidentJoel R. Mogy’s career represents more than fifty years of investment experience as an investment counselor. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University and a Master of Business Administration degree from Columbia University. He holds a Chartered Financial Analyst designation and is a Certified Professional Licensed Fiduciary in the State of California. He began his professional career working with Peter L. Bernstein, followed by seven years with Lehman Brothers in New York. Joel subsequently returned to California to serve as a principal with the Beverly Hills investment counseling firm of Clark, Mogy and Browne. He established Joel R. Mogy Investment Counsel in 1976. Providing investment counsel on a continuous basis since 1963, Joel has invested during periods of business expansion and contraction, moderate and rapid rates of inflation, high and low interest rates, speculative booms and busts, war and peace, and political crises. With first-hand experience in a large international Wall Street firm, as a principal in a successful independent investment counsel firm, and as the principal of his own firm, he has had the opportunity to implement and evaluate the efficacy of differing investment philosophies, policies, and strategies. As Joel possesses experience with both large and small investment management organizations, he has shaped the firm to provide clients with customized, scalable investment counseling services throughout the client’s lifetime. Joel Mogy is a former member of the Board of Governors of the AJC – American Jewish Committee and is a past Chairman of Vista Del Mar Child & Family Services.  Joel is an elected member of the Stanford Associates.
