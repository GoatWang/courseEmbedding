Obituaries

1922 
Lola Mitchell Waterman Sigel, May 19, 2004.
While at Bates, Lola Mitchell Waterman Sigel earned room and board as a mother’s helper for the Peck family. In 1924, she married Erland Waterman, a prominent farmer in Sabattus. She used her experiences on the farm (which also ran an International Harvester dealership and other small enterprises) as well as the experiences of her husband’s ancestors in her 1949 book, I Fell Among Farmers. After her husband died in 1939, she struggled to keep the farm and its related businesses going, but she was forced to liquidate everything but the dairy farm itself during World War II. In 1942, she married Franz Sigel, a career Army officer (whose grandfather fought in the Civil War), but remained on the farm while he was assigned elsewhere, until her two sons completed their schooling and she could sell the farm to them. To make ends meet during the war, she taught English and Latin in Wales, Litchfield, Lisbon Falls, and Sabattus, where she was also the assistant principal. She resigned in 1956 to join her husband for a three-year tour of Germany. While there, she took a three-day bus trip to Paris that cost her $24. She wrote an article for the Lewiston Evening Journal from Germany, where she said, “We are told that we are here not as conquerors but as a member of NATO and that we are the foreigners on their soil. It behooves us to represent our country the best we can.” On her 100th birthday, she recited Longfellow’s “The Wreck of the Hesperus” from memory. Her granddaughter is Donna Waterman Douglass ’89, and her sister-in-law is Vesta Brown Mitchell ’32, the widow of Elmer L. Mitchell ’32. She is survived by sons Robert D. Waterman Sr. and Donald M. Waterman; nine grandchildren; 16 great-grandchildren; and a half-brother, F. Emerson Mitchell.
1927
Michael J. Harkins, Jan. 8, 2004.
Mike Harkins, a native of Lewiston, earned his medical degree from McGill Univ. in 1932. He returned to Lewiston for an internship at Central Maine General Hospital and remained on its staff until 1966. He also studied at Boston Univ. and Columbia. He served as a Lewiston police commissioner until World War II. During the war, he served in Iceland, North Labrador, and Italy, where he was made a major in the Army Air Corps medical corps. After leaving Central Maine General Hospital, he maintained a private practice until 1995. He was a founder of Montello Manor, a retirement community in Lewiston. His wife, the former Helen McGillicuddy, died in 1999. He is survived by three daughters, Helen Jennings, Margaret Harkins, and Nance Harkins; two sons, Michael J. Harkins Jr. and John McGillicuddy Harkins; and three grandchildren.
1929
Wendell W. Tetley, Feb. 1, 2004.
Wendell Tetley taught for 25 years in Maine and New Hampshire. He was very active in the Masons, and held the General John Sullivan Medal and the Jeremy Lass Cross Medal. As a York Rite Mason, he was excellent high priest of the Pemigewasset Chapter 13 and illustrious master of Omega Council 9. As a Scottish Rite Mason, he was a member of the New Hampshire Consistory. He was also a district grand master of the 8th Masonic District, a member of the Knights of York Cross of Honor and Order of the Temple, and a Worthy Patron of the Order of the Eastern Star. His wife, Helen, predeceased him. He leaves four sons, Vernon, Wayne, Paul, and Philip; 10 grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and a sister, Erma Tetley Morton ’29. His niece is Mary Morton Cowan ’61, whose husband is Carl Cowan ’61; their son is Timothy Cowan ’91, whose wife is Marianne Nolan Cowan ’92. His father, Rev. Edmund B. Tetley, was a member of the Class of 1899.
1930
Fred R. Dingley, April 9, 2004.
Fred Dingley climbed Mount Katahdin for the 30th time on his 78th birthday. He was a prominent educator in Maine, teaching in Lisbon and Sabattus, and serving as principal in Carmel, Mattawamkeag, Millinocket, and Lee. At Lee Academy, he was submaster and guidance counselor from 1946 to 1952, and principal from 1952 to 1971. He was also the town moderator in Lee for over 30 years. The planetarium at Lee Academy is named in his honor. He graduated cum laude from Bates with an A.B. in biblical literature and from time to time filled in as pastor at local churches. He also received a master’s from the College in 1937. Both Ricker College and Bowdoin awarded him honorary degrees. A poet, he published two books of his works. His poetry was about the world he observed on his land in Maine, and prompted Bud Leavitt, the noted outdoors writer for the Bangor Daily News, to write in 1981 that he had “a knack for putting cabin smoke into the poetic word.” When his second book sold well during the Christmas season in 1986, he remarked that it just showed how desperate people became as the deadline approached. He also mused that it might be selling well “because people can’t believe I could write it.” He was also the major author and historian in charge of preparation for the book History of a Frontier School — Lee Academy 1845-1988. He was a member of the Maine State Board of Education, 1950-61, serving as chair during his last year. He was a trustee of Husson College, 1965-81. He received Husson’s President’s Award for Distinguished Service in 1982. He was an honorary trustee of Lee Academy from 1971 until his death. He also served many educational associations as president during his career. His first wife, Margaret Lancaster Dingley, died in 1957. He married Madeline Lancaster in 1964. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a number of nieces and nephews.
Ruth Shaw French, Jan. 26, 2004.
When Ruth Shaw French retired, her fellow teachers at Fryeburg Academy instituted the Ruth French Award, given annually to the senior “who best exemplifies the spirit of dedication, enthusiasm, and good citizenship which characterize Mrs. French’s years of devotion to Fryeburg Academy.” A graduate of the academy, she taught there from 1953 to 1974. She was chair of the English and language department, dean of girls, a resident house parent, and theater coach. In 1986, she received the school’s distinguished alumni award from the Alumni Assn. In 1998, she was recognized by the Maine Senate and House for “her many years of working with young people in the areas of English and reading.” A cum laude graduate in Latin and Greek, she earned a master’s from Middlebury in 1959. At Bates, she was active in the Outing Club and many language clubs. She continued to tutor in retirement. She served as church organist for 17 years. Her husband, Thomas, predeceased her.
1931
Esther C. Cook Smith, Dec. 30, 2003.
Esther Cook Smith attended the Sorbonne after graduation, and also studied at Middlebury and McGill. She was a French and English teacher for many years in Stonington and Rockland, Maine. She retired from Williams High School in Oakland in 1966. Early in her career, she taught at an American mission in Syria. When she had occasion to visit the Univ. of Arizona and Arizona State Univ., both with over 40,000 students, she observed, “I am sure that they cannot nearly approach the success that smaller institutions like Bates achieved over many decades in teaching young people how to live happy, useful, moral lives as good family members, and good citizens of our republic.” She was an athlete at Bates, playing hockey, baseball, and soccer. She also ran track and was active with the Outing Club. Her husband, Ralph Smith Jr., died in 1994. She is survived by her son, Ralph Smith III, and her brother, William Cook.
1932
Rosamond Nichols Dustin, April 21, 2004.
Rosamond Nichols Dustin loved teaching math to children. She taught homebound children for many years, and taught in the Stratford, Conn., schools for 15 years. Following her retirement in 1971, she tutored in the adolescent ward at Bridgeport Hospital, and received a citation from the hospital for her work. In 1962 she earned a master’s degree from Fairfield Univ. She was a weaver and handbell player. She served as a director of the Housatonic Teachers Credit Union, and was active in the Literacy Volunteers of America, retired teachers associations, and the Stratford Historical Society. While at Bates, she played basketball, hockey, baseball, tennis, and soccer. She also met her husband-to-be, Elden Dustin ’32, who wrote a few years ago, “Our Bates senior year romance continues as we go into the 68th year of our marriage.” Besides her husband, she is survived by her son, Daniel; two daughters, Sara Dustin and Susan Clarke; a sister, Eleanor Wilson; 10 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
1933
Lionel A. Lemieux, Jan. 21, 2004.
Lionel Lemieux, a member of the Eastern Intercollegiate Championship Debating Team of 1933, worked his way through Bates as a telegrapher for Western Union, and later traveled throughout New England for the company. In 1940, he joined the Lewiston Evening Journal as a reporter, and retired from there in 1982 as editor of the Lewiston Daily Sun editorial page. In between, he was the city editor and an editorial writer. As a reporter, he wrote on politics, including a weekly column, and was considered the dean of Maine political writers. He also wrote a weekly newsletter on Maine for the Boston Sunday Globe from 1952 to 965. In 1956, he received the Distinguished Alumni Service award from the College. He served his class as president, as class agent, and on Reunion committees. Active in civic affairs, too, he was a corporator of the Auburn Public Library and of Central Maine General Hospital and a charter member of the Lewiston-Auburn Junior Chamber of Commerce. His first wife, Loretta, died in 1971. In 1980, he married Barbara Frost, who survives him, as do his son, Paul; his daughter, Janet McMahon; his stepdaughter, Anne Marie Clark; eight grandchildren; three step-grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. Two sons predeceased him: Lawrence, who died as an infant, and L. David Lemieux ’58. His nine brothers and two sisters predeceased him.
Samuel Scolnik, April 7, 2004.
The son of immigrants, Sam Scolnik graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in economics and sociology. His family quickly made Bates a tradition; both of Sam’s brothers are alumni, William ’35 and Edward ’39. Sam graduated from Boston Univ. School of Law in 1936, and built a career with the Veterans Administration at Togus and Washington, D.C., following service in the Army during World War II. He retired from the Veterans Board of Appeals in 1971, and enjoyed traveling to Europe and Israel with his wife, Mary Abromson Scolnik ’36. Besides his wife and brothers, he is survived by his sons, Stephen and Louis. His cousin is Louis Scolnik ’45.
Harold Yudkin, Jan. 21, 2004.
Bates taught him perseverance, Harold Yudkin once said, and it served him well. After graduating with a degree in chemistry, he headed off to medical school at the Univ. of Virginia, only to be told on the first day that he couldn’t hold a much-needed part-time job while there. So he turned on his heel and walked down the street and enrolled at the school of law. He initially entered college at 15, and spent three years at Johns Hopkins until financial considerations made Bates a more attractive option for his final year. He enlisted in the Army after Pearl Harbor and served in England. He then went on to a successful law career in Derby, Conn. He also formed a company that built a shopping center in town, as well as nearly 100 houses. He retired in 1987, and then turned his attention to his fascination with history, eventually writing a 1,500-page “first person” account of Benedict Arnold in his pre-traitorous days, entitled, When I Was a Loyal American. He theorized that Arnold, the acknowledged founder of the U.S. Navy, was discouraged when he was denied a post on a military ship after a leg injury made it impossible to ride a horse into battle. Mr. Yudkin also had a deep interest in Israel, and published articles in the Jewish Digest. He also was a founder of Beth Israel Synagogue Center in Derby. His first wife, Ida Moore Yudkin, died in 1960. He married Selma Levy in 1963, and she survives him. He is also survived by his son, Franklin, and two grandchildren.
1935
Wesley E. Baldwin, Jan. 17, 2004.
Wesley Baldwin served at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Forces Europe under General Eisenhower during World War II. He was vice president-treasurer of Sherwin Williams in Brazil until his retirement in 1974. In Sao Paulo, he was president of the Chamber of Commerce and president of the board of the American School. After retirement, he became the head of the income tax service for AARP in Fort Lauderdale, and volunteered with SCORE. He is survived by his wife, Georgia; his son, George; and three grandchildren.
Ruth Frye Tanner, March 17, 2004.
Ruth Frye Tanner used her degree in Latin to teach Latin, English, and French in New Hampshire for several years following graduation. She was an athlete while at Bates, and played soccer, hockey, basketball, and volleyball. Her husband, Harry, died in 1969. She is survived by her children, John, Cheryl Wersackas, and Melissa Gallery; four grandchildren; and many great-grandchildren.
1936
Donald J. Gautier, May 2, 2004.
Donald Gautier’s military career is the stuff of legends. He served in the Army under Gen. George S. Patton and led his company in the final liberation of Luxembourg and the advance into Germany. He was the military governor of an occupied area, and was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart. Following the war, he joined the Army Reserves, and retired as a colonel in 1973. In 1956, Maine Gov. Edmund Muskie, his classmate, awarded him the medal of excellence for use of weapons in a competition among members of the First Army. In 1957, he became superintendent of the Maine Military Academy, which trained Army and National Guard officers for promotion. He was a member of the Auburn Rifle Team, the Civilian Rifle Team, the Maine Rifle Team, which he captained in 1940, and the National Rifle Team. He was president of his class while at Bates and as an alumnus, 1956-61. He played football and baseball while a student, and enjoyed the Maine woods. In fact, at his 50th Reunion, he noted that the highlight of the past 50 years had been “guiding David Crafts Whitehouse ’36 through the woods of Maine for the last 50 years with considerable success.” He served on the executive committee of the Alumni Assn. and was vice president of his class from 1976 until his death.

John M. Haskell, Dec. 22, 2003.
“Pete” Haskell ran for office while he was a student on a platform advocating “off-campus dancing, no compulsory chapel, and other daring things.” He might have won (the record isn’t clear), because he was secretary-treasurer of his class in his junior year, and president his senior year. He also served on the student council while a senior. He played basketball and co-captained the golf team for two years. His degree was in history and government, and he went on to earn a master’s from Westfield State College.

Charles V. Lovely, April 20, 2004.
Charlie Lovely admired his father, Eugene Lovely ’11, a high school principal, and decided to follow in his footsteps. His career plans were interrupted by World War II, which he spent in the Army with a chemical engineering unit (he had a bachelor’s in biology) in the Philippines and France. After the war, he earned a master’s in education from Boston Univ. in 1947; it was there he met Elizabeth Jackson, who would become his wife. He began teaching science in Marblehead, Mass., in 1948, and retired from Marblehead High School as its principal in 1977, when he was named administrator of the year by the Massachusetts Secondary School Principals Assn. In 1971, the Marblehead school board tried to let him go (they wanted someone with a “different style”). His students staged a walkout. Hundreds of people turned out that evening in support of him, and the school board backed down. After retirement, he continued to teach at Endicott Junior College for several years. He taught Sunday school and served as president of Clifton Lutheran Church. When he and his wife retired to Wellfleet, Mass., he became moderator, deacon, and Sunday school teacher at the Congregational church there.

1942
Richard T. Carroll, Dec. 20, 2002.
Dick Carroll’s life was changed in different ways by each of his three children. His first child died at age 3 after ingesting a lethal amount of adult allergy medication. His son was born severely disabled, and requires constant care. His youngest child became ensnared in a religious cult while in college, and Dick and his wife, Marian Loveland Carroll ’42, rescued and deprogrammed her. This work led them to found an organization that became the Cult Awareness Network, and for the next 20 years, they were prominent in this field, receiving a Hall of Fame award from the organization in 1991. (In 1996, associates of the Church of Scientology bought the organization’s name and resources in bankruptcy court and changed its mission significantly, much to the distress of its former volunteers and staff, who claim CAN was forced into bankruptcy by the church.) Dick’s professional life was spent as a chemist and research associate at B.F. Goodrich, a logical extension of his B.S. from Bates and his Ph.D. from Cornell in chemistry. His father, John ’09, was head of the economics department at Bates. His two brothers, both deceased, were John ’32 and Russell ’31. His wife predeceased him. He is survived by his son, Jack, his daughter, Marcia DuFore, and one grandchild.
Robert Curtis, Feb. 7, 2004.

He served four years as a deck officer on fleet oilers. Afterwards, he took advantage of the GI Bill to get a master’s in international studies from Geneva Univ. in Switzerland. He also earned a Ph.D. in political science from Georgetown in 1959. He taught for four years at the Univ. of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and then joined the faculty at Wilson College in Pennsylvania. There, he became chair of the political science department and directed an interdisciplinary program in international studies for students interested in government or business careers abroad or with the United Nations. He retired in 1986. He is survived by his wife, Jean Crego Curtis; a sister, Barbara Lewis; and two brothers, Donald and Wallis.

Vera Vivian Peci, Jan. 30, 2004.
Despite graduating cum laude with a degree in chemistry, Viv Peci realized that she didn’t have a future in lab work, “As a female and with only a B.S., I would be standing on my feet at the lab bench until retirement,” she said after 10 years in the lab. So she turned to work in chemical literature, abstracting and searching patents at Esso, the American Petroleum Institute, and Texaco. She said she always found her training was at least as good as her co-workers, “thanks to professors Thomas and Lawrance.” She ruefully noted one time that college was almost the high point of her life (surpassed only by her first trip to Europe), “so since then it’s been all downhill.” Her husband, Herbert Peci, died in 2003.
Sibyl Witham Smith, Feb. 12, 2004.
Sibyl Witham Smith’s career ranged from teaching to designing solar greenhouses to aiding people with chronic illness. At the time of her death, she was studying for a Ph.D. in nutrition. A physics and math major at Bates, she taught in the Skowhegan schools before earning an engineering degree, which led to her designing solar greenhouses for General Electric in the 1940s. She became interested in nutrition and received a master’s in nutrition from Donsbach Univ. She also studied food service and hotel management at Schenectady County Community College. When she was diagnosed in 1990 with CFIDS, she credited her knowledge of nutrition with helping her cope with the illness. She served on the board of directors of Dayspring Institute, which helps people with chronic illness or pain. Her husband, George, predeceased her.

1944
Rita Silvia Kavanaugh, Feb. 27, 2004.
Rita Silvia Kavanaugh wrote of her years at Bates, “I arrived as a rather narrow-minded freshman. I like to think that in four years I came to appreciate myriad conflicting ideas and values garnered from all the enlightened minds down through the centuries from all civilizations, cultures, religions, and peoples.” Most of her career was in teaching. She taught in South Paris and Farmington in Maine; in Lancaster and Buffalo, N.Y.; and in Alexandria, Va. She retired in 1991. She also worked as an editor for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.

1949
Joseph S. Mitchell, Jan. 14, 2004.
Judge Joseph Mitchell had a stormy career on the bench. Even his appointment was controversial; the executive council of the Massachusetts governor’s office split 4-4, meaning that Lt. Gov. Elliot Richardson had to cast the tie-breaking vote. The dispute concerned hospital rates for people on welfare, which were regulated by his boss, the commissioner of administration. Prior to his work for the Commonwealth, he was an assistant U.S. attorney for three years, and was the first black professional to work for the SEC. On the bench, he was the first to rule on the 1967 Racial Imbalance Law, a ruling that led to Boston’s infamous busing era. In 1969, he ruled that welfare recipients were entitled to free legal aid at welfare hearings. He raised hackles when he announced that he didn’t believe in tough sentences. “You’re losing the game if you don’t try to reintegrate people back into society,” he said. In 1971, he spoke at Boston Univ., from which he received his law degree, about the injustice he saw in the legal system: “We do not have equal justice under the law in this country,” he said. The law for the rich is different than that for the poor, and the law for blacks “most times is far different” than for whites. “It is not surprising that most blacks in America have no respect for the law that has no respect for them.” He was threatened with recall when, in 1981, he released a prison inmate after he served nine years of a 36-40 year sentence for shooting and seriously wounding two police officers in Spencer, Mass. (The man was returned to jail after a few months on handgun, drug, and car theft charges.) The biggest controversy, however, came in 1989, when he claimed that Breathalyzer tests were rigged by the police, after he was stopped on suspicion of drunk driving. Although acquitted on those charges, he was found guilty of driving on the wrong side of the street and required to apologize for his remarks about the Breathalyzer. The lingering controversy forced his retirement in 1992. His experiences in the Army during World War II were, he said, his first real taste of racism, when he served in an all-black unit with white officers. He was a trustee at Boston Univ., and served on the boards of Freedom House, Crispus Attucks Children’s Center, and the Boston Legal Aid Society. He also served the College as a Trustee from 1969 to 1974, and again from 1975 to 1994. Judge Mitchell leaves his wife, Doris; two sons, Joseph and Michael; a daughter, Marcene Broadwater; a sister, Laura Holland; and four grandchildren.

Following that, he worked at Hanscom Air Force Base as a civilian financial specialist. He lectured on oceanography at the Isles of Shoals Marine Lab and published numerous articles in professional journals. He dealt with the stress of his work by chopping firewood, which he used to heat his environmentally sound house. He is survived by his parents, David and Nina Hartwell; his wife, Janice; his children, Kimberly and Douglas; and a brother.
1979
Susan J. Wanbaugh, Feb. 13, 2004.
Susan Wanbaugh started acting as a child, and studied the art her entire life. Her first performance was at a Lions Club program in Presque Isle, where she grew up. As a high school student, she was named best actress in northern Maine high schools, and even landed a coveted role while an intern at a summer stock playhouse. As a first-year student at Bates, she had the leading role in three plays. She earned money for college by competing in beauty contests. She entered a contest in Presque Isle as a lark, and was stunned when she won. Soon she was named Miss Potato Blossom by the Maine Potato Council, and finally was named Miss Maine and competed in the Miss America pageant in 1976. For her talent, she performed a monologue from Shakespeare’s As You Like It. She always faced the question of the role of beauty pageants in the heyday of the women’s liberation movement, and always answered with good grace that she was for equal opportunity, “but I am also for the right to make a choice.” At Bates, she was a Dean’s List student and a Dana Scholar. She spent her junior year in London studying speech and theater with English performers, directors, and producers. After graduation, she studied communications and marketing at Boston Univ. From 1979 to 1981, she was the marketing director for the Maine Publicity Bureau. She then became the marketing director for the Bangor Mall, advertising director for the DeOrsey stores, and finally the publishing coordinator for a firm that served hospitals and home-health agencies nationwide. She received the Brody Award for the excellence in advertising. She is survived by her mother, Carol Wanbaugh, and her stepfather, John Corsa.
1986
Andrew Braisted, Oct. 4, 2003.
Andrew Braisted earned a doctorate degree in organic chemistry from the Univ. of California at Berkeley. He went on to found Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., where he specialized in the discovery of small molecule drugs. He developed Sunesis’ core technology, which he named Tethering, a method of identifying protein fragments that can bind to each other; these promising drug fragments are then advanced swiftly through medicinal chemistry to develop drugs to treat conditions such as damage from heart attacks and graft reduction. He is survived by his wife, Joelle Morrow, M.D., and their infant son (born after his death); his parents, Gayl and Charles Braisted; and his sisters, Christina Braisted Rogers and Melissa Braisted.
Joanna Skilogianis, May 7, 2004.
Joanna Skilogianis traveled the world following graduation, and then went to grad school to continue her studies in medical anthropology. She set herself on this path while at Bates: she spent the spring semester of her junior year in Greece, and wrote an honors thesis on the sociocultural factors of abortion in that country. A dean’s list student, her interdisciplinary degree was in biology and anthropology, with a secondary in French. Her master’s degree (1992) and her doctorate (1998) came from Case Western Reserve University. She won a Fulbright scholarship and spent 1994-1995 in Athens. After completing her education, she worked at the National Center for Health Statistics and was a project manager at the time of her death. She was candid, thoughtful, and fully devoted to the people in her life. At her memorial service longtime friend Sarah Wayland recalled an e-mail exchange with Joanna after Wayland’s son was diagnosed with a language delay. “I had written, ‘It is hard to hear that your child is not perfect.’ [Joanna] was having none of that! She wrote, ‘Hey! Listen here: I will not have you saying anything about your…boy not being perfect. He is perfect and he’s yours and that’s what matters most. Lose the societal view of perfect; it can only damage you, OK?’ She went on, and in her usual fashion said exactly what needed to be said in a compassionate and loving note…. In short, she said exactly what I needed to hear.” Joanna is survived by her husband, Doug Desjardins; her sons, Alexander and Constantine; her parents, Milton and Demetra Skilogianis; her sister, Catherine; and her brother George. Her husband has established an endowed scholarship at Bates in her name.
1988
Thomas Airone, Oct. 23, 2003.
Thomas J. “Snapper” Airone died of a heart attack while playing basketball in his grade school gym with several lifelong friends. He was an attorney in New Haven, Conn., having earned a law degree from Quinnipiac Univ. Law School in 1995. In December 2002, Tom eloped to the Caribbean and married Jennifer Hayden. Only seven weeks prior to his passing he had formed his own law firm with Roger Callistro. Tom is survived by his wife; his mother, Susan Sutherland Small; his brother, Peter; and his step-sister Cathleen Kareliussen.
1990
John-Henry Williams, March 8, 2004.
John-Henry Williams attended Bates for three semesters and graduated from UMaine-Orono in 1991. When he applied to Bates, he listed his father’s occupation as “actor” — which indeed he was, the star of commercials for Nissen Bread that ran in Maine. He was also baseball great Ted Williams. Although he grew up largely separated from his dad, he did wrangle a spot as an honorary bat boy at the first Red Sox Old-timers game. As an adult, John-Henry became close to his dad, which doctors credited with extending his father’s life. Red Sox legend Johnny Pesky said John-Henry was his father’s “pride and joy.” Inspired by their new relationship, John-Henry and Ted worked on the son’s baseball skills, and he eventually managed to sign a professional contract with the Selma Cloverleafs. He officially had one hit as a pro ball player. He cared for his father as his health declined, and made the controversial decision to have his father’s body cryogenically frozen, a decision his older sister fought. John-Henry died of leukemia, the same disease that killed Ted’s brother at the age of 39, and one of the diseases his father worked to cure through his long association with The Jimmy Fund. John-Henry is survived by his mother, Dolores; his sister, Claudia Williams; and his half-sister, Bobbie-Jo Ferrell, who has vowed to renew her efforts to cremate her father’s remains.
Advanced
Harold Hickey, Dec. 27, 2003.
Harold Hickey earned a master’s degree from Bates in 1948. His 1936 undergraduate degree was from Colby, where he earned Phi Beta Kappa honors. He served in World War II as a gunnery officer in the Navy. He made five Atlantic crossings and served in the European, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern theaters, and won a battle star. From 1946 to 1961, he and his wife, Virginia, operated the Jordan Pond House near Acadia National Park, known for its tea time and warm popovers. In 1961, he joined the faculty of Broome Community College in Binghamton, N.Y., and retired as dean of liberal arts and sciences in 1975. He is survived by his wife; his son, Peter; two grandchildren; and two sisters, Dolores Blanchard and Elizabeth Blanchard.
Former Faculty
Evelyn Kathryn Dillon, Nov. 12, 2003.
Evelyn Dillon came to Bates in 1961 as professor of physical education for women after a successful career at Texas Women’s University and Wellesley College. She was one of three in a department that some considered overstaffed at the time. In 1974 she became one of two associate directors of physical education. In between, she devoted much of her time to widening the opportunities for women at Bates. She spent a sabbatical researching how P.E. requirements were handled at other colleges. She held national ratings in field hockey, basketball, and swimming. She was a nationally ranked judge in swimming, and wrote a number of articles and two books on swimming, diving, and synchronized swimming. Her Ph.D. thesis was entitled, “A Study of the Use of Music as an Aid in Teaching Swimming.” She received her doctorate from the State University of Iowa (1950), a master’s from Kent State (1942), and a bachelor’s from Ohio State (1932). She was also a camp counselor and director, and campaigned unsuccessfully to establish a course in camp counseling at Bates. She is survived by her sister, Marion Munn; her niece Margaret Dan; and her friend, Eleanore Hudgeon. 
Richard W. Sampson, April 1, 2004.
Students knew to pay close attention to Dick Sampson, professor of mathematics — daydreamers might get an eraser tossed their way. Those paying attention also knew how Sampson inspired his students with passionate teaching and an interest in their lives outside the classroom. He earned his B.S. at Bowdoin in 1944, studied at MIT, and earned his Ed.M. at Tufts in 1947. Through 1950 he taught at the Franklin Institute of Technology in Boston, following up the experience with an M.A. in mathematics at Boston Univ. in 1951. Until 1951, when he was appointed at Bates, he taught at The New Preparatory School in Cambridge, Mass. At Bates, he was the faculty advisor to the Outing Club for 25 years and worked to ensure that students powered the club and controlled their budget; he also encouraged his students to be active in the surrounding community. David Haines, mathematics professor and department chair, remembers his colleague and friend this way: “Students told colorful stories about Sampson’s classroom behavior: throwing chalk and erasers at sleeping students, screaming ‘Damn!’ when he got stuck on a calculus problem, and sketching absurdly complicated pictures as he explained the connection between projective geometry and art. He filled his classes with his own stories. He told one about using the mean value theorem when he was an Air Force meteorologist in the jungles of British Guyana during World War II. His job was to calculate the average temperature over the last 24 hours, which he did by cutting along the temperature recorded by a pen on a piece of uniform density paper, then weighing it…. He always had a problem he was working on. He would crash into the office uninvited, throw a problem up on the board and start working on it. Despite my attempts to ignore him, he always succeeded in trapping me into an hour-long session of doing what he knew I enjoyed, mathematics…. Attending mathematics meetings with Richard was a party. Famous mathematicians of his generation greeted him by name. Dick proudly refused to acknowledge those he deemed too arrogant. But he made an effort to befriend the handful of African American mathematicians at that time, and it was through his efforts that the mathematics department was able to hire the first African-American to a Bates tenure-track position….” Richard Sampson is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Stephen Byers Sampson and Elisa Hurley, and three grandchildren. He was predeceased by his wife, Jean Byers Sampson, and a son, Caleb Sampson. A memorial service was held for him at the Chapel during Reunion 2004, after which Professor Emeritus of English John Tagliabue wrote of his former colleague: “The Sampson strength in delight, in enjoying himself and our world, pure boyish delight in enjoying his connections with family, his forever admired wife, their adored sons — how pure and innocent that all was.”
