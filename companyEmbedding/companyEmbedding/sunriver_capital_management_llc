The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Soroban Capital Partners LP


                  Soroban Capital Partners generally employs two investment strategies. For some funds, the firm seeks to generate superior risk-adjusted returns. Soroban seeks to maximize risk-adjusted, absolute returns over the course of various market cycles through a portfolio consisting primarily of long and short equity investments. They aim to limit volatility and systematic risks in both long and short investments through the use of hedges consisting of individual stocks, equity and sector indices, commodities, credit, currencies, and other marketable securities. The firm implements a global, concentrated, highly liquid strategy that seeks to achieve superior returns with a low correlation to equity markets by employing a deep-rooted fundamental, value-driven approach. Soroban seeks opportunities across liquid asset classes, primarily focusing on equity long/short in global markets with a strong emphasis on the US and they may also take long and short positions in debt, convertible instruments, commodities, currencies and other marketable securities to capture equity-like returns. A variety of derivative instruments may be used for both risk management, including portfolio- and position-level hedging, and speculation. Although Soroban generally does not expect to invest in illiquid investments for these funds, they retain the right to do so if the opportunity is compelling and determined to be appropriate for the portfolio’s investment objective and liquidity profile. The funds may employ leverage through borrowings and the use of derivative instruments, although the use of financial leverage is expected to be moderate.For other funds, Soroban seeks to generate superior risk-adjusted returns and to maximize risk-adjusted returns over the course of various market cycles through a portfolio consisting primarily of concentrated equity investments, with the intent that these funds will have a net long bias and will be positively correlated to equity markets. They may seek to limit volatility and systematic risks in both their long and short investments through the use of hedges consisting of individual stocks, equity and sector indices, commodities, credit, currencies, and other marketable securities. Soroban implements a global, highly concentrated strategy that seeks to achieve superior returns by employing a deep-rooted fundamental, value-driven approach. Soroban may use a variety of derivative instruments for these funds’ portfolios. There are no diversification or concentration constraints and the funds may hold large positions in a relatively limited number of investments. Although Soroban generally does not expect to invest in illiquid investments for these funds, they retain the right to do so if the opportunity is compelling and deemed appropriate for the funds’ investment objective and liquidity profile. These Funds may also employ leverage withrespect to their portfolios through borrowings and the use of derivative instruments, though the use of financial leverage is expected to be moderate.

Published for Opposition
Any party who believes it may be damaged by the registration of the mark has thirty (30) days from the publication date to file either an opposition to registration or a request to extend the time to oppose. An opposition is similar to a proceeding in a federal court, but is held before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. If no opposition is filed or if the opposition is unsuccessful, the application continues through the registration process.
