      Wine






March 16, 2009 12:20 PM Eastern Daylight Time



DEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fortune Brands, Inc. (NYSE: FO) today announced the appointment of 
      Matthew J. Shattock as chief executive officer of its Beam Global 
      Spirits & Wine business. Shattock is a veteran leader in the consumer 
      packaged goods industry who most recently led major business units of 
      Cadbury Plc. His appointment is effective April 22, 2009.
    


      “We are delighted that Matt Shattock will be the next CEO of Beam Global 
      Spirits & Wine,” said Bruce Carbonari, chairman and chief executive 
      officer of Fortune Brands. “With his many years of experience running 
      consumer businesses in the US and internationally, Matt is a proven 
      leader with a strong record of driving growth and building powerful 
      brands. His skilled leadership and strong passion to win will serve Beam 
      Global well as we seek to further elevate the performance of the 
      business and execute its vision of ‘building brands people want 
      to talk about.’” Beam Global Spirits & Wine is the world’s fourth 
      largest premium spirits company with global premium brands including Jim 
      Beam, Sauza, Courvoisier, Maker’s Mark, Canadian Club, Cruzan and 
      Laphroaig. In 2008, Beam Global accounted for one-third of Fortune 
      Brands’ total sales and 57% of operating income before charges.
    

      “The opportunity to lead a business with such heritage and promise is 
      incredibly exciting,” said Shattock. “Beam Global’s assets – its 
      enviable portfolio of premium brands, great people and powerful vision – 
      are an excellent foundation on which to build future success. I look 
      forward to joining the Beam Global and Fortune Brands family.”
    

      Shattock comes to Beam Global following six years leading business units 
      at Cadbury Plc and 17 years at Unilever. At Cadbury, the global 
      confectionery company with 2008 sales of 5.4 billion British pounds, 
      Shattock was most recently president of the Britain, Ireland, Middle 
      East & Africa region, a business driving approximately one-third of 
      Cadbury’s total revenues. He previously served as president of Europe, 
      Middle East & Africa, and as president of Americas Confectionery. Prior 
      to joining Cadbury in 2003, Shattock was chief operating officer of 
      Unilever Best Foods North America, a $3 billion food and beverage 
      business, having previously held management and brand development 
      positions of increasing responsibility at Unilever.
    

      Shattock earned a BA with honors from Durham University (UK) and also 
      served as a tank troop commander in the British Army. He, his wife and 
      three children plan to relocate from the UK to the Chicago area.
