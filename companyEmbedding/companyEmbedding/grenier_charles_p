He served as a director of the IX Ranch Company, a large, privately held cattle ranch in Big Sandy, Montana from 2002 to 2011, as a director of Winter Sports, Inc., dba The Big Mountain Resort, formerly a publicly traded company, from 1998 to 2005, and from 2003 to 2009 as a director and member of the audit committee of Semitool, Inc., a manufacturer of tools for the production of electronic chips formerly traded on Nasdaq until it was acquired by Applied Materials, Inc. in 2010.  Having served for five years as a member of the board of directors, six years as Executive Vice President and eight years as Vice President, of a large, publicly traded timber REIT, Mr. Grenier has a strong background in timberlands, real estate and forest products, with extensive executive-level experience in publicly traded REITs, financial and operational management of timberlands and wood products and other manufacturing facilities. We believe Mr. Grenier's deep knowledge of our industry and his deep understanding of our business and operations contributes greatly to our Board's oversight of the company. Mr. Grenier's service on the boards of two other public companies has provided him with additional corporate governance, leadership and oversight experience.
