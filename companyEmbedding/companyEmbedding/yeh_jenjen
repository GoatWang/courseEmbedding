Womens Mens Thick Knit Winter Infinity Scarf

Scarves are so in style right now, and I just can’t have enough. I absolutely love my scarf. It is so very warm and cozy. The infinity scarves are my absolute favorite! I ordered the black one since black goes with everything. I can use it all the time now. In fact, I received this just as a cold front hit, and it was so nice to keep my neck and chest warm. The scarf is 100% Soft Acrylic so it comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time. The scarf is also made very well, the material is a high quality and long lasting!
I received this scarf in return for my honest review. All opinions are based on my personal experience.

I have always been scared to cut my dogs nails. Other dog clippers I have tried are hard to hold onto and maneuver with a squirmy puppy. These clippers are easy to grip and cut so easily.
It really is nice to finally be able to cut my dogs nails on my own, and have the confidence to do it.
My dog really enjoys the massager too. She flips over and gets so relaxed while I’m massaging her. It’s too cute.

Ragu Spaghetti Sauce

Posted on November 24, 2015 by jenleigh124 




My family loves spaghetti for dinner.  I love it because it’s a quick and easy meal that everyone will eat.
I don’t make homemade sauce, so I always use Ragu.  The kids love it.  I love the price and the convenience of Ragu!
I have tried other sauces in the past, but I always find myself coming back to Ragu.

I love these professional feel nail clippers. We have issues with nail clippers not holding up very well. These are very sturdy, and high quality. They are stainless steel and have a very nice, sleek look to them.
These clippers are so sharp and cut the nails perfectly and with no effort. There is nothing worse than dull nail clippers. You do not have to worry about that with these clippers. These clippers are easy to hold onto and grip. It makes it so easy to clip your nails without worrying that you are going to slip.
I received these clippers free in return for my honest review. This review is based on my personal experience with the clippers. I highly recommend them.

Tens Handheld Electronic Pulse Massager

Posted on November 9, 2015 by jenleigh124 




<a href=”http://www.tomoson.com/?code=TOP5c53f0e80fd4fca530246d67fd167a8c&#8221; rel=”nofollow”><img style=”display: none” src=”http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&#8221; /></a>
My husband suffers from back pain. He has an electric massager that he uses regularly on his back, but it just doesn’t help completely. When I saw this Tens Handheld Electronic Pulse Massager, I had to get it and let him try it out. He absolutely loves it!
I wasn’t sure what to expect since it is for personal use (in home) and the unit itself is fairly small. However, this massager does not disappoint. There are six different settings with different pulse types. The max massage time is 15 minutes, but you can focus on different areas of the body. Back, legs, feet, etc. You can also choose between, knead, massage, and beat. This is a nice feature.
This massager is very easy to use, and to get started. It is not complicated. The most difficult part of getting started is to decide which setting you want to start on. The massager even came with the batteries. That was very nice. It’s ready to go right out of the box.
I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest review. All opinions are based on my personal experience.

Annie’s Soup

Posted on October 22, 2015 by jenleigh124 




I received this at the perfect time. My son was home sick, and he wanted some good soup. I quickly warmed this up for him before he lost his appetite! He really enjoyed it. I liked it because it is all organic and healthier than other pre-prepared brands.
I personally thought it could have used a little more flavor, but to have on hand for sick kids or for a cold night, it was ok.

Viter Energy Mints

Posted on October 22, 2015October 22, 2015 by jenleigh124 





Viter Energy mints are an ingenious way to replace your morning cup of coffee. Each ~$5 tin comes with 20 mints at 40mg of caffeine each, about half the amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee. These mints have an extremely strong mint flavor which took me a few mints to get used to, but once I did I found the flavor sweet, strong, and enjoyable. For the amount of time I used these mints I completely stopped drinking coffee. Instead of sluggishly waking up and trying to brew a pot of coffee in a sleepy haze, I could simply pop two of these and experience equal, if not more effects and a much better taste. These mints are perfect to take in the car, to class, or to work (they helped me complete several closing shifts). My only complaint would have to be the flavor. Although the mint/menthol is VERY strong, it does not completely overcome the bitter/medicinal taste of 40mg caffeine and the other vitamins in the mint. That being said, I would still take two of these mints over a coffee any morning! It is comparable to the difference between a Monster/Redbull and a 5 Hour Energy Shot. 5 Hour Energy does not taste as good, but it gets the job done in a more efficient and effective manner.





Knife Sharpener 2 Stage Diamond Hone Pro Chef Kitchen Tools Stainless Steel Twin Sharpening System

Posted on October 22, 2015October 22, 2015 by jenleigh124 




We do a lot of home cooking at our house. Our knives are constantly dull, and I am always complaining to my husband that they need sharpened. So, when I saw this item, I knew we had to have it. I didn’t tell my husband I ordered it. So he was surprised when I gave it to him. Luckily, I didn’t save it for Fathers Day or Christmas. 😉
He was actually excited. He hates having to manually sharpen the knives. And, I’m always scared he’s going to cut himself. Anyways, he absolutely loves this knife sharpener. He said it is so easy to use. He went through our kitchen and sharpened all of our knives right away. He said the kids are not allowed anywhere near the knives now.
The sharpener is very easy to use and hold on to with the nice grip. It is a decent size so it stores easily. This is a great product and a must have.
I received this item in return for my honest review. All opinions are based on my personal experience. 





Vittoria’s Essential Red Wine Aerator Decanter

Posted on October 21, 2015 by jenleigh124 




<a href=”http://www.tomoson.com/?code=TOP0ff322e8453e41b617246b5d81e1e182&#8243; rel=”nofollow”><img style=”display: none” src=”http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&#8221; /></a>
This product is great. I love red wine. Love it. But I don’t always love spending a lot of money for a good, full body and flavor wine. The insert in the box it says ‘try it with a cheap bottle, and I guarantee it will taste better’ so that’s what I did. I went to the supermarket, bought a cheap bottle of wine, went straight home to test. I opened my bottle, and poured a glass to drink before trying the aerator to be able to taste the difference the aerator made. After taking a sip of the un-aerated wine, I poured a glass using this my new fabulous aerator. It was super easy to use, and you can hear it aerating your wine as you pour which I thought was kind of neat. So I took a sip of the aerated stuff, and I couldn’t even tell that I only spent 5$ on this bottle. It tasted so much better. The flavor was smooth, refined, and full bodied. Just as red wine should be. I’m so happy to have this product, because not only has it improved my wine drinking experience, but now I will also save a ton of money on wine because of this thing.
It also has a stand to keep it on at home, and a bag to carry it with you wherever you drink wine haha I love it so much; and I plan on buying one for my mother in law as well. Awesome product, and I definitely recommend to wine drinkers everywhere that want the quality of an aerated wine, but not the wait time.
I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review.  All opinions are based on my personal experience.

Oleavine Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak

Posted on October 21, 2015October 21, 2015 by jenleigh124 




I have used Oleavine’s Tea Tree Shower Gel, and absolutely loved it. I was so excited to see that they have a foot soak as well. With a bunch of athletic boys in the house, this is a must have for us. The boys love the foot soak because it feels good to relax and soak their feet. It makes it much easier to get them to sit down and soak their feet because they actually enjoy it. I like it because it helps keep their feet clean and fungus free and it helps with the nasty feet smell!
I love the smell too. It is a bit strong, but I like the tea tree smell. This is a huge bag, and it only takes a little bit to be effective. This is really a must have for our house.
I received this at a discounted price in return for my honest review. All opinions are based on my personal experience.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).





                                Provider Last Name (Legal Name)

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA. (First and last names are required for initial applications.) The First, Middle, Last and Credential(s) fields allow the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon. A field cannot contain all special characters.
