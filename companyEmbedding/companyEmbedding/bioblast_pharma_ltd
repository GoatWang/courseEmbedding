 Mission and values
 





Mission and values for Bioblast Pharma
A mission guided by the goal to improve patients’ lives
For some patients, hope is as rare as the diseases that affect their lives. Therapeutic options for these patients are very limited and don’t address the underlying causes of their devastating genetic disorders.
As a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of people living with rare and ultra-rare disorders, Bioblast Pharma has made it its goal to be at the forefront of the development and commercialization of safe and effective solutions for patients in dire need of therapy.
We are driven to achieve this mission by adhering to our core principles:

Scientific rigor: Developing an optimal groundbreaking therapy that may provide positive disease modifying outcomes through a deep understanding of disease processes
Innovation: Nurturing our collective ability to find new ways of approaching intractable medical matters
Therapeutic versatility: Addressing the therapeutic needs for numerous rare diseases
Effectiveness: Utilizing our collective talents to change the course of targeted diseases and make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients

 OPMD patients
 





People living with OPMD
Committed to rare diseases so patients can have hope
What is oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (also known as OPMD)?
OPMD is a PolyA muscular disease that affects mainly the muscles of the eyes, throat (pharynx), and eventually the limbs.
For many patients, the onset of OPMD generally occurs in the 4th or 5th decade of life. The first symptom is usually drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) followed by difficulties in swallowing (dysphagia). Limb muscles become affected later in the disease process. Muscles of the face and eyes may also be affected. Because of the swallowing difficulties, the disease can be associated with marked weight loss, malnutrition, and recurrent bouts of aspiration pneumonia.
OPMD is a genetic disorder that is usually transmitted in a dominant fashion (ie, there's a 50% chance that an affected parent may transmit a genetic disorder to each offspring). The genetic defect is in a gene that encodes a protein called PABPN1. This mutation can be diagnosed by a molecular blood test. The disease is more frequent in French Canadians in Quebec, Canada, Hispanics in the US, and Bukharan Jews, but OPMD has been recorded in numerous other locales and countries around the world.
Currently there is no pharmacotherapeutic intervention that can alleviate the symptoms of the disease or slow its progression, which leads to marked reduction in quality of life. Various surgical approaches can temporarily improve swallowing. Ptosis can also be surgically corrected. These procedures do not affect the progression of the disease and the symptoms usually reappear.

Bioblast Pharma Pipeline
A focused pipeline to address unmet therapeutic needs in rare and ultra-rare diseases
Bioblast Pharma has made it a priority to address the significant unmet needs of the rare and ultra-rare disease community focusing our efforts on trehalose 90 mg/mL IV solution, an investigational drug that is currently in Phase 2 development. Bioblast has commenced a scientific and business assessment to determine the suitability of using trehalose IV solution in other orphan diseases.
Given the interest in the scientific and medical community with regard to alternative therapeutic uses of trehalose, we have decided to concentrate our internal development efforts exclusively on this drug candidate, which will enable us to leverage our extensive knowledge and expertise from our R&D and manufacturing efforts.

"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
