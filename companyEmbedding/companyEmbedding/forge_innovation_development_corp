Product Forge and the Cancer Innovation Challenge are running an open cancer "data dive" event at CodeBase in Edinburgh from Thursday 15th to Sunday 18th June 2017.
Entrepreneurially minded data scientists and analysts, clinicians, designers, and software engineers will spend 3 days and 3 nights side by side developing data focused projects to improve cancer care in the NHS in Scotland.
Participants form small cross-functional teams to work on a product prototype with support from subject matter experts and the wider technology community. In addition to a large collection of NHS open data, participants will also have access to computer generated synthetic data. These are representative of the structure but not the content of the following data sets used by the NHS:

Prescribing Information System (PIS) Data
Scottish Morbidity Records: Cancer Registry Data
Scottish Morbidity Records: General / Acute Inpatient and Day Case Data
National Records of Scotland: Deaths Registrations

This new data released for the event enables the development of tools and processes that could later, with appropriate NHS data control, be applied in real healthcare settings. The source code used for its generation will also be released, and there will be an opportunity to build on the original work on the synthetic data sets. 
Whether you already have an idea that you would like to prototype or you would just like to make new connections, we invite you to come along and meet talented people with a shared interest in innovation in cancer care.
Use this opportunity to develop your career, gain new skills, network with professionals, meet potential employers or even kick-start your own company while working on an important subject that affects many lives.
All our participants receive mentoring, 10 free meals and 24 hour access to the venue, and the top ranking teams can access support to develop their concept beyond the event, including further access to NHS experts and data.

We believe there are only limited barriers to entry in our business. Current and
future competitors may have more resources than we have. Our projects face
competition generally from REITs, institutional pension plans and other public
and private real estate companies and private real estate investors for the
acquisition of properties and for raising capital. In transaction services, we
face competition with other real estate firms in the acquisition and disposition
of properties, and we also compete with other sponsors of real estate for
investors to provide the capital to allow us to make these investments. We also
compete against other real estate companies who may be chosen by a broker-dealer
as an investment platform instead of us. In management services, we compete with
other properties for viable investors for properties. We also believe that our
broker dealers compete, or will compete, with institutions that provide or
arrange for other types of financing through private or public offerings of
equity or debt and from traditional bank financings. 

Real estate development is a highly competitive business. We compete with
numerous developers, builders and others for the acquisition of property. As we
attempt to expand our operations we will certainly be competing with other
business ranging from large multinational corporations to small startup business
such as ourselves. Many of our competitors may have longer operating histories,
better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. To
successfully compete in our industry, we will need to: 

. Ensure that investments in our projects are affordable;                 
                                                                           
. That we only invest in properties in well-priced locations;          
                                                                          
. That our investment strategy is simple to understand; and               
                                                                              
. That we provide outstanding customer service and rigid integrity in our 
  business dealings.                                                            

However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be
able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry. We believe
that we have the required management expertise in sourcing properties with good
development potential and affordable price. 

We are committed to work and communicate with our investors and sales
consultants to identify their goals and needs which will make it easier to
continually provide them with the best products and services.


Company Description
The Company’s primary objective is commercial and residential land development,
including, to a lesser extent, the possible purchase and sale of real estate,
targeting properties primarily in Southern California. We also intend to manage
properties we own and properties owned by unaffiliated third


 parties. Our
activities will include securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining
zoning and other entitlements for the properties, securing financing for
purchase of the properties, improving the properties’ infrastructure and
amenities and selling the properties to homeowner and commercial owners for
restaurants, offices and small businesses. Our first property acquisition was 29
acres in Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Due to problems with permits
and adjacent landowners, rather than get involved in protracted negotiations,
the Company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit.
---

Forge Innovation Development Corp. (“FORGE”), was originally formed to develop
approximately 29 acres of land in Desert Hot Springs, California. In March, 2017
the Company sold that property and is currently looking for other properties
both land and buildings in Southern California to develop and/or manage. The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 15, 2016, and was
formerly known as YOU-GO Enterprises, LLC. In November, 2016, the Company
changed its status from an LLC to a corporation and changed its name to Forge
Innovation Development Corp.
---

Our principal executive office is located at 17700 Castleton Street, Suite 469
City of Industry, CA 91748. Telephone number: 626-361-1393.

ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

	This
	prospectus relates to the offer and sale of 4,938,535 shares of common stock (the “Shares”) of Forge Innovation Development
	Corp. (“Forge” or the “Company”), $.0001 par value per share, by the holders thereof who are deemed to be
	statutory underwriters. The shares offered by the selling shareholders (the “Shares”) will be offered at a price of
	$0.25 until the Company’s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange or is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board
	(or a successor); after which, the selling shareholders may sell their shares at prevailing market or privately negotiated price,
	including (without limitation) in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary broker’s transactions, privately-negotiated
	transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale.




	 




	The
	maximum number of Shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering by the selling shareholders is (in aggregate)
	4,938,535 Shares. Funds received by the selling shareholders will be immediately available to such selling shareholders for use
	by them. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling Shareholder Shares. All costs incurred in the
	registration of the Shares and the Selling Shareholder Shares are being borne by the Company.




	 




	The
	offering will terminate twenty-four (24) months from the date that the registration statement relating to the Shares is declared
	effective, unless earlier fully subscribed or terminated by the Company. The Company intends to maintain the current status and
	accuracy of this prospectus and to allow selling shareholders to offer and sell the Shares for a period of up to two (2) years,
	unless earlier completely sold, pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.




	 




	Prior
	to this offering, there has been no public market for the Company’s common stock. No assurances can be given that a public
	market will develop following completion of this offering or that, if a market does develop, it will be sustained. The offering
	price for the Shares has been arbitrarily determined by the Company and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the
	assets, operations, book or other established criteria of value of the Company. The Shares will become tradable on the effective
	date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.




	 




	Neither
	the Company nor any selling shareholders has any current arrangements nor entered into any agreements with any underwriters, broker-dealers
	or selling agents for the sale of the Shares. If the Company or selling shareholders can locate and enter into any such arrangement(s),
	the Shares will be sold through such licensed underwriter(s), broker-dealer(s) and/or selling agent(s).

	PROSPECTUS
	SUMMARY





	 





	This
	summary highlights some information from this prospectus, and it may not contain all the information important to making an investment
	decision. A potential investor should read the following summary together with the more detailed information regarding the Company
	and the common stock being sold in this offering, including “Risk Factors” and the financial statements and related
	notes, included elsewhere in this prospectus.





	 





	The
	Company





	 





	History





	 




	Forge
	Innovation Development Corp. (the “Company” or “FORGE”), was originally formed to develop approximately 29
	acres of land in Desert Hot Springs, California. In March, 2017 the Company sold that property and is currently looking for other
	properties both land and buildings in Southern California to develop and/or manage. The Company was incorporated in the State
	of Nevada on January 15, 2016, and was formerly known as YOU-GO Enterprises, LLC. In November, 2016, the Company changed
	its status from an LLC to a corporation and changed its name to Forge Innovation Development Corp.





	 







	Business





	 




	The
	Company’s primary objective is commercial and residential land development, including the purchase and sale of real estate, targeting
	properties primarily in Southern California. We also intend to manage properties we own and properties owned by unaffiliated third
	parties. Our activities will include securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the
	properties, securing financing for purchase of the properties, improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities and
	selling the properties to homeowner and commercial owners for restaurants, offices and small businesses. Our first property acquisition
	was 29 acres in Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners, rather than get
	involved in protracted negotiations, the Company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit.




	 





	Risks
	and Uncertainties facing the Company





	 




	As
	a development stage company, the Company has limited operating history and has experienced losses since its inception. The Company
	needs to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. As a development
	stage company, management of the Company has limited experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the
	Company and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale.




	 




	One
	of the biggest challenges facing the Company is the ability to raise adequate capital to pursue its business plan of land acquisition,
	land development and construction, sale or lease of projects and providing real estate management services.




	 




	Due
	to financial constraints, the Company has to date conducted limited operations. If the Company were unable to develop strong and
	reliable sources of funding, it is unlikely that the Company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further
	develop its business plan. Moreover, the above assumes that the Company’s efforts are met with customer satisfaction in
	the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its real estate projects amongst the potential base of customers, neither of which
	are currently known or guaranteed.




	 





	Trading
	Market





	 




	Currently,
	there is no trading market for the securities of the Company. The Company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation
	of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process. There can
	be no assurance that the Company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.





	 







	The
	Offering





	 




	The
	maximum number of Shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering is 4,938,535. The offering will terminate twenty-four
	(24) months from the date of this prospectus unless earlier terminated by the Company.




	 




	This
	prospectus relates to the offer and sale of 4,938,535 shares of common stock of Forge Innovation Development Corp. offered by
	the holders thereof who are deemed to be statutory underwriters. The selling shareholders will offer their shares at a price of
	$0.25 until such time as the Shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and only thereafter at prevailing market or privately
	negotiated prices in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary broker’s transactions, privately-negotiated transactions
	or through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing market if a market should develop.

	RISK
	FACTORS





	 




	A
	purchase of any Shares is an investment in the Company’s common stock and involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider
	carefully the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in the registration statement
	of which this prospectus is a part, before the purchase of any Shares. If any of the following risks actually occur, the business,
	financial condition or results of operations of the Company would likely suffer, the market price of the common stock would likely
	decline, and investors could lose all or a portion of their investment. The Company has listed the following risk factors which
	it believes to be that material to an investment decision in this offering.

	have a limited operating history on which to judge our business prospects and management.





	 




	The
	Company was originally formed as a limited liability company in January, 2016 and after organizing and developing a business plan
	it began more formal operations in April, 2016. Accordingly, we have only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation
	of our business and prospects. Operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot assure
	you that the Company will achieve or sustain profitability. The Company’s prospects must be considered in light of the risks
	encountered by companies in the early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Future
	operating results will depend upon many factors, including increasing the number of affiliates, our success in attracting and
	retaining motivated and qualified personnel, our ability to establish short term credit lines, our ability to develop and market,
	develop and manage real estate, control costs, and general economic conditions. We cannot assure you that the Company will successfully
	address any of these risks.




	 





	The
	Company has accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2017 of $131,214.





	 




	As
	of March 31, 2017, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $131,214. This deficit may impact on the Company in various ways
	including, but not limited to, making it more difficult to borrow money, sell stock or to maintain a good market price.




	 





	We
	are significantly influenced by our officers, directors and entities affiliated with them.





	 




	In
	the aggregate, ownership of the Company’s shares by management and affiliated parties, and assuming all Shares offered are
	sold, represents approximately 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Mr. Liang, acting alone, will be able
	to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval
	of mergers or other business combinations transactions. Our future performance is dependent on the ability to retain key personnel.
	The Company performance is substantially dependent on the performance of senior management. The loss of the services of any of
	its executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations
	and financial condition.




	 





	We
	may need and may be unable to obtain additional funding on satisfactory terms, which could dilute our stockholders or impose burdensome
	financial restrictions on our business.





	 




	We
	have relied upon cash from the sale of our assets and financing activities and in the future we intend to rely on revenues generated
	from operations to fund all of the cash requirements of our activities. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate
	any significant cash from our operating activities in the future. Deteriorating global economic conditions and the effects of
	ongoing military actions against terrorists may cause prolonged declines in investor confidence in and accessibility to capital
	markets. Future financing may not be available on a timely basis, in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us. This financing
	may also dilute existing stockholders’ equity. Any debt financing or other financing of securities senior to common stock will
	likely include financial and other covenants that will restrict our flexibility. At a minimum, we expect these covenants to include
	restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Any failure to comply with these covenants would have a material
	adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations because we could lose our existing sources
	of funding and impair our ability to secure new sources of funding.




	  





	Many
	very large and well-funded companies have or are entering into various aspects of the real estate market that we intend serve
	or that they are offering real estate products and services that directly or indirectly compete with our proposed products and
	services. These companies will be able to offer products and services that will directly compete with our products & services.






	 





	Forge
	intends to develop real estate and to build housing, commercial and other structures and manage these properties and similar properties
	for other real estate owners. Numerous world class companies have entered into various aspects of our market. There currently
	are a number of companies in California that have already occupied a big portion of the market in which we intend to operate.
	As a small, early-stage company, it is uncertain if and how we will be able to compete with the new competitors and products that
	are being announced and deployed. While we believe that we currently have a competitive advantage because of our proposed marketing
	strategy we cannot give any assurance that we will in fact be able to successfully compete with the existing or new competitors
	in this mature and evolving marketplace.

	Our
	future revenue depends on the price of the properties acquired and sold.





	 




	Failure
	of our future development projects to provide competitive investment returns could significantly impair our ability to finance
	and market future projects. Our inability to spread risk among a large number of projects could cause us to be over-reliant on
	our sole development. We may be unable to grow our projects, which would cause us to fail to satisfy our business strategy.




	 




	A
	significant element of our business strategy is the growth in the number of our projects. The consummation of any future projects
	will be subject to raising adequate capital for the investment, identifying appropriate assets for acquisition and effectively
	and efficiently closing the transactions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and invest in additional properties
	or will be able to raise adequate capital in the future.




	 





	If
	third-party developers or contractors providing construction services for our future projects are negligent in their performance
	of, or default on, their obligations, we may become subject to unforeseen liabilities. Additionally, if some of our contractors
	are not bonded it may limit our ability to recover for non-performance. If this occurs, it could have an adverse effect on our
	financial condition and operating results.





	 




	We
	expect to enter into third-party agreements with respect to properties we may acquire in the future. We do not supervise the personnel
	of these third parties on a day-to-day basis and we cannot assure you that they will construct improvements in a manner that is
	consistent with their obligations under their agreements, that they will not be negligent in their performance or engage in other
	criminal or fraudulent activity, or that these third parties will not otherwise default on their obligations to us. If any of
	the foregoing occurs, the relationships with our investors could be damaged and we could incur liabilities resulting from loss
	or injury to the properties or to persons at the properties. If we are unable to sell the properties or we become subject to significant
	liabilities as a result of third-party performance issues, our operating results and financial condition could be substantially
	harmed.




	 





	To
	execute our business strategy, we or our new projects may be required to incur indebtedness to raise sufficient funds to purchase
	properties.





	 




	One
	of our business strategies is to develop new projects. The development of a new project requires the identification and subsequent
	acquisition of properties when the opportunity arises. In some instances, in order to effectively and efficiently complete a project,
	we may provide deposits for the acquisition of property or actually purchase the property for resale. If we do not have cash on
	hand available to pay these deposits or fund an acquisition, we may be required to incur additional indebtedness, which indebtedness
	may not be available on acceptable terms. If we incur substantial debt, we could lose our interests in any properties that have
	been provided as collateral for any secured borrowing, or we could lose our assets if the debt is recourse to us. In addition,
	our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay these obligations upon their maturity, making it necessary for us
	to raise additional capital or dispose of some of our assets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to borrow additional debt
	on satisfactory terms, or at all.




	 





	Our
	failure to manage future growth effectively may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.





	 




	We
	may experience rapid growth in our operations, which may place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational
	and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively.
	Our ability to grow also depends upon our ability to successfully hire, train, supervise and manage new employees, obtain financing
	for our capital needs, expand our systems effectively, allocate our human resources optimally, maintain clear lines of communication
	between our transactional and management functions and our finance and accounting functions and manage the pressures on our management
	and our administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately
	anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we continue to expand our operations, and we may not be able to
	manage growth effectively or to achieve growth at all. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material
	adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.





	 







	Broad
	Indemnification Provided to Management





	 




	The
	governing documents of the Company limit the liability of, and provide indemnification for, the Management and the respective
	directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and the Management. The indemnification provided is to the full extent
	permitted under applicable Nevada law. Those provisions may limit certain rights of the shareholders against such parties, and
	moreover, an indemnification by the Company of the Management or any indemnified individual may result in substantial out-of-pocket
	costs and expenses payable by the Company. If the Company is forced to provide indemnification for any of these indemnified parties,
	it is possible that the assets of the Company could become depleted or the Company may otherwise suffer a material adverse financial
	consequence as a result of its indemnity obligations. As of the date of this prospectus, to the knowledge of the Company, there
	is no pending litigation or proceeding that exists involving a director, officer, employee or agent of the Management or the Company
	where indemnification will be required or permitted.

	Risks
	Related to the Real Estate Market





	 




	Our
	Business And Financial Condition Could Be Adversely Affected By Real Estate, Economic And Other Conditions Generally.





	 




	The
	real estate industry can be volatile and is affected by changes in national, global and local economic conditions. We may also
	be affected by events such as employment levels, availability of financing, interest rates, consumer confidence and the demand
	for housing and other types of construction. We are subject to various risks, many of which are outside our control, including:




	 





	 



	●




	real estate market conditions both in California, and
	in areas where potential customers reside;






	 





	 



	●




	decreased consumer spending for housing;






	 





	 



	●




	changing demographic conditions;






	 





	 



	●




	competitive overbuilding;






	 





	 



	●




	adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, earthquakes,
	landslides and fires;






	 





	 



	●




	delays in construction schedules and cost overruns;






	 





	 



	●




	changes in government regulations or requirements;






	 





	 



	●




	increases in real estate taxes and other local government
	fees; and






	 





	 



	●




	availability and cost of land, materials and labor.






	 




	A
	negative development caused by any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.




	 





	A
	decline in the general economy or the real estate market would harm our business

	.




	 




	Our
	business is negatively impacted by periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates and declining demand for real
	estate. These economic conditions could have a number of effects, which could have a material adverse impact on certain segments
	of our business, including a decline in:




	 





	 



	●




	the supply of capital invested in commercial real estate
	or in commercial real estate investors; and






	 





	 



	●




	the value of real estate, which would cause us to realize
	lower proceeds from property sales.






	 




	The
	real estate market tends to be cyclical and related to the condition of the economy and to the perceptions of investors and users
	as to the economic outlook. A downturn in the economy or the real estate market could have a material adverse effect on our business,
	financial condition or results of operations.




	 





	An
	increase in interest rates may cause us to lose potential investors to alternative investments.





	 




	As
	interest rates rise, valuations of commercial real estate properties typically decline. A decrease in both the attractiveness
	of our projects and the value of assets held by these projects could cause a decline in our ability to attract investors, which
	would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.




	 





	Increasing
	competition for the acquisition of real estate may impede our ability to make future acquisitions which would reduce the sales
	profit and fees we generate from future property sales and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.





	 




	The
	real estate industry is highly competitive on an international, national and regional level. Our projects face competition from
	REITs, institutional pension plans, and other public and private real estate companies and private real estate investors for the
	acquisition of properties and for raising capital to make these acquisitions. Competition may prevent us from acquiring desirable
	properties or increase the price they must pay for real estate. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing
	for suitable investment properties may increase, resulting in increased demand and increased prices paid for these properties.
	If we pay higher prices for properties, investors may experience a lower return on investment and be less inclined to invest in
	our next project which may decrease our profitability. Increased competition for properties may also preclude us from acquiring
	properties that would generate the most attractive returns to investors or may reduce the number of properties we could acquire,
	which could have an adverse effect on our business.




	 





	Illiquidity
	of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our project
	properties and harm our financial condition.





	 




	Because
	real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly facilitate sales of our proposed projects in response
	to changing economic, financial and investment conditions may be limited. In particular, these risks could arise from weakness
	in the market, changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers, changes in regional, national or international
	economic conditions, and changes in laws, regulations or fiscal policies. Fees from the disposition of improvements would be materially
	affected if we were unable to facilitate a significant number of sales.

	Land
	development permits and approvals are required to develop real property. These permits and approvals will vary depending on the
	land that is being developed.





	 




	The
	residential and commercial real estate development industry is subject to substantial environmental, building, construction, zoning
	and real estate regulations that are imposed by various federal, state and local authorities. In developing a community, we must
	obtain the approval of numerous government agencies regarding such matters as permitted land uses, housing density, the installation
	of utility services (such as water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone and cable television) and the dedication of acreage for open
	space, parks, schools and other community purposes. Regulations affect homebuilding by specifying, among other things, the type
	and quality of building materials that must be used, certain aspects of land use and building design and the manner in which homebuilders
	may conduct their sales, operations, and overall relationships with potential home buyers. Furthermore, changes in prevailing
	local circumstances or applicable laws may require additional approvals, or modifications of approvals previously obtained.




	 




	Timing
	of the initiation and completion of development projects depends upon receipt of necessary authorizations and approvals. Because
	of the provisional nature of these approvals and the concerns of various environmental and public interest groups, the approval
	process can be delayed by withdrawals or modifications of preliminary approvals and by litigation and appeals challenging development
	rights. Our ability to develop projects could be delayed or prevented due to litigation challenging previously obtained governmental
	approvals. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to
	building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future.
	Such delays could adversely affect our ability to complete our projects, significantly increase the costs of doing so or drive
	potential customers to purchase competitors’ products.




	 





	Uninsured
	and underinsured losses may adversely affect operations.





	 




	We
	will obtain coverage that has policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are customarily carried for similar properties.
	We cannot assure you, however, that particular risks that are currently insurable will continue to be insurable on an economic
	basis or that current levels of coverage will continue to be available. In addition, we generally do not obtain insurance against
	certain risks, such as floods.




	 




	Should
	we sustain damage to any of our proposed projects or a potential occupant sustains an injury, we may incur losses due to insurance
	deductibles, co-payments on insured losses or uninsured losses. In the event of a substantial property loss or personal injury,
	the insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full damages. In the event of an uninsured loss, we could lose some or
	all of our capital investment, cash flow and anticipated profits related to one or more properties. Inflation, changes in building
	codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and other factors also might make it not feasible to use insurance proceeds
	to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under these circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive, if
	any, might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the property. In the event of a significant loss,
	the remaining insurance under the applicable policy, if any, could be insufficient to adequately insure the remaining properties.
	In this event, securing additional insurance, if possible, could be significantly more expensive than the current policy. A loss
	or an increase in premium as a result of a loss could decrease the income from or value of our Project property. Any decrease
	or loss in fees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.




	 





	Environmental
	regulations may adversely impact our business or cause us to incur costs for cleanup of hazardous substances or wastes or other
	environmental liabilities.





	 




	Federal,
	state and local laws and regulations impose various environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, and disclosure obligations
	which impact the management, development, use, and/or sale of real estate. These laws and regulations tend to discourage sales
	activities with respect to some properties, and by decreasing or delaying those transactions may adversely affect the results
	of operations and financial condition of our business. In addition, a failure by us to disclose environmental concerns in connection
	with the disposition of project properties may subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of property.




	 




	Additionally,
	we may be obliged under the debt financing arrangements on the properties owned by us, to provide an indemnity to the lenders
	for environmental liabilities and to remediate any environmental problems that might arise. Insurance for these matters may not
	be available.




	 





	Our
	business is sensitive to interest rates and the ability of consumers to obtain mortgage financing which could reduce our revenues.





	 




	The
	ability of the ultimate buyers of our properties to finance their purchases is generally dependent on their personal savings and
	availability of third party financing. As a result, demand for housing and consequently, the land that we sell, will be adversely
	affected by increases in interest rates, unavailability of mortgage financing, increasing housing costs and unemployment levels.
	Levels of income and savings, including retirement savings, available to home purchasers can be affected by further declines in
	the capital markets. Any significant increase in the prevailing low mortgage interest rate environment or decrease in available
	credit could reduce consumer demand for housing, and result in fewer home sales or lower sale prices.




	 





	Increased
	development costs beyond our control could adversely affect our profitability.





	 




	Changes
	in development plans and specifications, delays due to compliance with governmental requirements or imposition of fees not yet
	levied, or other delays resulting from adverse weather, strikes or energy shortages, shortages of material for construction, inflation,
	environmental, zoning, title or other legal matters, as well as other unknown contingencies could cause development costs to exceed
	the amounts produced by any project. In the event that costs exceed funds available, our ability to complete development of projects
	will depend upon our ability to supply additional funds. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds available for that
	purpose.




	 




	The
	extended time frame from the date of an investment in a project until its expected profitability makes our business risky.

	Fluctuations
	in market conditions may affect our ability to sell our land at expected prices, if at all, which could adversely affect our revenues,
	earnings and cash flows.





	 




	We
	are subject to the potential for significant fluctuations in the market value of land we may hold in inventory. There is a lag
	between the time we acquire control of the undeveloped land and the time that we can complete the improvements on a project of
	the buildings and homes constructed and to be constructed for sale to third parties. This lag time will vary from site to site
	as it is impossible to determine in advance the length of time it will take to obtain government approvals and permits. The risk
	of owning undeveloped land can be substantial as the market value of undeveloped land can fluctuate significantly as a result
	of changing economic and market conditions. Inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing
	development or market. Material write-downs of the estimated value of our land inventory could occur if market conditions deteriorate.
	We could also be forced to sell land or lots for prices that generate lower profit than we anticipate, and may not be able to
	dispose of our investment in a timely manner when we find dispositions advantageous or necessary.




	 




	Fluctuating
	operating results may affect the price of our stock. Because some of our real estate projects may be long term in nature, our
	business cycle may not correspond to our fiscal year or other reporting periods. As a result, our fiscal year operating results
	are likely to vary from period to period, even if we were to have a successful project operating as planned, and could vary significantly
	over the life of any given project.




	 




	A
	community may generate strong operating results when first presented for sale, whether because of local pent-up demand or other
	reasons. However, during later periods over the life of the same community, periods of weaker results may occur. In addition to
	external factors, our revenues and earnings are affected by the volume and price of lots that we bring to market at any given
	point in time, which reflect, in part, our strategy of developing houses in phases. As a result, the timing and amount of revenues
	and profits are subject to considerable variation and uncertainty. The impact on our earnings and cash flow is not and, in the
	future, may not be, balanced by results of other operations, which could have a moderating effect on the variability of our results.




	 





	Our
	commercial and intended homebuilding operations may be conducted through joint ventures with local commercial builders and homebuilders,
	and if we are unable to enter into satisfactory joint venture arrangements on favorable terms, our business and results of operations
	may suffer a material adverse effect.





	 




	We
	intend to conduct our commercial building and homebuilding operations through traditional contractor arrangements with local builders.
	Going forward, we may also construct and sell homes in the residential communities that we develop through joint ventures with
	builders. There can be no assurance that we can reach future arrangements with such commercial builders or homebuilders or other
	builders on terms that are favorable to us, or if at all. If we are not able to successfully secure adequate arrangements for
	our commercial building and future homebuilding and home sales operations, then our business and results of operations will be
	materially and adversely affected.




	 





	Residential
	homebuilding is a competitive industry, and competitive conditions may adversely affect our results of operations.





	 




	The
	residential homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Residential homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers, but also for
	desirable properties, building materials, labor and capital. We compete for our property acquisition opportunities with other
	local, regional and national homebuilders, often within larger communities designed, planned and developed by such homebuilders.
	Any improvement in the cost structure or service of these competitors will increase the competition we face. Additionally, the
	resale of existing homes including foreclosed homes, sales by housing speculators and investors and rental housing may affect
	the amount of revenue in which we participate with the homebuilders we select for the development of residential lots should the
	additional parcels be acquired. Competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in: difficulty in acquiring suitable
	land at acceptable prices; increased selling incentives; lower sales volumes and prices; lower profit margins; impairments in
	the value of our inventory and other assets.




	 





	General
	Risks Associated with Investment in Real Estate





	 




	The
	investments of the Company will be subject to the risks generally incident to ownership of real property, including, but not limited
	to uncertainty of cash flow to meet fixed and other obligations; adverse changes in local employment conditions, interest rates
	and real estate tax rates; changes in fiscal policies; and uninsured losses and other risks that are beyond the control of the
	Company. There can be no assurance of profitable operations because the cost of owning real estate assets may exceed the income
	produced, particularly since certain expenses related to real estate and its development and ownership, such as property taxes,
	utility costs, maintenance costs and insurance, tend to increase over time and are largely beyond the control of the owner.




	 





	Difficulty
	in retaining qualified trades workers, or obtaining required materials and supplies, will adversely affect our business and results
	of operations.





	 




	The
	commercial and homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties in the supply of materials and
	services, including with respect to: shortages of qualified trades people; labor disputes; shortages of building materials; unforeseen
	environmental and engineering problems; and increases in the cost of certain materials (particularly increases in the price of
	lumber, wall board and cement, which are significant components of home construction costs). When any of these difficulties occur,
	it will cause delays and increase the cost of constructing the homes or other properties in our projects, thereby adversely affecting
	the revenue we receive from, commercial, home or other builders we participate with on sales of finished residences or commercial
	improvements on the properties.

	Tax
	law changes in the United States could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive.





	 




	Tax
	law changes in the United States could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive. In the United States, significant
	expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, generally are deductible expenses for an
	individual’s federal and, in some cases, state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy.
	If the federal government or a state government changes income tax laws to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax
	deductions, then the after-tax cost of owning a new home would increase substantially. This could adversely impact demand for,
	and/or sales prices of, new homes.




	 






	Risks
	Relating to This Offering






	 





	The
	offering price of the Shares has been arbitrarily determined and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator
	of the fair market value of the Shares.





	 




	Currently
	there is no public market for the Company’s common stock. The offering price for the Shares has been arbitrarily determined and
	does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets, operations, book or other established criteria of value of the
	Company. Thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the Shares.




	 





	There
	has been no prior public market for the Company’s common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the Shares
	difficult.





	 




	No
	prior public market has existed for the Company’s securities and the Company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop
	subsequent to this offering. The Company intends to apply for quotation of its common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. However,
	the Company does not know if it will be successful in such application, how long such application will take, or, if successful,
	that a market for the common stock will ever develop or continue on that or any other trading market. If for any reason a trading
	market for the Shares does not develop, investors may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so.

	Company’s election not to opt out of JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily
	comparable to other companies.





	 




	Pursuant
	to the JOBS Act of 2012, as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for
	any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of
	such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for
	public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This
	may not make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth
	company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as
	possible different or revised standards may be used.




	 





	The
	Company’s stock may be considered a penny stock and any investment in the Company’s stock will be considered a high-risk
	investment and subject to restrictions on marketability.





	 




	If
	the Shares commence trading, the trading price of the Company’s common stock may be below $5.00 per Share. If the price of the
	common stock is below such level, trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection
	with any trades generally involving any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per Share, subject
	to certain exceptions. Such rules require the delivery, before any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining
	the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith, and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who
	sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions). For these types
	of transactions, the broker-dealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s
	written consent to the transactions before sale. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage
	broker-dealers from effecting transactions in the Company’s common stock which could impact the liquidity of the Company’s
	common stock.




	 





	FINRA
	sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.





	 




	In
	addition to the “penny stock” rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (see above for a discussion
	of penny stock rules), FINRA rules require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable
	grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities
	to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial
	status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there
	is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements
	make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability
	to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.




	 





	Little
	Experience in Being a Public Company





	 




	The
	Company is an early-stage company and as such has little experience in managing a public company. Such lack of experience may
	result in the Company experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business. Further, the Company may be hampered
	by lack of experience in addressing the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies. If the Company’s
	operating or management abilities consistently perform below expectations, the Company’s business is unlikely to thrive.

	Table of Contents

	 




	The
	Company is an early-stage company with no developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public
	company require a structured and developed finance and accounting group. As a reporting company, the Company is already subject
	to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, the requirements of these laws and the rules and
	regulations promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive
	to the Company as it develops its business plan, services and scope. These costs have made, and will continue to make, some activities
	more difficult, time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel, systems and resources.




	 




	The
	Securities Exchange Act requires, among other things, that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and
	internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal
	control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required. As a result, management’s
	attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the Company’s
	business, financial condition and results of operations.




	 




	These
	rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain director and officer liability insurance.
	If the Company is unable to obtain adequate director and officer insurance, its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers
	and directors, especially those directors who may be deemed independent, will be significantly curtailed.




	 





	The
	Board of Directors could use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the Company
	that may otherwise be beneficial to some shareholders.





	 




	The
	Company is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance
	of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance
	of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder
	to block such a transaction, or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage
	vote of the stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the
	voting power of the holders of the common stock. Although the Company’s board of directors is required to make any determination
	to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, the board of
	directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of
	the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock
	over the then market price of such stock. The board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance
	of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or otherwise.




	 





	Limited
	Transferability of Shares





	 




	There
	is no public market for the Shares. While the Company intends to develop a public market in the future, there can be no assurance
	if or when such a market would be expected to develop in the future. Even if a potential buyer could be found, the transferability
	of these Shares is also restricted by the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 144 promulgated thereunder.
	Unless an exemption is available, these Shares may not be sold or transferred without registration under the Securities Act of
	1933, as amended.




	 




	Investors
	must be capable of bearing the economic risks of this investment with the understanding that these Shares may not be liquidated
	by resale or redemption and should expect to hold their Shares as a long-term investment (especially if no public trading market
	develops).





	 






	Speculative
	Nature of Investment





	 




	Investment
	in these Shares is speculative and, by investing, each investor assumes the risk of losing the entire investment. The Company
	has limited operations as of the date of this prospectus and will be solely dependent upon the Company and the Company’s plan
	of operation, both of which are subject to the risks described herein. Accordingly, only investors who are able to bear the loss
	of their entire should consider purchasing these Shares. 




	 





	No
	Expectation to Pay Dividends





	 




	The
	Company has not paid any dividends with respect to its outstanding Shares and cannot predict when, or if, dividends will be paid.
	The Company does not currently anticipate paying any dividends on the Shares until a product is successfully commercialized and
	liquidity is realized. There is no guarantee the Company will ever receive any profit from its operations so as to be able to
	declare and pay dividends. There can be no assurance with respect to the amount and timing of any dividends other than to the
	shareholders, or that they will ever be made. Future dividends will be determined by the Management of the Company in light of
	prevailing financial conditions, earnings, if any, as well as other relevant factors.




	 





	Unforeseen
	Changes





	 




	While
	the Company has enumerated certain material risk factors herein, it is impossible to know all risks which may arise in the future.
	In particular, shareholders may be negatively affected by changes in any of the following: (i) laws, rules and regulations; (ii)
	regional, national and/or global economic factors; (iii) the capacity, circumstances and relationships of partners of the Company
	or the Management; or (iv) general changes in financial or capital markets.




	 




	The
	Company continuously encounters changes in its operating environment, and the Company may have fewer resources than many of its
	competitors to continue to adjust to those changes. The operating environment of the Company is undergoing rapid changes, with
	frequent introductions of laws, regulations, competitors, market approaches, and economic impacts. Future success will depend,
	in part, upon the ability of the Company to adapt to those changes and providing products and services that will satisfy the demands
	of their respective businesses and projects. Many of the competitors have substantially greater resources to adapt to those changes.
	The Company may not effectively react to all of the changes in its operating environment or be successful in adapting its products
	and approach.

	FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS





	 




	This
	prospectus contains, in addition to historical information, certain information, assumptions and discussions that may constitute
	forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to
	differ materially than those projected or anticipated. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
	statements. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company
	cannot assure an investor that the forward-looking statements set out in this prospectus will prove to be accurate.




	 




	Such
	“forward-looking statements” can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes”,
	“expects”, “may”, “should” or “anticipates”, or the negative thereof, or other
	variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussion of strategy. No assurance can be given that the future results
	covered by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. The following matters constitute cautionary statements identifying
	important factors with respect to such forward-looking statements, including certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause
	actual results to vary materially from the future results covered in such forward-looking statements.




	 




	An
	investor should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected
	in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. The Company is not under a duty to update any of these forward-looking
	statements after the date of this prospectus or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.




	 







	DETERMINATION
	OF OFFERING PRICE





	 




	There
	is no public market for the Company’s common stock and the $0.25 price at which the Shares are being offered has been arbitrarily
	determined by the Company.




	 




	The
	Shares offered by the selling shareholders may be offered and sold, from time to time, by the selling shareholders described in
	this prospectus under the heading “Selling Shareholders” at an offering price of $0.25 per share until such time as
	the Shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and only thereafter may be offered at prevailing market or privately negotiated
	prices. The selling shareholders may sell the Shares by any means described in this prospectus under “Plan of Distribution.”





	 









	DIVIDEND
	POLICY





	 




	The
	Company does not anticipate that it will declare dividends in the foreseeable future but rather intends to use any future earnings
	for the development of its business.





	 









	SELLING
	SHAREHOLDERS





	 




	The
	Company is registering for offer and sale by existing holders thereof 4,938,535 shares of common stock held by such shareholders
	(“Selling Shareholder Shares”). The Selling Shareholder Shares were sold to the Selling Shareholders between April
	20, 2016 and March 14, 2017, pursuant to a private placement. Each Selling Shareholder paid between $0.10 and $0.20 per share.
	The Company will not receive any portion or percentage of any of the proceeds from the sale of the Selling Shareholder Shares.
	The selling shareholders have no agreement with any underwriters with respect to the sale of the Selling Shareholder Shares. The
	Selling Shareholders, who are deemed to be statutory underwriters, will offer their shares at a price of $0.25 per share, until
	such time as the Shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and offered thereafter at prevailing market or privately negotiated
	prices including (without limitation) in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary broker’s transactions, privately-negotiated
	transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing market if a market should develop.




	 




	Usual
	and customary or specifically negotiated brokerage fees or commissions may be paid by the selling shareholders in connection with
	sales of the common stock. The Selling Shareholders may from time to time offer their shares through underwriters, brokers-dealers,
	agents or other intermediaries. The distribution of the common stock by the Selling Shareholders may be effected in one or more
	transactions that may take place through customary brokerage channels, in privately negotiated sales; by a combination of these
	methods; or by other means.




	 




	The
	Selling Shareholders may from time to time offer the Selling Shareholder Shares through underwriters, dealers or agents, which
	may receive compensation in the form of underwriting discounts, concessions or commissions from them and/or the purchasers of
	the Selling Shareholder Shares for whom they may act as agents. Any agents, dealers or underwriters that participate in the distribution
	of the Selling Shareholder Shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” under the Securities Act and any discounts, commissions
	or concessions received by any such underwriters, dealers or agents might be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions
	under the Securities Act.

	PLAN
	OF DISTRIBUTION






	 





	This
	prospectus relates to the resale of up to 4,938,535 shares of our common stock by the Selling Shareholders.





	 





	The
	Selling Shareholders, and any of their pledgees, donees, assignees and other successors-in-interest may, from time to time sell
	any or all of their shares of common stock on any stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded, when
	and if traded, or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. The Selling Shareholders may use
	any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:





	 







	 




	●




	ordinary
	brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits the purchaser;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	block
	trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block
	as principal;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	facilitate
	the transaction;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	purchases
	by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	an
	exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	privately
	negotiated transactions;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	broker-dealers
	may agree with the Selling Shareholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	through
	the writing of options on the shares






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	a
	combination of any such methods of sale; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	any
	other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.







	 





	The
	Selling Shareholders, as applicable, shall have the sole and absolute discretion not to accept any purchase offer or make any
	sale of shares if it deems the purchase price to be unsatisfactory at any particular time.





	 





	The
	Selling Shareholders may also sell the shares directly to market makers acting as principals and/or broker-dealers acting as agents
	for themselves or their customers. Such broker-dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions
	from the Selling Shareholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agents or to whom they sell
	as principal or both, which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer might be in excess of customary commissions. Market
	makers and block purchasers purchasing the shares will do so for their own account and at their own risk. It is possible that
	the Selling Shareholders will attempt to sell shares of common stock in block transactions to market makers or other purchasers
	at a price per share which may be below the then existing market price. We cannot assure that all or any of the shares offered
	in this prospectus will be sold by the Selling Shareholders. The Selling Shareholders, and any broker-dealers or agents, upon
	completing the sale of any of the shares offered in this prospectus, may be deemed to be “underwriters” as that term
	is defined under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of such acts. In such event, any commissions
	received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting
	commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.





	 





	The
	Selling Shareholders, alternatively, may sell all or any part of the shares offered in this prospectus through an underwriter.
	The Selling Shareholders have not entered into any agreement with a prospective underwriter and there is no assurance that any
	such agreement will be entered into.





	 





	The
	Selling Shareholders may pledge its shares to its brokers under the margin provisions of customer agreements. If any of the Selling
	Shareholders default on a margin loan, the broker may, from time to time, offer and sell the pledged shares. The Selling Shareholders
	and any other persons participating in the sale or distribution of the shares will be subject to applicable provisions of the
	Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations under such act, including, without limitation, Regulation M. These provisions may
	restrict certain activities of, and limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the shares by any of the Selling Shareholders,
	or any other such person. Under Regulation M, persons engaged in a distribution of securities are prohibited from simultaneously
	engaging in market making and certain other activities with respect to such securities for a specified period of time prior to
	the commencement of such distributions, subject to specified exceptions or exemptions. All of these limitations may affect the
	marketability of the shares.





	 





	The
	Selling Shareholders will be offering such shares for its own account. We do not know for certain how or when the Selling Shareholders
	will choose to sell its shares of common stock. However, it can sell such shares at any time or through any manner set forth in
	this plan of distribution.





	 





	To
	permit the Selling Shareholders to resell the shares of common stock issued to it, we agreed to file a registration statement,
	of which this prospectus is a part, and all necessary amendments and supplements with the SEC for the purpose of registering and
	maintaining the registration of the shares. We will bear all costs relating to the registration of the common stock offered by
	this prospectus, other than the costs of our independent legal review. We will keep the registration statement effective until
	the earlier of (i) the date after which all of the shares of common stock held by the Selling Shareholders that are covered by
	the registration statement have been sold by the Selling Shareholders pursuant to such registration statement and (ii) the first
	day of the month next following the 36-month anniversary of the date the registration statement, to which this prospectus is made
	a part, is declared effective by the SEC.





	 






	Resale
	of the Securities under State Securities Laws






	 





	The
	National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996 (“NSMIA”) limits the authority of states to impose restrictions upon
	resale of securities made pursuant to Sections 4(1) and 4(3) of the Securities Act of companies which file reports under Sections
	13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act. Resale of the Shares in the secondary market will be made pursuant to Section 4(1)
	of the Securities Act (sales other than by an issuer, underwriter or broker).

	DESCRIPTION
	OF SECURITIES






	 







	Capitalization





	 




	Pursuant
	to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and amendments thereto, the Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of common
	stock, par value $0.0001, of which 57,771,868 shares were issued and outstanding as of the date of the registration statement,
	of which this prospectus is a part. The Company is also authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001,
	of which no shares are designated, issued or outstanding.




	 





	Common
	Stock





	 




	The
	Company is registering 4,938,535 shares of common stock offered for sale to the public by the holders thereof (selling shareholders)
	at an offering price of $0.25 per share. The selling shareholders will offer the Shares at $0.25 until such time as the Shares
	are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and offered thereafter by the selling shareholders at prevailing market or privately negotiated
	prices including (without limitation) in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary broker’s transactions, privately-negotiated
	transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing market prices if a market should develop.




	 




	Holders
	of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of
	common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. In addition to any vote required by law, the consent of at least a majority
	of the holders of the then-outstanding shares of common stock is required to (i) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any share
	of common stock, (ii) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of common
	stock; or (iii) amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company if such amendment would change any of the rights, preferences
	or privileges of the common stock.




	 




	Subject
	to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to
	share ratably in dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors in its discretion from funds
	legally available therefore. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, subject to the rights of the shares of
	preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to share pro rata all assets remaining after payment in full of all
	liabilities.




	 




	Holders
	of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the Company’s common stock. There are no conversion or redemption
	rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock. The Company may issue additional shares of common stock which
	could dilute its current shareholder’s share value.




	 





	Preferred
	Stock





	 




	Shares
	of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as may be determined by the board of directors. The board
	of directors may fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications,
	limitations or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the stockholders of the Company, except that no holder
	of preferred stock shall have preemptive rights. Any shares of preferred stock so issued would typically have priority over the
	common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. Any future issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying,
	deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect
	the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock.




	 




	At
	present, the Company has no plans to issue any preferred stock or adopt any series, preferences or other classification of preferred
	stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage
	an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination
	by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction, or facilitate a business combination
	by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances,
	the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock.




	 




	Although
	the Company’s board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment
	as to the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage
	an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests
	or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock. The board of directors
	does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise
	required by law or otherwise.

	MARKET
	FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS





	 





	Market
	Information





	 




	There
	is no public trading market for our common stock and a regular trading market may not develop, or if developed, may not be sustained.
	Unless and until a trading market exists, a stockholder in all likelihood will not be able to resell his or her securities should
	he or she desire to do so. While we will endeavor to have our common stock listed for trading on the OTC Markets (OTCQB), there
	is no assurance that we will be able to do so. We have no current proposals, arrangements, or understandings with any person with
	regard to the development of a trading market in our common stock.




	 




	The
	process for listing a company’s shares for trading on the OTCQB is a lengthy one. The process requires a market maker to
	file a listing application with FINRA on our behalf. The application is reviewed by FINRA and may or may not be approved. The
	process of seeking OTCQB listing can take 60 days or more to complete and any listing is contingent on FINRA approving our application.
	If our application is approved, FINRA will assign us a trading symbol which will then become listed and quoted on the OTCQB. Being
	listed on the OTCQB will facilitate buyers and sellers to consummate purchases and sales of our stock as well as allowing the
	market price to adjust to reflect current valuations of our business. We do not anticipate engaging a market maker to initiate
	the OTCQB listing application until this offering has been completed.





	 







	Conflict
	of Interest





	 




	The
	current officer and director of the Company shall devote full-time to the Company. If a specific business opportunity becomes
	available, such person may face a conflict in selecting between our business interest and their other business interests. The
	policy of the Board is that any personal business or corporate opportunity incurred by an officer or director of the Company must
	be examined by the Board and turned down by the Board in a timely basis before an officer or director can engage or take advantage
	of a business opportunity which could result in a conflict of interest.




	 




	On
	June 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Membership Unit Purchase Agreement with Patrick Liang, the president of the Company,
	pursuant to which the Company issued 2,833,333 units to Patrick at the price of $0.1 per unit in exchange for Mr. Liang’s
	real estate property, an undeveloped land, valued at $283,333. The real estate property is 28.98 acres, located at the city of
	Desert Hot Springs, County of Riverside, State of California.




	 




	On
	February 1, 2017, the Company entered into a lease for office space (the “Office Lease”) with Glory Investment International
	Inc. (“Glory Investment”), and our CEO’s mother is the CEO of Glory Investment. Pursuant to the Office Lease,
	the Company subleased 200 square feet office from Glory Investment, and the monthly rent of $500 is due within first five business
	days of each month. The term of the Office Lease is renewable from year-to-year. We believe that the rent is at or below market
	for the space we are occupying.




	 




	Other
	than as set forth above, none of the following parties has, since the date of incorporation, had any material interest, direct
	or indirect, in any transaction with the Company or in any presently proposed transaction that has or will materially affect us:




	 






	 




	●




	The
	officer and director;





	 


	 


	 





	 




	●




	Any
	person proposed as a nominee for election as a director;





	 


	 


	 





	 




	●




	Any
	person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to the outstanding
	shares of common stock;





	 


	 


	 





	 




	●




	Any
	relative or spouse of any of the foregoing persons who have the same house as such person.






	 




	As
	per the definition, a “promoter” is generally defined as anyone involved in the formation of the issuer. Mr. Liang
	who was involved in the formation of the Company, would be considered a “promoter.”




	 




	The
	term “promoter” includes: i) any person who, acting alone or in conjunction with one or more persons, directly or
	indirectly takes initiative in founding and organizing the business or enterprise of an issue; or ii) any person who, in connection
	with the founding and organizing of the business or enterprise of an issuer, directly or indirectly receives in consideration
	of services or property, or both services and property, 10 percent or more of any class securities of the issuer or 10 percent
	or more of the proceeds from the sale of any class of such securities. However, a person who receives such securities or proceeds
	either solely as underwriting commissions or solely in consideration of property shall not be deemed a promoter within the meaning
	of this paragraph, if such person does not otherwise take part in founding and organizing the enterprise.




	 




	Other
	than Mr. Liang, there are no promoters being used in relation with this offering. No persons who may, in the future, be considered
	a promoter will receive or expect to receive any assets, services or other consideration from the Company. No assets will be or
	are expected to be acquired from any promoter on behalf of the Company.




	 





	Penny
	Stock Regulations





	 




	Our
	common stock will be deemed to be “penny stock” as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of
	1934 to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Our shares thus will be subject to rules that impose sales practice
	and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock.




	 











	 



	13



	 







	Table of Contents

	 




	 




	Under
	the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited
	investor must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written
	consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt. Generally, an individual with a net
	worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually or $300,000 together with his or her spouse is
	considered an accredited investor. In addition, under the penny stock regulations the broker-dealer is required to:




	 




	Deliver,
	prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market,
	unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;




	 




	Disclose
	commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities;




	 




	Send
	monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer’s account, the account’s
	value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and




	 




	Make
	a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s
	written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer’s account.




	 




	Because
	of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to buy or sell shares of our common stock, which
	may affect the ability of selling stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect
	of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements
	could impede the sale of our common stock even if our common stock becomes publicly traded. In addition, the liquidity for our
	common stock may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our common stock. Our shares are likely to be subject
	to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future.




	 





	Common
	Stock Currently Outstanding





	 




	As
	of May 25, 2017, all of our currently outstanding shares consist of 57,771,868 shares of restricted common stock.




	 





	Holders





	 




	As
	of the date of this prospectus, we had 39 stockholders of record of our common stock.




	 





	Dividends





	 




	We
	have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the
	foreseeable future. We plan to retain future earnings, if any, for use in our business. Any decisions as to future payments of
	dividends will depend on our earnings and financial position and such other facts, as the Board of Directors deems relevant.




	 





	Reports
	to Stockholders





	 




	We
	are currently not subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 but will be following
	the effectiveness of this registration statement. At that time, we will file all necessary periodic reports, and other information
	with the SEC. We intend to send annual reports to our stockholders containing audited financial statements.





	 







	Transfer
	Agent





	 




	It
	is anticipated that West Coast Stock Transfer, Inc., Encinitas, California will be the registrar and transfer agent for our Common
	Stock.

	THE
	BUSINESS AND BUSINESS PLAN





	 





	Background





	 




	The
	Company is a development stage company and has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term.




	 





	Overview





	 




	The
	Company’s primary objective is commercial and residential land development, including the purchase and sale of real estate, targeting
	properties primarily in Southern California. We also intend to manage properties we own and properties owned by unaffiliated third
	parties. Our activities will include securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the
	properties, securing financing for purchase of the properties, improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities and
	selling the properties to homeowner and commercial owners for restaurants, offices and small businesses. Our first property acquisition
	was 29 acres in the city of Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners, rather
	than get involved in protracted negotiations, the Company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit.

	Company’s business strategy includes the following three main segments of the real estate business:




	 




	1.
	We intend to acquire and develop land for residential and commercial development.




	2.
	We also intend to develop a diversified real estate portfolio by investing in residential real estate, including single-family
	housing, condos and town-homes and commercial properties, including strip-malls and small office buildings.




	3.
	We intend to provide property management for our own properties and for properties owned by non-affiliated third parties.




	 







	Property
	Development





	 




	The
	Company intends to acquire land and develop and sell fully constructed homes and commercial property such as stores, offices,
	private schools, etc., to non-affiliated third parties. Our first property acquisition was 29 acres of vacant land in the city
	of Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Our original plan was to build various commercial buildings on the parcels, including
	stores and restaurants. However, due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners that would lead to lengthy negotiations
	and possibly additional costs, the Company sold the property in March 2017, to a non-affiliated third party for a profit.




	 




	Our
	principal activities are securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties,
	securing financing for the purchase of the properties, improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities, and selling
	properties to third parties. Currently all of our property development activities are centered in the Southern California area.




	 





	Investing
	in Development Projects





	 




	The
	Company intends to invest some of its funds and to utilize funds pooled from investors to directly invest in income-yielding properties.
	The Company will concentrate on investing in properties with long-term leases.




	 




	We
	rely on our management’s expertise in identifying residential and commercial real estate assets within our stated target
	objectives. Our Management makes investment decisions based on various factors, including, relative value, expected risk-adjusted
	returns, current and projected credit fundamentals, current and projected macroeconomic considerations, current and projected
	supply and demand, credit and market risk concentration limits, liquidity, cost of financing and financing availability, as well
	as maintaining our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act.




	 




	Our
	targeted asset classes and the principal investments we have made and expect to make in each are as follows:




	 









	Asset
	Class





	 





	Principal
	Investments







	Residential
	Property




	 




	●
	Single family attached, Single Family detached, multi-unit, condominiums, townhomes, etc.






	Partially
	completed real estate developments, residential, commercial, retail.




	 



	●

	  Acquisition
	and sale of vacant land






	 




	 




	 






	REO
	Tape Transactions




	 



	●  

	Bulk
	or block acquisitions of single family detached residential units or homes.







	 




	Our
	primary business strategy is to seek out and secure real estate properties that may have been formerly subjected to distressed
	financing terms as a consequence of recent economic factors. Our focus is on residential, single-family detached homes throughout
	Southern California made available individually or bulk transfer from various private parties or financial institutions seeking
	to liquidate non-performing assets.




	 




	Another
	business strategy is designed to generate a rate of return by acquiring distressed properties (individually or in bulk transaction(s))
	for investment purposes and eventual resale. We believe there is a significant market opportunity to acquire discounted real estate
	assets or in some instances, to lend to or invest with real estate developers and property owners or otherwise participate in
	real estate related investments where non-traditional financing sources are not available. The current credit crisis and economic
	environment and the strict underwriting standards and length of time required by traditional sources including banking institutions
	are often prohibitive.

	Property
	Management

	many cases we will manage our own properties and market our property management service to others. Property management involves
	most of the following duties




	 












	●




	Establishes
	rental rate by surveying local rental rates; calculating overhead costs, depreciation,
	taxes, and profit goals.

	We
	intend to market our properties through real estate brokers and agents coordinated by company marketing personnel. Our marketing
	efforts will target both international and local buyers and builders.




	 





	 

	Competition

	 



	 



	We
	believe there are only limited barriers to entry in our business. Current and future competitors may have more resources than
	we have. Our projects face competition generally from REITs, institutional pension plans and other public and private real estate
	companies and private real estate investors for the acquisition of properties and for raising capital. In transaction services,
	we face competition with other real estate firms in the acquisition and disposition of properties, and we also compete with other
	sponsors of real estate for investors to provide the capital to allow us to make these investments. We also compete against other
	real estate companies who may be chosen by a broker-dealer as an investment platform instead of us. In management services, we
	compete with other properties for viable investors for properties. We also believe that our broker dealers compete, or will compete,
	with institutions that provide or arrange for other types of financing through private or public offerings of equity or debt and
	from traditional bank financings.

	Real
	estate development is a highly competitive business. We compete with numerous developers, builders and others for the acquisition
	of property. As we attempt to expand our operations we will certainly be competing with other business ranging from large multinational
	corporations to small startup business such as ourselves. Many of our competitors may have longer operating histories, better
	brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. To successfully compete in our industry, we will need to: 




	 





	 



	●




	Ensure that investments in our projects are affordable;






	 




	 




	 





	 



	●




	That we only invest in properties in well-priced locations; 






	 




	 




	 





	 



	●




	That our investment strategy is simple to understand;
	and 






	 




	 




	 





	 



	●




	That we provide outstanding customer service and rigid
	integrity in our business dealings.






	 




	However,
	there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our
	industry. We believe that we have the required management expertise in sourcing properties with good development potential and
	affordable price. 




	 




	We
	are committed to work and communicate with our investors and sales consultants to identify their goals and needs which will make
	it easier to continually provide them with the best products and services. 




	 





	Government
	Regulations

	 




	 





	Real
	Property Development

	 




	 




	Land
	development permits and approvals are required to develop real property. These permits and approvals will vary depending on the
	land that is being developed. 




	 




	The
	commercial and residential real estate development industry is subject to substantial environmental, building, construction, zoning
	and real estate regulations that are imposed by various federal, state and local authorities. In developing a community, we must
	obtain the approval of numerous government agencies regarding such matters as permitted land uses, housing density, the installation
	of utility services (such as water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone and cable television) and the dedication of acreage for open
	space, parks, schools and other community purposes. Regulations affect commercial building and homebuilding by specifying, among
	other things, the type and quality of building materials that must be used, certain aspects of land use and building design and
	the manner in which homebuilders may conduct their sales, operations, and overall relationships with potential renters and buyers.
	Furthermore, changes in prevailing local circumstances or applicable laws may require additional approvals, or modifications of
	approvals previously obtained. These permits and approvals will vary depending on the land that is being developed. 




	 




	Timing
	of the initiation and completion of development projects depends upon receipt of necessary authorizations and approvals. Because
	of the provisional nature of these approvals and the concerns of various environmental and public interest groups, the approval
	process can be delayed by withdrawals or modifications of preliminary approvals and by litigation and appeals challenging development
	rights. Our ability to develop projects could be delayed or prevented due to litigation challenging previously obtained governmental
	approvals. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to
	building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future.
	Such delays could adversely affect our ability to complete our projects, significantly increase the costs of doing so or drive
	potential customers to purchase competitors’ products.




	 





	Management
	Services

	 




	 




	We
	and our brokers, salespersons and, in some instances, property managers are regulated by the states in which we do business. These
	regulations may include licensing procedures, prescribed professional responsibilities and anti-fraud provisions. Our activities
	are also subject to various local, state, national and international jurisdictions’ fair advertising, trade, housing and
	real estate settlement laws and regulations and are affected by laws and regulations relating to real estate and real estate finance
	and development. 




	 





	Environmental
	Compliance

	 




	 




	Federal,
	state and local laws and regulations impose environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, disclosure obligations and other
	restrictions that impact the management, development, use or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage
	sales and leasing activities with respect to some properties. If transactions in which we are involved are delayed or abandoned
	as a result of these restrictions, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, a failure by us to disclose environmental
	concerns to potential investors or third party buyers of the developed property may subject our company to liability and may adversely
	impact our business or cause us to incur costs for cleanup of hazardous substances or wastes or other environmental liabilities. 




	 




	Various
	environmental laws and regulations also can impose liability for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous or toxic
	substances at sites currently or formerly owned or operated by a party, or at off-site locations to which such party sent wastes
	for disposal. As a property manager, we could be held liable as an operator for any such contamination; even if the original activity
	was legal and we had no knowledge of, or did not cause, the release or contamination. Further, because liability under some of
	these laws is joint and several, we could be held responsible for more than our share, or even all, of the costs for such contaminated
	site if the other responsible parties are unable to pay. Similarly, we are generally obliged, under the debt financing arrangements
	on the properties owned by us, to provide an indemnity to the lenders for environmental liabilities and to remediate any environmental
	problems that might arise. Insurance for these matters may not always be available, or sufficient to cover our losses.

	Jumpstart
	Our Business Startups Act





	 




	In
	April, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among
	other things: Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to
	five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies; Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities
	laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting
	requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition
	for Rule 506 offerings; Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and
	Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules
	to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and such sales are exempt from state law registration,
	documentation or offering requirements. In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial
	public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was affected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than
	$1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging
	growth company after the earliest of




	 






	(i)




	the completion of the fiscal year in which the company
	has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,








	(ii)




	the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary
	of the company’s IPO;








	(iii)




	the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible
	debt in the prior three-year period; or








	(iv)




	the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer”
	as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.






	 




	The
	Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company will be affected by some of the changes provided in the JOBS Act and
	certain of the new exemptions. The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and
	for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.




	 





	Financial
	Disclosure.

	The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities
	Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:




	 






	(i)




	audited financial statements required for only two fiscal
	years;








	(ii)




	selected financial data required for only the fiscal
	years that were audited;








	(iii)




	executive compensation only needs to be presented in
	the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less
	than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter)






	 




	However,
	the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already
	provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company.




	 




	Currently
	a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs
	audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.




	 




	The
	JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the
	Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise
	required by SEC rule.




	 




	The
	JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s
	accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.




	 





	Internal
	Control Attestation.

	The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered
	public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the
	Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	Section
	102(a) of the JOBS Act goes on to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirements in 1934 Act § 14A(e) for companies
	with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.





	 






	Other
	Items of the JOBS Act.

	The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors
	that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either
	prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker
	or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision.
	In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers,
	dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth
	company IPO.

	Table of Contents

	 



	 



	Section
	106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided
	that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show.
	This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that
	it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to
	conduct a road show.





	 






	Election
	to Opt Out of Transition Period.

	Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to
	comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act
	registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to
	comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.




	 




	The
	JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply
	to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of
	the transition period.

	There
	are no pending, threatened or actual legal proceedings in which the Company is a party.

	MANAGEMENT’S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	 




	 

	You
	should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our
	audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion
	contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events
	could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those
	set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus





	 





	Overview





	 




	The
	Company is a development stage company and was incorporated in the State of Nevada in January 2016. The Company’s primary objective
	is commercial and residential land development, including the purchase and sale of real estate, targeting properties primarily
	in Southern California. We also intend to manage properties we own and properties owned by unaffiliated third parties. Our activities
	will include securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties, securing financing
	for purchase of the properties, improving the properties’ infrastructure and amenities and selling the properties to homeowner
	and commercial owners for restaurants, offices and small businesses. Our first property acquisition was 29 acres in the city of
	Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners, rather than get involved in protracted
	negotiations, the Company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit.




	 





	Development
	Stage and Capital Resources




	 



	Since
	its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning. Accordingly, the Company is considered
	to be in the development stage. In March, 2017, the Company generated its first revenues from the sale of vacant property in Desert
	Springs, California. There is no assurance of future revenues. 




	 




	There
	is no assurance that the Company’s activities will result in any operations or that any operations, if begun, will generate
	revenues. The Company will need additional capital, but there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such capital
	on terms satisfactory to the Company. Accordingly, given the Company’s limited cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company
	will be unable to implement its business plans and proposed operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is
	able to generate revenues and profits. The Company may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity, obtain loan financing
	or develop and consummate other alternative financial plans. 



	 




	Results
	of Operation for the Period from Inception to December 31, 2016




	 



	For
	the period from inception to December 31, 2016, the Company had earned no revenue nor realized any profits and incurred general
	and administrative expenses of $61,989. For the period from inception to December 31, 2016, our net loss was $61,989. As of December
	31, 2016, the Company had cash balance of $655,170.




	 





	Results
	of Operation for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and for the period from inception to March 31, 2016





	 




	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company generated $310,000 of revenues from sale of its land compared to $0 revenues
	for the period from inception to March 31, 2016. The corresponding cost of revenue was $283,333 and $0, respectively. During the
	three months ended March 31, 2017 and the period from inception to March 31, 2016, the Company incurred general and administrative
	expenses of $95,892 and $12, respectively. The general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 mainly
	included consulting expenses in the amount of $90,000 and other professional and legal fees relating to complying with the Company’s
	SEC reporting obligations and consulting fees of $2,509. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and for the period from inception
	to March 31, 2016, our net loss was $69,225 and $12, respectively. The increase in net loss was mainly due to the increase in
	general and administrative expense partially offset by increase in gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared
	to the period from inception to March 31, 2016.

	Equity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	We
	have incurred losses since inception of our business in 2016 and, as of March 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $131,214.
	As of March 31, 2017, we had cash of $910,076 and a working capital of $1,073,026, compared to cash of $655,170 and a working
	capital of $882,153 at December 31, 2016. The increase in the working capital was primarily due private placements and the sale
	of real property. 



	 



	The
	Company does not anticipate that it will generate revenue sufficient to cover its planned operating expenses in the foreseeable
	future, and the Company must obtain additional financing in order to develop and implement its business plan and proposed operations.
	If the Company is not successful in generating sufficient revenues and/or obtaining additional funding to develop its business
	plan and proposed operations, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations liquidity and financial
	condition. 




	 






	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements






	 




	Under
	SEC regulations, we are required to disclose off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
	or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
	liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. An off-balance sheet arrangement means a
	transaction, agreement or contractual arrangement to which any entity that is not consolidated with us is a party, under which
	we have:






	 








	 




	●




	Any
	obligation under certain guarantee contracts,






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Any
	retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit,
	liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets,






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Any
	obligation under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except that it is both indexed to our
	stock and classified in shareholder equity in our statement of financial position, and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Any
	obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity,
	market risk or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.






	 




	We
	do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations. In the ordinary
	course of business, we enter into operating lease commitments, and other contractual obligations. These transactions are recognized
	in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies






	 





	The
	financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States. The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
	of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are
	based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
	results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
	from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 




	 




	The
	critical accounting policies are discussed in further detail in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing
	elsewhere in this prospectus. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide
	useful and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial condition.

	Board
	Committees





	 





	Audit
	committee





	 




	We
	do not have a separately-designated standing audit committee. The Board of Directors performs the functions of an audit committee,
	but no written charter governs the actions of the Board of Directors when performing the functions that would generally be performed
	by an audit committee. The Board of Directors approves the selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with
	the independent accountants to discuss issues related to financial reporting. In addition, the Board of Directors reviews the
	scope and results of the audit with the independent accountants, reviews with management and the independent accountants our annual
	operating results, considers the adequacy of our internal accounting procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters
	including /fees to be paid to the independent auditor and the performance of the independent auditor.




	 





	Compensation
	and Nominations Committees





	 




	We
	currently have no compensation or nominating committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions. Currently, the
	member of our Board of Directors participates in discussions concerning executive officer compensation and nominations to the
	Board of Directors.




	 





	Code
	of Conduct and Ethics





	 




	We
	have not adopted a Code of Ethics, as required by sections 406 and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management believes
	that the size of our company and current operations at this time do not require a code of ethics to govern the behavior of our
	officer. We anticipate that we will adopt a code of ethics once we are in a position to do so.





	 






	Director
	Independence





	 




	Pursuant
	to Rule 4200 of The NASDAQ Stock Market, one of the definitions of an independent director is a person other than an executive
	officer or employee of a company. The Company has only one director, Ms. Guo, who may be considered an independent director.




	 





	Legal
	Proceedings

	DISCLOSURE
	OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES





	 




	The
	Company’s Certificate of Incorporation include an indemnification provision that provides that the Company shall indemnify
	directors against monetary damages to the Company or any of its shareholders by reason of a breach of the director’s fiduciary
	except (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Company or its shareholders or (ii) for acts or omissions
	not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct of (iii) for unlawful payment of dividend or unlawful stock purchase
	or redemption or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.




	 




	Pursuant
	to Section 607.0850 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, we have the power to indemnify any person made a party to any lawsuit by reason
	of being a director or officer of the Registrant, or serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee
	or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’
	fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action,
	suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
	of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
	unlawful. Our Bylaws provide that the Registrant shall indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by
	Nevada law.




	 




	The
	Articles of Incorporation does not specifically indemnify the officers or directors or controlling persons against liability under
	the Securities Act.




	 




	With
	regard to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
	such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and is, therefore, unenforceable.
	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid
	by a director, officer or controlling person of the Corporation in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is
	asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the common shares being registered, we will, unless
	in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by a controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
	the question of whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
	and will be governed by the final adjudication of such case.

	Report
	of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm





	 




	To
	the Board of Directors and Stockholders




	Forge
	Innovation Development Corp.




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Forge Innovation Development Corp. as of December 31, 2016 and the related statements
	of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the period from January 15, 2016 (Date of inception) to
	December 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is
	to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
	material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
	control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as
	a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
	on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An
	audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
	the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
	the financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forge
	Innovation Development Corp. at December 31, 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from January
	15, 2016 (Date of inception) to December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America.

	Notes to the financial statements






	 






	Note 1 - Organization and Description
	of Business




	 



	Forge Innovation Development Corp.,
	or the “Company”, was initially incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 15, 2016 under the name of You-Go enterprises,
	LLC (the “Company Predecessor”). On November 3, 2016, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation
	in the State of Nevada to change the Company’s name to Forge Innovation Development Corp. Our principle executive office
	is located at 17700 Castleton Street, Suite 469 City of Industry, CA 91748. Tel: 626-361-1393. The Company’s main business
	will be focus on property development, investing in development projects, the purchase and sale of real estate and property management.



	 



	The Company has elected December
	31 as its year end.



	 





	Development Stage Company





	 



	The Company is considered to be in the development stage
	as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) ASC 915, “Development Stage Entities”. The Company
	has devoted substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business and for which either of the following conditions exists:
	planned principal operations have not commenced; or the planned principal operations have commenced, but there has been no significant
	revenue there from.  Due to the Company’s primary efforts was on the formation of new company, and there were no
	sales activities incurred, accordingly, the Company is considered as development stage entity. 



	 




	Note 2 - Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies




	 





	Basis of Presentation





	 



	This summary of significant accounting
	policies is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. These accounting policies conform to accounting
	principles, generally accepted in the United States of America, and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial
	statements.



	 





	Use of Estimates





	 



	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary
	in order to make the financial statements not misleading have been included. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	Signiant estimates are used in valuing the fair value of common stock issued for services, among others.



	 





	Revenue Recognition





	 



	In recognizing revenue from land
	sales, the Company follows the provisions in Accounting Standards Codification 976, or ASC 976, “Real Estate – Retail
	Land” to record the sales. ASC 976 provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can
	be recorded. For example, ASC 976 requires a land sale to be consummated with a sufficient buyer’s initial and continuing
	investment of at least 20% to 25% of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold,
	and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination. In addition, the seller cannot retain any material
	continuing involvement in the property sold or be required to develop the property in the future.



	 





	Cash and Cash Equivalents





	 



	The Company considers all highly
	liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
	at December 31, 2016 were $655,170, representing cash deposited in bank.



	 





	Real Estate Investment





	 



	Real Estate Investment is recorded
	at cost. Cost represents the purchase price of the asset and other costs incurred to bring the asset into its existing use. All
	costs related to the improvement or replacement of real estate properties are capitalized. Additions, renovations and improvements
	that enhance and/or extend the useful life of a property are also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance, repairs and
	improvements that do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred.



	 





	Income Taxes





	 



	The Company accounts for income
	taxes under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.”  Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and
	liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying
	amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
	using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
	be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
	the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not
	that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.

	Basic Earnings (Loss) Per
	Share




	 


	The Company computes basic and diluted
	earnings per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing
	net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting
	period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue
	common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of
	the Company.


	 


	The Company does not have any potentially
	dilutive instruments as of December 31, 2016 and, thus, anti-dilution issues are not applicable.


	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 


	The Company’s balance sheet
	includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value
	because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.


	 


	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements
	and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an
	exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
	on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant
	assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s
	own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable
	inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices
	in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three
	levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:


	 




	 



	●	



	Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the
	measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.




	 


	 


	 




	 



	●	



	Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for
	the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;
	quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that
	are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated

	Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.




	 


	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon
	certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2016. The respective carrying value
	of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
	These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalent.


	 






	Operating Leases




	 


	Leases where substantially all the rewards and risks
	of ownership of assets remain with the leasing company are accounted for as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases
	are charged to the statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease period.


	 




	Related Parties




	 


	The Company follows ASC 850,

	Related
	Party Disclosures,

	for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.


	 




	Share-based Compensation




	 


	ASC 718, “

	Compensation –
	Stock Compensation

	”, prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which
	employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and
	other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees,
	including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair
	values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the
	award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).

	The Company accounts for stock-based
	compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, “

	Equity –
	Based Payments to Non-Employees.”

	 Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based
	on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments
	issued.  The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date
	or performance completion date.


	 


	The company had no stock-based compensation
	plans December 31, 2016.


	 




	Impairment of long-lived assets




	 


	Long-lived assets are tested for impairment in accordance
	with ASC 360-10-45 “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. The Company periodically evaluates potential impairment
	whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If circumstances
	require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows
	expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset
	group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value
	exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted
	market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized
	for the years ended December 31, 2016.


	 




	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements




	 


	The Company has implemented all
	new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are
	any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position and result
	of operations.


	 



	Note 3 - Income Taxes



	 


	The Company has not recognized an
	income tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income
	in future periods. The tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax
	assets arising from the net operating losses, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In future
	periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts
	to be more likely than not. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards
	for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating
	loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, the Company
	has incurred a net loss of approximately $61,989 which resulted in a net operating loss for income tax purposes. NOLs begin expiring
	in 2036. The loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately $21,076 at the effective statutory rate of 34%. The deferred
	tax asset has been off-set by an equal valuation allowance.

	The Company may from time to time
	be assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions.  In the event it receives an assessment for interest and/or
	penalties, it will be classified in the financial statements as tax expense.

	The Company follows ASC 450-20,
	Loss Contingencies, to report accounting for contingencies.  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments,
	litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
	of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.

	Notes to the unaudited financial
	statements




	 





	Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business



	 


	Forge Innovation Development Corp.,
	or the “Company”, was initially incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 15, 2016 under the name of You-Go enterprises,
	LLC (the “Company Predecessor”). On November 3, 2016, the Company filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation
	in the State of Nevada to change the Company’s name to Forge Innovation Development Corp. Our principle executive office
	is located at 17700 Castleton Street, Suite 469 City of Industry, CA 91748. Tel: 626-361-1393. The Company’s main business
	will be focus on real estate development, land purchasing and selling and property management.


	 


	The Company has elected December
	31 as its year end.


	 




	Development Stage Company


	 


	 


	The Company is considered to be
	in the development stage as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) ASC 915, “Development Stage Entities”.
	The Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business and for which either of the following conditions
	exists: planned principal operations have not commenced; or the planned principal operations have commenced, but there has been
	no significant revenue there from.  The Company’s first revenues were in March 2017 from the sale of real estate
	in Desert Springs, California. There were no sales activities from commercial or residential land development or from real estate
	management services as of March 31, 2017.  There is no assurance of any future revenues.


	 




	Basis of Presentation


	  


	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim
	financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
	statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s most recent Annual Financial Statements filed with the SEC on Form
	S-1. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation
	of financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented have been reflected herein. The results of
	operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the
	financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the
	most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form S-1, have been omitted. 


	 



	Note 2 - Income Taxes



	 


	The Company has not recognized an
	income tax benefit for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income
	in future periods. The tax benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax
	assets arising from the net operating losses, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In future
	periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts
	to be more likely than not. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards
	for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating
	loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years. 


	 


	As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, the
	Company has incurred a net loss of $131,214 and $12 which resulted in a net operating loss for income tax purposes. NOLs begin
	expiring in 2036. The loss results in a deferred tax asset of approximately $44,612 and $4 at the effective statutory rate of 34%.
	The deferred tax asset has been off-set by an equal valuation allowance.

	The Company has evaluated and concluded
	that there are no significant uncertain tax positions required recognition in its financial statements.


	 


	The Company may from time to time
	be assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions.  In the event it receives an assessment for interest and/or
	penalties, it will be classified in the financial statements as tax expense.


	 



	Note 3 - Concentration of Risk



	 


	The Company maintains cash in one
	account within one local commercial bank located in Southern California. The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositors
	under the FDIC’s general deposit insurance rules. At December 31, 2016, uninsured cash balances in any domestic U.S. financial
	institution is $662,826.

	On February 1, 2017, the Company
	entered into a lease for office space (the “Office Lease”) with Glory Investment International Inc. (“Glory Investment”),
	and our CEO’s mother is the CEO of Glory Investment. Pursuant to the Office Lease, the Company subleased 200 square feet
	office from Glory Investment, and the monthly rent of $500 is due within first five business days of each month. The term of the
	Office Lease is renewable from year-to-year. We believe that the rent is at or below market for the space we are occupying. For
	the three months ended and as of March 31, 2017, rent expense and rent payable was $1,000.


	 



	Note 5 - Shareholder Equity



	 


	In January 2017, the Company issued
	700,340 shares of its $0.0001 par value common stock at the price of $0.2 per share to four investors for $140,068 in cash.  


	 


	In February 2017, the Company issued
	600,150 shares of its $0.0001 par value common stock at the price of $0.2 per share to two investors for $120,030 in cash.


	 



	Note 6 –Notes Receivable



	 


	On March 17, 2017, the Company entered
	into a Land Transaction Agreement with Steven Zhi Qin, a third party individual, Pursuant to which, the Company sold the undeveloped
	land located in Desert Hot Spring with value of $283,333, to Steven Zhi Qin in exchange for a Promissory Note in the amount of
	$310,000. The Promissory Note will be due on March 17, 2018, with interest at the rate of 2% per annum, payable in monthly installment

	1715 East Cortez Street, West Covina, CA 91791 as additional collateral, of which a lien will be recorded against said property.


	 



	Note 7 - Commitments and
	Contingencies 



	 


	The Company follows ASC 450-20,

	Los

	s

	Contingencies,

	to report accounting for contingencies.  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from
	claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been
	incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.


	 




	Advisory Agreement




	 


	On November 05, 2016, the Company
	entered into a Consulting Agreement with Speedlight Consulting Services Inc. (the “Consultant”), pursuant to which

	Item
	17. Undertakings






	 





	(a)
	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: 




	 




	(1)
	to file, during any period in which it offers or sells securities are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration
	Statement to:




	 




	(i)
	include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;




	 




	(ii)
	reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this registration statement (or the most recent
	post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set
	forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if
	the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high
	end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
	424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering
	price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and




	 




	(iii)
	include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement
	or any material change to such information in the registration statement; provided, however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)
	of this rule do not apply if the registration statement is on Form S-8, and the information required to be included in a post-effective
	amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to
	section 13 or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement; and paragraphs
	(a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if the registration statement is on Form S-3 or Form F-3 and
	the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or
	furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated
	by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is not
	part of the registration statement.




	 




	Provided
	further, however, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) do not apply if the registration statement is for an offering of asset-backed
	securities on Form S-1 or Form S-3, and the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment is provided pursuant
	to item 1100(c) of Regulation AB.




	 




	(2)
	For determining liability under the Securities Act, treat each post-effective amendment as a new registration statement of the
	securities offered, and the offering of the securities at that time to be the initial bona fide offering.




	 




	(3)
	File a post-effective amendment to remove from registration any of the securities that remain unsold at the end of the offering.




	 




	(b)
	For determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities,
	the registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the registrant pursuant to this registration statement,
	regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such
	purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered
	to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:




	 




	(1)
	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;




	 




	(2)
	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the registrant or used or referred to by the
	registrant;




	 




	(3)
	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the registrant
	or its securities provided by or on behalf of the registrant; and




	 




	(4)
	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the registrant to the purchaser.




	 




	(c)
	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
	persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
	and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
	or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
	is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant
	will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
	jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will
	be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the
	date the prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and




	 




	(ii)
	Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance
	on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information
	required by section 10(a) of the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of
	the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of
	securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any
	person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement
	relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities
	at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration
	statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by
	reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with
	a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement
	or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date;
	or




	 




	If
	the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating
	to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A,
	shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness.
	Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of a registration statement or
	made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part
	of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify
	any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in
	any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.




	 




	If
	the registrant is relying on Rule 430A:




	 




	(i)
	For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed
	as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant
	pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement
	as of the time it was declared effective.




	 




	(ii)
	For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus
	shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities
	at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

	OFFICES




	 




	1.1       

	Business
	Office

	. The principal office and place of business of the corporation is located in the State of California, at 17700 Castleton
	St., Suite 469, City of Industry, CA 91748. Other offices and places of business may be established from time to time by resolution
	of the Board of Directors or as the business of the corporation may require.




	 




	1.2       

	Registered
	Office and Registered Agent

	. The registered agent of the corporation for the service of process in the state of Nevada is
	Incorp Services, Inc. and the registered office of the registered agent for the service of process is 3773 Howard Hughes Pkwy,
	Ste. 500S, Las Vegas, NV 89169.




	 




	1.3       The
	registered agent of the corporation may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors in accordance with the procedures
	set forth in the Nevada Business Corporation Act.




	 




	ARTICLE
	II




	SHARES
	AND TRANSFER THEREOF




	 




	2.1       

	Regulation

	.
	The Board of Directors may make such rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate concerning the issuance, transfer, and registration
	of certificates for shares of the corporation, including the appointment of transfer agents and registrars.




	 




	2.2       

	Stock
	Certificates: Facsimile Signatures and Validation

	.




	 




	(A)       Every
	stockholder shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by officers or agents designated by the corporation for the purpose,
	certifying the number of shares owned by him in the corporation.




	 




	(B)       Whenever
	any certificate is countersigned or otherwise authenticated by a transfer agent or transfer clerk, and by a registrar, then a
	facsimile of the signatures of the officers or agents of the corporation may be printed or lithographed upon such certificate
	in lieu of the actual signatures.




	 




	(C)       In
	the event any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature shall have been used on, any certificate
	or certificates for stock shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation, whether because of death, resignation
	or other reason, before such certificate or certificates shall have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate or certificates
	may nevertheless be adopted by the corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate
	or certificates, or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon, had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the
	corporation.




	 




	2.3       

	Fractions
	of Shares: Issuance; Payment of Value or Issuance of Scrip

	. The corporation is not obligated to, but may, execute and deliver
	a certificate for or including a fraction share. In lieu of executing and delivering a certificate for a fraction of a share,
	the corporation may, upon resolution of the Board of Directors:




	 




	(A)       make
	payment to any person otherwise entitled to become a holder of a fractional share, which payment shall be in accordance with the
	provisions of the Nevada Business Corporation Act; or




	 




	(B)       issue
	such additional fraction of a share as is necessary to increase the fractional share to a full share; or




	 




	(C)       execute
	and deliver registered or bearer scrip over the manual or facsimile signature of an officer of the corporation or of its agent
	for that purpose, exchangeable as provided on the scrip for full share certificates, but the scrip does not entitle the holder
	to any rights as a stockholder except as provided on the scrip. The scrip may contain any other provisions or conditions, as permitted
	by the Nevada Business Corporation Act, which the corporation, by resolution of the Board of Directors, deems advisable.




	 




	2.4       

	Cancellation
	of Outstanding Certificates and Issuance of New Certificates: Order of Surrender; Penalties for Failure to Comply

	. All certificates
	surrendered to the corporation for transfer shall be canceled and no new certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof until the
	former certificate for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and canceled, except as hereinafter provided with respect
	to lost, stolen or destroyed certificates.




	 











	Bylaws of Forge Innovation Development Corp.


	Page

	1















	 




	When
	the Articles of Incorporation are amended in any way affecting the statements contained in the certificates for outstanding shares,
	or it becomes desirable for any reason, in the discretion of the Board of Directors, to cancel any outstanding certificate for
	shares and issue a new certificate therefor conforming to the rights of the holder, the Board of Directors may order any holders
	of outstanding certificates for shares to surrender and exchange them for new certificates within a reasonable time to be fixed
	by the Board of Directors. Such order may provide that no holder of any such certificate so ordered to be surrendered shall be
	entitled to vote or to receive dividends or exercise any of the other rights of stockholders of record until he shall have complied
	with such order, but such order shall only operate to suspend such rights after notice and until compliance. The duty of surrender
	of any outstanding certificates may also be enforced by action at law.




	 




	2.5       

	Consideration
	for Shares: Types; Adequacy; Effect of Receipt; Actions of Corporation Pending Receipt in Future

	.




	 




	(A)       The
	Board of Directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit
	to the corporation, including but not limited to, cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed,
	or other securities of the corporation.




	 




	(B)       Before
	the corporation issues shares, the Board of Directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for the
	shares to be issued is adequate. The judgment of the Board of Directors as to the adequacy of the consideration received for the
	shares issued is conclusive in the absence of actual fraud in the transaction.




	 




	(C)       When
	the corporation receives the consideration for which the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued
	therefore are fully paid.




	 




	(D)       The
	corporation may place in escrow shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or a promissory note, or make any
	other arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares. The corporation may credit distributions made for the shares against
	their purchase price, until the services are performed, the benefits are received or the promissory note is paid. If the services
	are not performed, the benefits are not received or the promissory note is not paid, the shares escrowed or restricted and the
	distributions credited may be canceled in whole or in part.




	 




	2.6

	Subscription Agreement

	. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, no stockholder of the corporation is individually
	liable for the debts or liabilities of the corporation. A purchaser of shares of stock from the corporation is not liable to the
	corporation or its creditors with respect to the shares, except to pay the consideration for which the shares were authorized
	to be issued or which was specified in the written subscription agreement.




	 




	2.7       

	Lost,
	Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates

	. Any stockholder claiming that his certificate for shares is lost, stolen, or destroyed
	may make an affidavit or affirmation of the fact and lodge the same with the Secretary of the corporation, accompanied by a signed
	application for a new certificate. Thereupon, and upon the giving of a satisfactory bond of indemnity to the corporation, a new
	certificate may be issued of the same tenor and representing the same number of shares as were represented by the certificate
	alleged to be lost, stolen or destroyed. The necessity for such bond and the amount required to be determined by the President
	and Treasurer of the corporation, unless the corporation shall have a transfer agent, in which case the transfer agent shall determine
	the necessity for such bond and the amount required.




	 




	2.8       

	Transfer
	of Shares

	. Subject to the terms of any stockholder agreement relating to the transfer of shares or other transfer restrictions
	contained in the Articles of Incorporation or authorized therein, shares of the corporation shall be transferable on the books
	of the corporation by the holder thereof in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon the surrender and cancellation of
	a certificate or certificates for a like number of shares. Upon presentation and surrender of a certificate for shares properly
	endorsed and payment of all taxes therefor, the transferee shall be entitled to a new certificate or certificates in lieu thereof.
	As against the corporation, a transfer of shares can be made only on the books of the corporation and in the manner hereinabove
	provided, and the corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share as the owner thereof and shall not
	be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share on the part of any other person, whether or not
	it shall have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the statutes of the State of Nevada.




	 




	2.9       

	Restrictions
	on Transfer of Shares

	.




	 




	The
	Corporation will be governed by each of the following restrictions:




	 




	(A)
	     No shares may be transferred except with the prior approval of the directors, who may
	in their absolute discretion refuse to register the transfer of any shares, such approval to be evidenced by a resolution of the
	directors.



	 








	Bylaws of Forge Innovation Development Corp.


	Page

	(B)
	      There shall not be any invitation to the public to subscribe for any shares or debt
	obligations of the corporation




	 




	(C)
	      The number of shareholders of the Corporation exclusive of:




	 




	(i)
	      persons who are in the employment of the Corporation or of an affiliate of the Corporation



	 



	(ii)
	    persons who, having formerly been in the employment of the Corporation or an affiliate of the Corporation, were, while in that
	employment, shareholders of the Corporation and have continued to be shareholders of the Corporation after termination of that
	employment, is limited to not more than 50 persons, two or more persons who are joint registered owners of one or more shares
	being counted as one shareholder.




	 




	2.10       

	Transfer
	Agent

	. Unless otherwise specified by the Board of Directors by resolution, the Secretary of the corporation shall act as transfer
	agent of the certificates representing the shares of stock of the corporation. He shall maintain a stock transfer book, the stubs
	of which shall set forth among other things, the names and addresses of the holders of all issued shares of the corporation, the
	number of shares held by each, the certificate numbers representing such shares, the date of issue of the certificates representing
	such shares, and whether or not such shares originate from original issue or from transfer. Subject to Section 3.7, the names
	and addresses of the stockholders as they appear on the stubs of the stock transfer book shall be conclusive evidence as to who
	are the stockholders of record and as such entitled to receive notice of the meetings of stockholders; to vote at such meetings;
	to examine the list of the stockholders entitled to vote at meetings; to receive dividends; and to own, enjoy and exercise any
	other property or rights deriving from such shares against the corporation. Each stockholder shall be responsible for notifying
	the Secretary in writing of any change in his name or address and failure so to do will relieve the corporation, its directors,
	officers and agents, from liability for failure to direct notices or other documents, or pay over or transfer dividends or other
	property or rights, to a name or address other than the name and address appearing on the stub of the stock transfer book.




	 




	2.11       

	Close
	of Transfer Book and Record Date

	. For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting
	of stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make
	a determination of stockholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may prescribe a period not exceeding sixty
	(60) days prior to any meeting of the stockholders during which no transfer of stock on the books of the corporation may be made,
	or may fix a day not more than sixty (60) days prior to the holding of any such meeting as the day as of which stockholders entitled
	to notice of and to vote at such meetings shall be determined; and only stockholders of record on such day shall be entitled to
	notice or to vote at such meeting. When a determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders has been
	made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

	for any annual meeting of the stockholders, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a special meeting of

	3.5       

	Actions
	at Meetings Not Regularly Called: Ratification and Approval

	. Whenever all stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting consent,
	either by (i) a writing on the records of the meeting or filed with the Secretary; or (ii) presence at such meeting and oral consent
	entered on the minutes; or (iii) taking part in the deliberations at such meeting without objection; the doings of such meeting
	shall be as valid as if had at a meeting regularly called and noticed. At such meeting any business may be transacted which is
	not accepted from the written consent or to the consideration of which no objection for want of notice is made at the time.




	 




	If
	a meeting be irregular for want of notice or of such consent, provided a quorum was present at such meeting, the proceedings of
	the meeting may be ratified and approved and rendered likewise valid and the irregularity or defect therein waived by a writing
	signed by all stockholders having the right to vote at such meeting.




	 




	Such
	consent or approval of stockholders may be made by proxy or attorney, but all such proxies and powers of attorney must be in writing.




	 




	3.6       

	Notice
	of Stockholders’ Meeting: Signature; Contents; Service

	.




	 




	(A)       The
	notice of stockholders’ meetings shall be in writing and signed by the President or a Vice President, or the Secretary, or the
	Assistant Secretary, or by such other person or persons as designated by the Board of Directors. Such notice shall state the purpose
	or purposes for which the meeting is called and the time when, and the place, which may be within or without the State of Nevada,
	where it is to be held.




	 




	A
	copy of such notice shall be either delivered personally to, or shall be mailed postage prepaid to, or shall be sent by telecopy
	to, each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before such
	meeting. If mailed, it shall be directed to a stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation, and
	upon such mailing of any such notice the service thereof shall be complete, and the time of the notice shall begin to run from
	the date upon which such notice is deposited in the mail for transmission to such stockholder. Personal delivery of any such notice
	to any officer of a corporation or association, or to any member of a partnership, shall constitute delivery of such notice to
	such corporation, association, or partnership. If sent by telecopy, it shall be evidenced by proof of transmission to the intended
	recipient.




	 




	Notice
	duly delivered or mailed to a stockholder in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be deemed sufficient, and in
	the event of the transfer of his stock after such delivery or mailing and prior to the holding of the meeting, it shall not be
	necessary to deliver or mail notice of the meeting upon the transferee.




	 




	(B)       Unless
	otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, whenever notice is required to be given, under any provision
	of Nevada law or the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any stockholder to whom:

	and at least two, payments sent by first-class mail of dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been
	mailed addressed to him at his address as shown on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving
	of further notices to him is not required. Any action or meeting taken or held without notice to such a stockholder has the same
	effect as if the notice had been given. If any such stockholder delivers to the corporation a written notice setting forth his
	current address, the requirement that notice be given to him is reinstated.




	 




	3.7       

	Waiver
	of Notice

	. Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given to stockholders, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the

	ten (10) days before such meeting of stockholders, a complete record of the stockholders entitled to vote at each meeting of stockholders
	or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each. The record,
	for a period of ten (10) days prior to such meeting, shall be kept on file at the principal office of the corporation, whether
	within or without the State of Nevada, and shall be subject to inspection by any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting
	at any time during usual business hours. Such record shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and
	shall be subject to the inspection of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting for the purposes thereof.

	The
	original stock transfer books shall be the prima facie evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the record
	or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of stockholders.




	 




	3.9       

	Quorum

	.
	A majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute
	a quorum at any meeting of stockholders, except as otherwise provided by the Nevada Business Corporation Act and the Articles
	of Incorporation. In the absence of a quorum at any such meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting
	from time to time for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum
	shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
	noticed. The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding
	the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.




	 




	3.10     

	Organization

	.
	The Board of Directors shall elect a chairman from among the directors to preside at each meeting of the stockholders. The Board
	of Directors shall elect a secretary to record the discussions and resolutions of each meeting.




	 




	3.11     

	Manner
	of Acting

	. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled
	to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater proportion or number or voting
	by classes is otherwise required by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws.




	 




	3.12     

	Stockholders’
	Proxies

	.




	 




	(A)       At
	any meeting of the stockholders of the corporation any stockholder may designate another person or persons to act as a proxy or
	proxies. If any stockholder designates two or more persons to act as proxies, a majority of those persons present at the meeting,
	or, if only one is present, then that one has and may exercise all of the powers conferred by the stockholder upon all of the
	persons so designated unless the stockholder provides otherwise.




	 




	(B)       Without
	limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him as proxy pursuant to subsection
	(A), the following constitute valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:




	 




	(i)       A
	stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for him as proxy. Execution may be accomplished
	by the signing of the writing by the stockholder or his authorized officer, director, employee, or agent or by causing the signature
	of the stockholder to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, a facsimile signature.




	 




	(ii)      A
	stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of
	a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a firm
	that solicits proxies or like agent who is authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive the transmission.
	Any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information
	from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.
	If it is determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other electronic transmission is valid, the persons appointed by the corporation
	to count the votes of stockholders and determine the validity of proxies and ballots or other persons making those determinations
	must specify the information upon which they relied.




	 




	(C)       Any
	copy, communication by telecopier, or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to subsection
	(B), may be substituted for the original writing or transmission for any purpose for which the original writing or transmission
	could be used, if the copy, communication by telecopier, or other reproduction is a complete reproduction of the entire original
	writing or transmission.




	 




	(D)       No
	such proxy is valid after the expiration of six (6) months from the date of its creation, unless it is coupled with an interest,
	or unless the stockholder specifies in it the length of time for which it is to continue in force, which may not exceed seven
	(7) years from the date of its creation. Subject to these restrictions, any proxy properly created is not revoked and continues
	in full force and effect until another instrument or transmission revoking it or a properly created proxy bearing a later date
	is filed with or transmitted to the secretary of the corporation or another person or persons appointed by the corporation to
	count the votes of stockholders and determine the validity of proxies and ballots.

	that:




	 




	(A)


	If any greater proportion of voting power is required for such action at a meeting, then the greater proportion of written consents is required; and

	6.2       

	Restrictions
	on Transactions Involving Interested Directors or Officers; Compensation of Directors

	.




	 




	(A)       No
	contract or other transaction between the corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the corporation
	and any corporation, firm, or association in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers or are financially
	interested, is void or voidable solely for this reason or solely because any such director or officer is present at the meeting
	of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof that authorizes or approves the contract or transaction, or because the vote
	or votes of common or interested directors are counted for that purpose, if the circumstances specified in any of the following
	paragraphs exist:




	 




	(i)      The
	fact of the common directorship, office or financial interest is disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or committee and
	noted in the minutes, and the board or committee authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract or transaction in good faith by
	a vote sufficient for the purpose without counting the vote or votes of the common or interested director or directors.




	 




	(ii)     The
	fact of the common directorship, office or financial interest is disclosed or known to the stockholders, and they approve or ratify
	the contract or transaction in good faith by a majority vote of stockholders holding a majority of the voting power. The votes
	of the common or interested directors or officers must be counted in any such vote of stockholders.

	fact of the common directorship, office or financial interest is not disclosed or known to the director or officer at the time
	the transaction is brought before the Board of Directors of the corporation for action.

	6.3       

	Indemnification
	of Officers, Directors, Employees and Agents; Advancement of Expenses

	.




	 




	(A)       The
	corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or
	completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, except an action by or in the
	right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation,
	or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
	joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in
	settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding if he acted in good faith
	and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect
	to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action,
	suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, does not,
	of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in
	or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and that, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he had reasonable
	cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.




	 




	(B)       The
	corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or
	completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he
	is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as
	a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against
	expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys’ fees actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with
	the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in
	or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. Indemnification may not be made for any claim, issue, or matter as to
	which such a person has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to be liable
	to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which
	the action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances
	of the case, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.




	 




	(C)       To
	the extent that a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense
	of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in subsections (A) and (B), or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein,
	he must be indemnified by the corporation against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him
	in connection with the defense.

	11















	 




	(D)       Any
	indemnification under subsections (A) and (B), unless ordered by a court or advanced pursuant to subsection (E), must be made
	by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer,
	employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances. The determination must be made:




	 




	(i)       By
	the stockholders;




	 




	(ii)      By
	the Board of Directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit or proceeding;




	 




	(iii)     If
	a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit or proceeding so orders, by independent
	legal counsel in a written opinion; or




	 




	(iv)    If
	a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the act, suit or proceeding cannot be obtained by independent legal counsel
	in a written opinion.




	 




	(E)       The
	Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or an agreement made by the corporation may provide that the expenses of officers and
	directors incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding must be paid by the corporation as they are incurred
	and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
	the director or officer to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he is not
	entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. The provisions of this subsection do not affect any rights to advancement of expenses
	to which corporate personnel other than directors or officers may be entitled under any contract or otherwise by law.




	 




	(F)       The
	indemnification and advancement of expenses authorized in or ordered by a court pursuant to this section:




	 




	(i)

	       

	Does
	not exclude any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Articles
	of Incorporation or any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, for either an action
	in his official capacity or an action in another capacity while holding his office, except that indemnification, unless ordered
	by a court pursuant to subsection (B) or for the advancement of expenses made pursuant to subsection (E), may not be made to or
	on behalf of any director or officer if a final adjudication establishes that his acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct,
	fraud, or a knowing violation of the law and was material to the cause of action.




	 




	(ii)      Continues
	for a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and
	administrators of such a person.
