Ecochlor | Ballast Water Treatment System























































12 Years at Sea
The Ecochlor® Ballast Water Treatment System: proven effective and reliable for over 12 years at sea. The rugged, scalable, modular system offers installation and operational advantages.
Get a quick overview of the system here →

 







                    Rugged, Modular System                  
Highly efficient system offers space, energy, and operational advantages over other ballast water treatment systems.








                    Proven ClO2 Technology                  
Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) has been used in water treatment and industrial applications for 70 years, and on ships for 12 years.








                    Install Case Studies                  
Take a look at our installation and feasibility case studies. The Ecochlor system is ideal for larger bulkers and tankers.








                    How It Works                  
Animated video shows how the system works to produce a biocide, as needed, to disinfect ballast water and meet or exceed existing regulations.

About Us | Ecochlor


























































About Us





About Us
Ecochlor, Inc. has developed proprietary ballast water treatment systems that have been specifically designed to safely and economically eliminate the worldwide transfer of aquatic invasive species.

Ecochlor, Inc. was founded in 2001 with the sole purpose of commercializing recently obtained patents for a superior ballast water treatment technology. The patents encompass US and International protection for the use, generation and control of an active substance (chlorine dioxide) for control of aquatic invasive species in ballast water. The company installed its first commercial scale system in 2004.
The Ecochlor® Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS) provides shipowners with cost effective, environmentally acceptable treatment that complies with all enacted and proposed standards and regulations. In-house experts and the company’s team of strategic partners supply not only complete design and fabrication of the Ecochlor Systems, but also provide marine engineering, naval architecture, chemical treatment expertise, shipboard installation and ongoing technical and regulatory certification support.
Ecochlor’s treatment methodology utilizes the unique properties of chlorine dioxide. This biocide, not to be confused with chlorine, has been used safely and effectively in industrial and municipal water treatment applications for over 70 years but has never been used in any shipboard applications until now.



On July 29, 2004, the company installed its first system on Atlantic Container Line’s Atlantic Compass, one of the world’s largest combined container/RORO ships, a Swedish flagged vessel that carries cargo between Europe and North America. In July 2006, the company installed its second system on the bulker Moku Pahu, operated by Matson Navigation, which carries sugar from Hawaii to the US West Coast and grain to Asia. Both ships were accepted in the US Coast Guard’s Shipboard Technology Evaluation Program (STEP) in 2008. See additional installment case studies in our installs section.
In 2008, Ecochlor began the process of pursuing International Maritime Organization (IMO) Type Approval. Land-based testing took place at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) in the spring and summer of 2008. Shipboard testing took place on the Moku Pahu between July 2010 and February 2011. In 2011, Ecochlor received IMO Type Approval from the German Administration, German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH).
In 2013, Ecochlor received US Coast Guard Alternative Management System (AMS) acceptance for its full line of ballast water treatment systems. This allows ship operators to use an Ecochlor® BWTS in US waters to effectively manage their ballast discharge.
On March 31, 2017, Ecochlor filed an application with the USCG for Type Approval for their Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS). Upon USCG approval, the Ecochlor® BWTS will extend the range of options for shipowners beyond UV and electrochlorination technologies.
The company, with headquarters near Boston in Maynard, Massachusetts and manufacturing in both North Haven, Connecticut and Shanghai, China has the capability to install, service and support its systems throughout the world.

ECOCHLOR INC


The Ecochlor BWTS uses a two-step process - filtration followed by disinfection with chlorine dioxide. The system's effectiveness is not impaired by variations in salinity, temperature, turbidity, organics, and vibration. Furthermore, the small size, low power and low maintenance make it ideally suited for installation on the world's largest ships. The Ecochlor BWTS has completed all testing for USCG Type Approval.
