DIMENSIONS (In Inches) 24 x 20 x 45




 Packing Tape
Before you select your boxes, note that you will need packing tape to put them together. Packing tape is available in different size rolls – we recommend the larger of the two rolls because the difference in price is very little and you will likely use all the tape.
One 60-yard roll will tape:

12 - 14 small boxes
10 - 12 medium boxes
8 - 10 large or extra large boxes






Tip: Tape like a pro
Review the following recommended taping method to help ensure secure seams while helping to prevent crushing:


1. Fold in the shorter flaps first
2. Fold in long flaps and secure with three strips of tape down the center
3. Place two final strips perpendicular about three inches from the box edge






 Tip: Dishes and Fragile Items
Be sure to wrap your dishes and fragile items carefully to protect them during moving and storage. We have everything you need including:

Bubble Pack – Superior protection for fragile items
Dish Packs and Glass Packs
Newsprint wrapping paper
Labels for marking boxes







 Tip: Choosing the Right Boxes
When packing boxes for storage, do not use boxes from supermarkets, liquor stores or other food and beverage retail outlets. Food odors remain in the cardboard and can attract pests and rodents into the storage space. We want to do everything we can to protect your belongings and those of your storage neighbors.
As boxes age, they become weaker in the walls.  Be sure that your boxes are strong and can stand up to the pressure of stacking one on top of another.  During your move and during storage, boxes that collapse can make a terrible mess!





Moving Boxes and Packing Supplies Guide 
Packing up your home means you need more than just a few boxes; you'll need tape, bubble pack, and newsprint, as well. To ensure you have all the packing supplies you need, consider purchasing moving supplies from Life Storage, using the charts below as reference.

Life Storage, Inc. Unveils ‘She Shed’ Product Line



Share Article


















Female-focused ‘escape’ now available in select markets starting at $99 a month.







Life Storage unveils the all new 'She Shed' product line

Women have expressed a need in their lives for the female equivalent – a quiet reprieve from the world.


Buffalo, N.Y. (PRWEB)
March 31, 2017
 Life Storage, Inc. announced today the launch of a new line of products targeted specifically to their female customers. The state-of-the-art ‘She Shed’ offers women a discreet and luxurious escape from the perils of motherhood.
The national self storage company will be testing the new ‘She Shed’ product line in select markets this summer. These specialized 10 by 20 foot units come equipped with decorative lighting, a comfy couch, a plush carpet, a flat screen television, and engineered hardwood floors. Protected with an impenetrable security system, the unit is designed to be untraceable – keeping unwanted distractions out while providing a calm, serene atmosphere within.
‘The idea to turn conventional storage units into ‘She Sheds’ came as a direct response to a surge in demand from our female customers who have grown tired of watching men retreat to their ‘man caves,’” said Molliann Spear, director of concept design for Life Storage. “Women have expressed a need in their lives for the female equivalent – a quiet reprieve from the world. At Life Storage – we recognize that it’s not just storage, it’s life.”
While the basic ‘She Shed’ unit starts at $99 a month, various upgrades including high-speed internet access, an in-unit P.O. Box, a monthly subscription to NetFlix, and regular standing masseuse visits, among other options, are available for an added fee. 
“We are committed to personalizing our ‘She Sheds’ to meet our customer’s unique desires,” said Spear. “Whether it’s an in-unit Jacuzzi or a portable sauna, we are open to any and all customizations to ensure the sanctity of the space for our customer.”
Women are encouraged to share their personal ‘wish list’ with Life Storage’s Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts using #ThatsWhatSheShed. Suggestions will be considered for future product enhancements.  
Starting in summer 2017, ‘She Sheds’ will be available in most major cities, including: Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Atlanta, and the surrounding New York City region. Factors including population density, the average number of people per household and median home square footage were taken into account when selecting initial markets to offer the ‘She Shed.’
For additional information or to reserve your ‘She Shed’ online, please visit https://www.lifestorage.com/SheShed/. 
About Life Storage, Inc.
Life Storage, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed equity REIT that is in the business of acquiring and managing self storage facilities.  The Company operates more than 650 self storage facilities in 29 states under the names Life Storage and Uncle Bob’s Self Storage.  For more information, visit https://www.lifestorage.com/.

 Home  Company
Life Storage, Inc.


Life Storage, Inc. is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires and manages self-storage properties throughout the United States. Headquartered in Buffalo, New York, the company employs over 1,600 people and operates approximately 650 self-storage facilities encompassing over 45 million square feet in 29 states.
Life Storage, Inc. currently operates under the brand names Life Storage® and Uncle Bob’s Self Storage®, and is one of the largest self-storage companies in the world.
Founded in 1982, the company was originally a financial planning firm but opened its first self-storage facility in Florida in 1985. Within three years, it owned approximately 30 facilities along the East Coast and accumulated 62 facilities over the next decade. Life Storage was originally known as Sovran Self Storage, Inc., operating under the brand name Uncle Bob’s Self Storage beginning in the late 1980s. 
Life Storage went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1995, trading under the name Sovran Self Storage. Within a year, it grew its holding to 111 self-storage facilities along the East Coast and Texas. Life Storage doubled to 222 facilities by 1999 and by 2003 operated in 21 states. 
Life Storage continued its acquisitions throughout the United States, expanding into cities such as Chicago, New York, Atlanta, and St. Louis. It operated 478 facilities by the end of 2013 and 500 facilities by the end of 2014. It made its way to the West Coast in 2016, acquiring California-based LifeStorage LP. 
The company rebranded from Sovran Self Storage, Inc. to Life Storage in 2016 and now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LSI (formerly NYSE:SSS).
Throughout 2017, all Uncle Bob’s locations will be rebranded to Life Storage – a name that more closely depicts the Company’s customer-centric focus, progressive growth, and innovative technologies.

LSI: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 05/31/2017 settlement date, and Life Storage Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 9.87 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.01. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 04/01/2010
            

                BBB has determined that Life Storage, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

 Home  Storage Facilities  Moving Boxes & Supplies

Moving Boxes & Supplies 
You'll need a few of these! Life Storage has a complete line of tough, mover-grade moving boxes and packing supplies at our self storage facilities.







 Small Moving Box 

For packing books, CDs, DVDs, photos and other small items. 
For fragile keepsakes – be sure to wrap properly and handle with extreme care. 
Be careful not to over-pack the box, making it too heavy to lift.


DIMENSIONS (In Inches) 16 x 12.5 x 12.5
– Easy to lift with side handles
– One 60-yard roll of tape will accommodate about 12 - 14 small boxes





 Medium Moving Box 

Our most versatile moving box for a variety of items
For kitchen and household belongings, office items, framed photos and more
Be careful not to over-pack the box, making it too heavy to lift.


DIMENSIONS (In Inches) 18 x 18 x 16
– Easy to lift with side handles
– One 60-yard roll of tape will accommodate about 10 - 12 medium boxes





 Large Moving Box

Wrap smaller, heavier items in towels or linens in these large boxes.
Especially important – be careful not to over-pack the box, making it too heavy to lift.

 Wardrobe Box

DIMENSIONS (In Inches) 24 x 20 x 45




 Packing Tape
Before you select your boxes, note that you will need packing tape to put them together. Packing tape is available in different size rolls – we recommend the larger of the two rolls because the difference in price is very little and you will likely use all the tape.
One 60-yard roll will tape:

12 - 14 small boxes
10 - 12 medium boxes
8 - 10 large or extra large boxes






Tip: Tape like a pro
Review the following recommended taping method to help ensure secure seams while helping to prevent crushing:


1. Fold in the shorter flaps first
2. Fold in long flaps and secure with three strips of tape down the center
3. Place two final strips perpendicular about three inches from the box edge






 Tip: Dishes and Fragile Items
Be sure to wrap your dishes and fragile items carefully to protect them during moving and storage. We have everything you need including:

Bubble Pack – Superior protection for fragile items
Dish Packs and Glass Packs
Newsprint wrapping paper
Labels for marking boxes







 Tip: Choosing the Right Boxes
When packing boxes for storage, do not use boxes from supermarkets, liquor stores or other food and beverage retail outlets. Food odors remain in the cardboard and can attract pests and rodents into the storage space. We want to do everything we can to protect your belongings and those of your storage neighbors.
As boxes age, they become weaker in the walls.  Be sure that your boxes are strong and can stand up to the pressure of stacking one on top of another.  During your move and during storage, boxes that collapse can make a terrible mess!
