Setting of Lights


Our Setting of Lights service is a powerful but cost-effective way to get what you desire. We set glass-encased candles (sometimes called 7 day candles) dressed with Dr. E.'s hoodoo condition oils and real herbs/minerals, prayed over by our rootworkers for maximum effect. We also take the time to attach your photos and petitions to our candles, in order to directly affect your intended target. Once your candle is done burning we'll prepare a candle burn report with signs and interpretations from your candle's burn and deliver it to you through email.
