Should you file a  DBA as a  sole owner, form an LLC, or Incorporate? In general, if you are one person,  and have a lot of personal assets, incorporate or form an LLC.  You will be protected from law suits/creditors and you may  save on business taxes.   An LLC is far superior to incorporation because it protects both your business and personal assets.

  the government will tax you.  For example, an LLC has a more favorable tax treatment compared to a sole owner.
Regardless of legal structure, all businesses need a Business License and an EIN but also need to select a legal stucture choosing from Sole Propritor, 
 Partnership, LLC, or Corproration.

 Thus, file a DBA if you don't file an LLC.  You are required to file a DBA if you are a partneship or a sole owner and you don't form an LLC. If you form an LLC, you need an LLC Certificate if you select the LLC structure etc.
 
A DBA, LLC or Corporation Certificate is Issued by The State.   A DBA  Doing Business As is the registration
of your businesss name. (A DBA is also called a Fictitious /Assumed Business Name or Trade Name. IMPORTANT: YOU DON'T NEED TO FILE A DBA IF YOU FORM AN LLC!

So, all businesses need to select a legal structure, in this case an LLC, and obtain a
Business License 
and   A Federal LLC(EIN) 
(While all businesses must obtain a business license, the EIN is for  Employers, Independent Contractors, LLCs, Partnerships, and Corporations that 
 are required to obtain a federal EIN.  If you are a sole owner independent contractor or an employer, you will need an EIN or you can nevertheless obtain it

IRS rule: The client must issue a 1099 form to the independent contractor and the independent contractor must have a federal LLC.

  Businesses that use the full legal name of the owner as a business name do not need to register an assumed business name.  So, for example, your name is "John X Doe" and you use that as a business name. 
    
Incorporation

✔ Incorporation

If you do form an Early Childhood Education  llc or incorporate  (about $49 plus state fees for most states)  your Early Childhood Education business instead of just filing a fictitious business name (dba), 
it will help you avoid legal and financial personal liability arising out of business transactions and you will not have to register the Visalia business name.
Instead of filing a  Tulare County fictitious business name (our service fee includes dba business name filing and legal paper publication) you can elect to incorporate in  
 CA  or form an CA LLC (starts @ $49 plus state fee  for most states & includes bylaws and LLC operating agreement)..

          LLC (Limited Liability Company) FAQs: 
Q: Should I consider forming an LLC?   
A: Perhaps filing an llc may be a good idea though some start with an S corp. On the other hand, if you want to issue shares, you may want a C corporation.   If your business name is.  
deas XYZtch , Inc.Co.    
requires a fictitious business name registration, which also requires a fee to be registered.  
Registering a fictitious business name does not protect that name nor does it protect the business owner from personal liability related to business actions as setting up a limited liability company (LLC) does.   
Our recommendation that since you need to pay a fee to register the business name, simply form a limited liability company (LLC) for a similar fee and get both corporate status and protection for the name as well as personal liabilities.   
So, for instance, if someone slips and falls in your business premises, they can sue you personally if you are not a limited liability company (LLC).  
Also, consider the prestige that a limited liability company (LLC) affords.  Is a name like John's Transmissiona shop  better than   AEMCOO TRANS, LLC? 

Q: Where should I Incorporate or set up an LLC. I.e., what state?
A: We always recommend that you file an llc in the state you conduct business. So, you can form an LLC (Limited Liabiliity Company). 
Q: How should I name my business LLC? 
A: You can brainstorm or try a google search. Find an interesting name.  If you cannot find in on google, then more than 90% it is available.
Q:  Do I need a lot of capital to form an LLC? 
A:  No, you don't need capital to start an LLC. 
Q: Do I need a lawyer to set up an LLC? If I set up an LLC, will the LLC help me protect my business LLC from creditors?
A: We can set up your llc here. You don' t need a laywer.  And yes, actually, only an LLC can help you protect the LLC from its creditors especially if you have another partner member owner in that LLC.
Q: Do I need to obtain a federal  or state LLC number before forming a limited liability company (LLC)  or getting other licenses?
A: 
Q: How do I build credit under my LLC business? 
A: Start by applying for a line of credit for your LLC from your bank if you already have some personal credit.

What capital you need to start your business?  In my opinion, very little even though some may tell you that you that in  VISALIA business with just $8855 or $836013 that depends on your budget. Starting your business in  
  VISALIA TULARE VISALIA, 93277 calls for some numbers: it has about 44737
residents, though  only about 17319 families in this zip code area but still enough to support your business of the state of California. 
 In addition,  consider that a(n) 559 telephone area code my be desirable to increase reachability and 
and identifiability. Nevertheless, you will need a place to set up and operate your business from

note that you can use the house as a home based business as well. Your physical address in  VISALIA will be 
your business address. For Instance, your business address could be 8331  VISALIA Hwy/Blvd  or 88TH Street/Ave or 
VISALIA,  California 93277. You can use a 93277  P.O. Box address as your as 
your business mailing address. E.g. P.O Box 
74126
 VISALIA,California 93277 .

 starting any type of business. Briefly, there are about 36013,  anglo saxons, 
11378 latinos, and 855 Americans of African Origin in the  93277 zipcode area. Another consideration

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
