Clement David “Clem” Izzi, 76, resident of Nashua died peacefully Friday, February 10, 2017 at Southern New Hampshire Medical Center. He was the beloved husband of his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth (Kelemen) Izzi, who was at his side at his passing.

He was born in New Brunswick, NJ on August 7, 1940, and was a son of the late Peter A. and Antoinette (Iovino) Izzi. He graduated from St. Peter’s High School in New Brunswick in 1958 and earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Organic Chemistry from Rutgers University in 1962.

Clement retired from a long career as a business manager in 1998 to spend more time with his family. He began his career as a Chemist at Johns-Manville Corporation, Manville, NJ and worked his way up to Product Manager before the division was acquired by Nashua Corporation in 1970. He moved his family to Nashua, NH in 1972 and became the General Sales Manager and later Marketing Manager for the Industrial Tape Division at Nashua Corporation. In 1975 he returned to NJ for 2 ½ years to work as General Sales Manager for  GENtech Industries, Inc. Clem became President and General Manager of Ideal Tape Company in Lowell, MA in 1978. During this time he also spent several years as Chairman of the Greater Lowell Private Industry Council. After 11 plus years at Ideal Tape Co., he became President of Comet Products Inc., a supplier of food service items, located in Chelmsford, MA. When Comet Products was acquired by The Waddington Group, he became President of Waddingtons North America (WNA). Before retiring he spent several years advising companies across the country as a business consultant.

Clem was a lover of literature and all genres of music. He traveled the world and he enjoyed golf, swimming in the Pacific Ocean off of the Big Island of Hawaii, snow skiing, and team sports. He played football on the undefeated St. Peter’s High School team of 1956 and enjoyed that game until he suffered a career ending knee injury. He was a faithful Red Sox baseball fan, and he especially enjoyed attending high school and college basketball games around the Northeast with his friends. He and his wife are the honorees on the Boston College Head Basketball Coach endowment named in 2015.

Clem never lost his sense of humor even in the face of enormous physical challenges in his later years. He exemplified strength and courage and could light up a room with his presence. He was just as great a listener as a story teller. His wisdom guided and influenced everyone with whom he came in contact. He employed and mentored many First Church youth to help him when he lost his ability to walk and to see. He sat on the New Hampshire National Spinal Cord Injury Association Advisory Committee for 4 years and was active directing its board members. He also sat on the NH Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Advisory Council for 3 years. His attitude was to never, ever give up and to not feel sorry for yourself. He motivated many with this life lesson. He was a selfless, generous soul who was the first to help a friend or family member in need.

Clement was an exceptional man loved by many but especially by his family. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his two daughters, Karen Ann Bristing and her husband Steven of La Canada Flintridge, CA, and Susan Marie Gentile and her husband Sabatino of Marlton, NJ; four grandchildren, Andrew Gross, Matthew Bristing, Jonathan and Heather Gentile; a brother Stephen J. Izzi  and his wife Kim of Florida; and many nieces, nephews, colleagues and close friends.

Relatives and friends are invited to attend his funeral mass at the Immaculate Conception Church at 216 East Dunstable Road, Nashua on Saturday February 18th at 10am. Burial will take place at the convenience of the family. To view an on-line memorial, send a condolence or for more information, go to www.anctil-rochette.com.  Services and arrangements have been entrusted to the care of the Anctil-Rochette & Son Funeral Home. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, you consider a donation to charities most important to Clement: the NHNSCIA program of Granite State Independent Living, 21 Chenell Drive, Concord, NH 03301 https://www.gsil.org/how-to-help/donate-now/ or to the Salvation Army of Lowell, 150 Appleton Street, Lowell, MA  01853 http://massachusetts.salvationarmy.org/MA/Lowell
