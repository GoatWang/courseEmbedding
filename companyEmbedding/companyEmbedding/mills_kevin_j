This mill is amazing for the value. Don’t let the low price think this machine is low in quality, its not. From the Kohler engine that starts first pull every time and runs strong through all types of wood. The construction of the mill is top notch and backed by the company for any defects. We ran thousands of board feet and this mill is a beast.
