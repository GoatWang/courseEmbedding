Estate Management Counselors, LLC
Estate Management Counselors, LLC was established in response to individuals’ requests to receive coordinated objective fee-based financial, investment and estate planning advice.  The two facets that are coordinated are Financial Investment Planning and Estate Planning.  Other firms, either investment or law firms, only provide the client with one service therefore exposing the client to unnecessary financial and estate planning risks.  EMC provides both services to our clients at one location so the client works with only one set of professionals.  This unique service will assure the client that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing. 
Clients of EMC are provided with objective financial recommendations and counseling to assist them in reaching their investment and personal objectives.  EMC is not compensated on a commission basis for investment recommendations.  Therefore, the conflict of interest is removed from EMC recommending an investment just to generate a commission.  The advice that is given to all clients will always be unbiased and in the client’s best interest.
Clients choose to work with EMC for several reasons.  We offer our clients professional and courteous service with the highest level of integrity.  Our practice is focused on building long-term relationships with our clients and not a transaction oriented relationship.  We guarantee to our clients a level of service that is unmatched by any other firm.  If you want to receive objective financial, investment and estate planning advice, we look forward to working with you.

How to Unlock the Ultimate Estate Plan
Wills, trusts, and other estate planning documents can be very important in preserving your property and in getting property where we want it to go.  Without a will or trust, upon a person’s death, that person’s assets are disposed of according to state law.  State law, called the law of decent and distribution, may or may not match what the deceased person’s desires were as to whom should get the property or how the property should be handled.  Most of us don’t want the state deciding when our estate is distributed, and to whom.  If you procrastinate and you do nothing, that’s what will happen, as sure as the sun sets in the west.  Request your complimentary copy, “How to Unlock the Ultimate Estate Plan” today.
 Having an ultimate estate plan will….

Keep your kids from squandering their inheritance
Provide peace of mind
Keep you from inadvertently disinheriting your kids
Avoid ancillary probate and keep your financial matters private
