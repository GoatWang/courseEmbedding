The Counter® Custom Built Burgers Appoints Edie Ames as President and Chief Operating Officer

By: The Counter |  12 Shares     228 Reads
August 05, 2015 // Franchising.com // LOS ANGELES, CA  – The Counter® Custom Built Burgers is pleased to welcome Edie Ames as the new President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the Los Angeles-based build-your-own-burger restaurant group. An industry veteran who brings over 25 years of restaurant experience, Ames will oversee both corporate and franchised operations of The Counter® and its fast-casual sister concept, BUILT® Custom Burgers.
Ames joins The Counter® from Wolfgang Puck Catering, where she served as Executive Vice President of Wolfgang Puck Catering and managed over 50 venues with a volume of $150 million.
Ames launched her restaurant operations and training career at Malone’s Grill & Bar, a Georgia-based independent chain restaurant operator. After eight years, Ames joined California Pizza Kitchen, where she would spend the next twelve years climbing the ranks, from General Manager to Regional Director of Operations and eventually Regional Vice President of Operations and Training.
With a passion for - and understanding of - operations, training, and development, Ames went on to become President of Morton’s Restaurant Group, where she led a worldwide staff of more than 4500 employees and had full responsibility for the day-to-day operations of Morton’s’ 76 restaurants, along with TREVI, the company’s upscale Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.
In 2010, Ames joined Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group as Chief Operations Officer of both Del Frisco’s and Sullivan’s concepts, and after successfully restructuring the brands for growth, she proceeded to Real Mex Restaurant with the challenge of revitalizing the collection of brands.
“Edie has a proven track record of driving a restaurant group to success and sustaining its profitability - traits that will benefit our own growth plans,” said Craig Albert, co-CEO of The Counter®. “We’re excited to have her on board.”
“Edie’s grasp of hospitality and development will be instrumental as we continue to evolve and grow,” said Jeff Weinstein, founder and co-CEO of The Counter®. “Her tenacity, leadership experience, and enthusiasm make her a welcomed addition to the team.”
“I’ve been a longtime guest of The Counter® and I’m thrilled to join such a successful and dynamic team,” said Ames. “There’s a passion behind the brand and entrepreneurial energy that excites me.”
About The Counter®
Founded in 2003, The Counter®’s mission was to challenge the traditional burger joint. The Culver City, California-based brand grew into more than 40 stores. The Counter® offers a fresh, unconventional approach to creating the ultimate burger, offering a checklist-style clipboard menu that lists over a million possible burger combinations: seven proteins, 16 cheeses, 45 toppings, 23 unique sauces and eight types of buns. The Counter® offers a full-service, casual dining experience in an inviting space with industrial décor and upbeat music.
There are currently over 40 locations in the United States – including two airport locations. In addition there are four international locations in Ireland, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. For more information, visit thecounterburger.com.
About BUILT®
In 2013, The Counter® launched BUILT® by The Counter®, which serves the same premium, customizable burgers and burgers-in-a-bowl made famous at The Counter® but in a fast casual environment. There are currently four locations - Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco and San Diego - in addition to the new Kuala Lumput location. For additional information on BUILT®, visit builtcustomburgers.com.

  Caroline Gabsewics







by Caroline GabsewicsStaff WriterWhen someone first meets Edie Ames and finds out what she does for a living, they may be a little surprised.Ames is the president of Morton’s The Steakhouse and has been for the past two years. Her name is one thing that can confuse people, only if they don’t know how to say it properly. Her whole life people have mistakenly called her “Eddie,” when it’s pronounced Edie as Falco or Brickell.“I get letters all of the time for ‘Mr. Ames’,” she said. “It makes me laugh. My brothers still call me ‘Eddie’ so I am used to it.”Ames also said she doesn’t let the perception that she is a female in a man’s world get in her way.“I don’t focus on being a female,” said Ames. “It has never stopped me.“My board of directors expect the same thing from me that they would expect from a man.”Ames, 41, doesn’t see herself as someone who always aspired to be a president of a company, but rather someone who has worked hard to get where she is today.“I’m not a climber,” she said. “But, I have been very fortunate that things have happened that way for me.”Ames hasn’t worked her way up the chain within Morton’s, but she has been working in restaurants since she was a teenager.Ames grew up in Chicago, where Morton’s is based, and began working as a waitress at Bakers Square at the age of 15. Her management career began in Atlanta at a restaurant called Malone’s. She then moved to Los Angeles where she was the vice president of operations and training for California Pizza Kitchen. She spent 12 years at California Pizza Kitchen before she got the call from Morton’s.“It is a people industry. It has grown on me and I have never left,” she said. “It is funny though how this (Morton’s) brought me home.”Ames got the job with Morton’s after her predecessor was asked if he knew someone who would be a good fit for the high-end steak house chain.“He asked him if there is anyone he would recommend for the job,” said Ames. “And the gentleman suggested me.“I was very happy I got that call and we decided to meet for dinner. At the end of dinner I knew I would be joining Morton’s.”Ames is happy to be at Morton’s and says there are plenty of reasons she enjoys overseeing all 74 locations.“Our culture and first and foremost our people are incredible,” said Ames. “We have unbelievable tenure. We are celebrating our 30th anniversary next year and we have people who have been here for 10, 20, 25 years.”Ames said every time an employee celebrates an anniversary with the company, they are recognized.“They can bring a guest with them to Chicago, we put them up in the Ritz Carlton and we have dinner at the restaurant,” she said. “It all comes from the family feeling that lives with the organization.”Ames also said their product quality is second to none and they know how to build relationships with their guests.“It all goes right back to the people,” she said.When Ames became president she set a goal for herself to get to know her 4,500 employees and a little about what they and their guests want to see at Morton’s. Part of that goal was to visit all 74 of Morton’s locations including the two in Canada and the one in Singapore in six months. Those six months turned into two years.“It was a priority of mine,” she said. “I needed to get through the tour because it is important to get a feeling from each of the restaurants.“I wanted to understand what their culture is about and they told me what they thought needed to be done in the next couple of years.”The changes made at Morton’s — whether it’s the menu, decor, service or employee benefits — the ideas all come from the employees and guests of Morton’s.“That is how we run our company,” said Ames. “Everything comes from listening to the employees. They are the ones that hear it on a day-to-day basis.”Some changes included new menu items that the guests are asking for and others included different employee benefits.“You hear things from your employees 30 or 40 times and if you don’t take care of it, then you aren’t doing your job,” she said.Now that she has completed her “tour” changes are being made and Ames plans to scale back her traveling.“I am going to continue to do that (visit the different locations),” she said. “Not as often though.”Ames was on a mission to get the feeling from each restaurant. The visits weren’t inspections, but rather an opportunity to experience each Morton’s and what makes them unique depending on their location. During the visits, Ames meets with the hourly employees and then the management team.“I get to know them, pick their brain a little about what they love and don’t love and we talk about guest comments,” she said.Ames was in Jacksonville on Aug. 16 visiting with the employees, just as she did at the other locations. This was her first trip to Jacksonville’s Morton’s as well as her first trip to Jacksonville.“I was thoroughly impressed,” she said. “I loved the restaurant and what is going on around the restaurant, but most importantly I loved the staff.“They are passionate and friendly.”So are there plans for a second location in Jacksonville?“You just never know,” said Ames. “We are always looking for new locations.”Even though Ames was only in town for a day, she said it was good to see the amount of growth in the area. Morton’s is on Prudential drive next door to San Marco Place and across the street from The Strand and The Peninsula.“There was a tremendous amount of growth — a lot of growth around my little corner of the world,” said Ames. “I feel the area will continue to grow.”Ames just celebrated her 41st birthday and likes being back in Chicago where she grew up. Ames’ husband works for Cosi, a restaurant very similar to Panera, and they have two rottweilers as well as nine nieces and nephews that keep them busy.“My husband does the same thing I do so he understands the work load,” she said. “It’s not easy, but he understands. We have a great dog sitter, too.”Ames said she is very content these days.“The fact that I was suggested for the position — I love what I do, my people and my company and I am looking forward to moving into the future,” she said.

When pioneering blacksmith, Captain John Ames, began making America's first metal shovels in 1774, colonists were just beginning their quest for independence. For a country that was literally building from the ground up, quality metal shovels and other tools quickly became essential components in nearly every endeavor that built our nation.
Ames shovels were used in numerous landmark events including the groundbreaking for the B & O Railroad in Baltimore; the building of the transcontinental railroad; the search for California gold in the 1840's; the installation of the Statue of Liberty; Admiral Byrd's exploration of Antarctica; the building of the Hoover Dam; the creation of Mount Rushmore and the construction of the interstate highway system.
The family-owned company grew to become an industrial leader during the 19th century. In the 1870's Read more about Ames

When pioneering blacksmith, Captain John Ames, began making America's first metal shovels in 1774, colonists were just beginning their quest for independence. For a country that was literally building from the ground up, quality metal shovels and other tools quickly became essential components in nearly every endeavor that built our nation.
Ames shovels were used in numerous landmark events including the groundbreaking for the B & O Railroad in Baltimore; the building of the transcontinental railroad; the search for California gold in the 1840's; the installation of the Statue of Liberty; Admiral Byrd's exploration of Antarctica; the building of the Hoover Dam; the creation of Mount Rushmore and the construction of the interstate highway system.
The family-owned company grew to become an industrial leader during the 19th century. In the 1870's Ames produced more than 5,000 shovels each day - 60 percent of the world's production of metal shovels. Around that time, Oakes Ames, one of the owners, invented a handle bending machine to efficiently produce the famous Ames bend, a revolutionary shovel design in its time.
Originally located in Massachusetts, the company began its long tradition of supplying shovels and other tools for war efforts during the Revolutionary War. The company has continued supporting United States war efforts for more than two centuries. During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln personally asked Ames to supply shovels to the Union army. When World War I battles exposed troops to the dangers of rapid machine gunfire, Ames played an integral role in supplying the tools to dig protective trenches. The efforts continued during WWII when Ames produced 11 million entrenching tools, armored tank plating and shell casings for American forces. In 1964, Ames was awarded a contract to produce for the army, a hand entrenching tool consisting of a folding blade, pick and hickory handle. During the next three years, Ames produced 1.6 million of these tools. And, to help in the Vietnam War efforts, Ames was awarded an order to produce 275,000 folding lightweight entrenching tools.
The company remained family owned until the 1950's. Several ownership changes and product line acquisitions brought continued growth to the company. By the late 1980's, Ames sales exceeded $100 million. In 1999, Ames purchased True Temper from the Huffy Corporation and now operates as Ames True Temper headquartered in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania.
