Products & Services
Wet Benches Trio-Tech’s wet bench business segment designs, develops and manufactures cleaning, rinsing and drying wet stations for processing silicon wafers, flat panel displays and other microelectronic substrates.Our manual, semi-automated and fully-automated wet stations are customized to meet customers’ requirements (such as pre-diffusion cleaning, nitride films etching and photo resist stripping etc).

All our equipment comply with SEMI (S2-93) manufacturing safety guidelines and FM-200 standards. The bench materials are also SS, PP and FM-4910 approved.One of the first considerations when contemplating a wet process station is the general station configuration and design. 
Depending on the type of chemicals to be used, it may be necessary to utilize an enclosed Fumehood design instead of an open bench design, especially in order to minimize fumes in the work area. 



 Automated Wet Station 
For higher volume applications, or if repeatable handling is critical, it is worthwhile considering Universal Systems' VLF-2002 Series of automated wet process stations - designed to provide maximum device throughput, operator safety and ease of use. Operator errors are virtually eliminated through the use of SMARTware scheduling software. 
Features: 

 Linear Robot Transfer Systems 
Proprietary design allows for quick & smooth transfer of product from tank to tank 
Max. velocity is 24 in./sec at rated load,vertical axis 
Max acceleration 48 in./sec at rated load, horizontal axis 
50-100 lb load capacity
PC control

 


Semi-Automated Wet Station 
 The US Model US-VLF Semi-Automated Wet Station includes all the features of our manual wet process stations plus several additional features for faster and more reliable processing. 
 The US-VLF family of products is ideal for critical timing of process chemicals, handling of product through hazardous chemical baths or similar applications where operator-assisted processing is recommended. 
 Features: 

 Pneumatic/Servomotor Robotic Systems 
 Natural polypropylene housing with N2 purge 
 Rotation capabilities of 0-180 º C 
 30 lb/50lb load capacity 
PLC / PC Control 


 


Fumehoods 
 One of the first considerations when contemplating a wet process station is the general station configuration and design. Depending on the type of chemicals to be used, it may be necessary to utilize an enclosed Fumehood design instead of an open bench design, especially in order to minimize fumes in the work area. 
 Our Fumehoods are designed for end-of-process cleaning or solvent process operations where fume containment is the primary concern. 
 Many of the same features of our wet process stations are included in the design of Universals Fumehoods. 

  


Process Tanks 
 We offer a variety of standard and custom designed process tanks for almost any application. 
 Our wide range of tanks include:

 Ambient Tank, Overflow Cascade Rinser, Utility Sink, Quick Dump Rinser 
 Low/Medium/ High Temperature, Re-circulating,Filtered Tanks 
 Ultrasonic Tank 
 Megasonic Tank 
 N2/IPA Drying Tank 

          Tank Materials : PP, PVDF, PFA , Quartz, SS 



Transfer Arms 
 Robot transfer arms are extremely helpful for wet process applications that require precise, repeatable operations especially where dangerous chemicals are used in the process baths. In some cases the weight of the process materials requires mechanical assistance, especially when larger diameter substrates or multiple cassettes are processed. 
 Pneumatic Robot Transfer System :

 Natural polypropylene housing with N2 purge. 
 Rotation capabilities of 0-180°C 
 30lb. Load capacity 
 PLC Control 

 Servomotor Robot Transfer System :

 Plastic housing with N2 purge. 
 Rotation capabilities of 0-180°C 
 50lbs. Load capacity 
 PLC or PC control 

 Linear Robot Transfer System :

 Proprietary design allows for quick & smooth transfer of product from tank to tank 
 Max. velocity is 24in./sec at rated load, vertical axis. 
 Max. acceleration 48in./sec at rated load, horizontal axis. 
 50 - 100 lb. load capacity 
 PC Control 


  


Process Controllers 
 We offer several types of controllers for almost any application - from basic tank auto-drain functions to complex, but easy-to-use, PC recipe storage, activation and process monitoring. 
 Technical Bulletin No. CTRLS.01-01 describes the features of our controllers, especially our PC/PLC-based systems, including sample PC screens which illustrate the range of capabilities available using our powerful, but easy-to-use, PC-based controllers. 
 Emergency Power Off - Process Tank Controller 
 Quick Dump Rinse Controller

 0-99 Dump cycles 
 Dump duration 
 Adjustable control cycles & remote start/stop capability 
 Individual touch-tone process controller 
 EEPROM microprocessor 
 Timed or liquid level sensor fill cycles programmable 


  


Chemical Dispensing Systems 
 We offer chemical handling equipment in order to provide a total customer solution. Our product range includes the Series CD-2002 Chemical Blending equipment which provides automatic, precisely controlled chemical transport from a house supply to our process equipment, using our latest PC/PLC based control systems or individual controllers. 
Our Bulk Chemical Dispensing systems are available for our full range of wet process equipment.
