	Notes to Statement of Investments (unaudited)





	1. ORGANIZATION





	Franklin High Income Trust (Trust) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as an open-end investment company, consisting of one fund, the Franklin High Income Fund (Fund).





	2. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT VALUATION





	The Fund's investments in financial instruments are carried at fair value daily. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Under procedures approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the Board), the Funds administrator, investment manager and other affiliates have formed the Valuation and Liquidity Oversight Committee (VLOC). The VLOC provides administration and oversight of the Fund's valuation policies and procedures, which are approved annually by the Board. Among other things, these procedures allow the Fund to utilize independent pricing services, quotations from securities and financial instrument dealers, and other market sources to determine fair value.




	Equity securities listed on an exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of the day, respectively. Foreign equity securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is earlier. The value is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the security is determined. Over-the-counter (OTC) securities are valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative market. Certain equity securities are valued based upon fundamental characteristics or relationships to similar securities. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset value.




	Debt securities generally trade in the OTC market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund's pricing services use multiple valuation techniques to determine fair value. In instances where sufficient market activity exists, the pricing services may utilize a market-based approach through which quotes from market makers are used to determine fair value. In instances where sufficient market activity may not exist or is limited, the pricing services also utilize proprietary valuation models which may consider market characteristics such as benchmark yield curves, credit spreads, estimated default rates, anticipated market interest rate volatility, coupon rates, anticipated timing of principal repayments, underlying collateral, and other unique security features in order to estimate the relevant cash flows, which are then discounted to calculate the fair value. Securities denominated in a foreign currency are converted into their U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the close of the NYSE on the date that the values of the foreign debt securities are determined.




	Certain derivative financial instruments (derivatives) trade in the OTC market. The Funds pricing services use various techniques including industry standard option pricing models and proprietary discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of those instruments. The Funds net benefit or obligation under the derivative contract, as measured by the fair market value of the contract, is included in net assets.






	 










	The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of financial instruments for which market prices are not reliable or readily available. Under these procedures, the VLOC convenes on a regular basis to review such financial instruments and considers a number of factors, including significant unobservable valuation inputs, when arriving at fair value. The VLOC primarily employs a market-based approach which may use related or comparable assets or liabilities, recent transactions, market multiples, book values, and other relevant information for the investment to determine the fair value of the investment. An income-based valuation approach may also be used in which the anticipated future cash flows of the investment are discounted to calculate fair value. Discounts may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the investments. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuations of such investments, the fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market existed. The VLOC employs various methods for calibrating these valuation approaches including a regular review of key inputs and assumptions, transactional back-testing or disposition analysis, and reviews of any related market activity.




	Trading in securities on foreign securities stock exchanges and OTC markets may be completed before the daily close of business on the NYSE. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a foreign security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question the reliability of the value of a portfolio security held by the Fund. As a result, differences may arise between the value of the Funds portfolio securities as determined at the foreign market close and the latest indications of value at the close of the NYSE. In order to minimize the potential for these differences, the VLOC monitors price movements following the close of trading in foreign stock markets through a series of country specific market proxies (such as baskets of American Depositary Receipts, futures contracts and exchange traded funds). These price movements are measured against established trigger thresholds for each specific market proxy to assist in determining if an event has occurred that may call into question the reliability of the values of the foreign securities held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing services.




	In addition, certain foreign markets may be open on days that the NYSE is closed, which could result in differences between the value of the Funds portfolio securities on the last business day and the last calendar day of the reporting period. Any significant security valuation changes due to an open foreign market are adjusted and reflected by the Fund for financial reporting purposes.





	3. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS





	The Fund invested in derivatives in order to manage risk or gain exposure to various other investments or markets. Derivatives are financial contracts based on an underlying or notional amount, require no initial investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would normally be required to have a similar response to changes in market factors, and require or permit net settlement. Derivatives contain various risks including the potential inability of the counterparty to fulfill their obligations under the terms of the contract, the potential for an illiquid secondary market, and/or the potential for market movements.




	Derivative counterparty credit risk is managed through a formal evaluation of the creditworthiness of all potential counterparties. The Fund attempts to reduce its exposure to counterparty credit risk on OTC derivatives, whenever possible, by entering into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements with certain counterparties. These agreements contain various provisions, including but not limited to collateral requirements, events of default, or early termination. Termination events applicable to the counterparty include certain deteriorations in the credit quality of the counterparty. Termination events applicable to the Fund include failure of the Fund to maintain certain net asset levels and/or limit the decline in net assets over various periods of time. In the event of default or early termination, the ISDA master agreement gives the non-defaulting party the right to net and close-out all transactions traded, whether or not arising under the ISDA agreement, to one net amount payable by one counterparty to the other. Early termination by the counterparty may result in an immediate payment by the Fund of any net liability owed to that counterparty under the ISDA agreement.






	 










	Collateral requirements differ by type of derivative. Collateral terms are contract specific for OTC derivatives. For OTC derivatives traded under an ISDA master agreement, posting of collateral is required by either the fund or the applicable counterparty if the total net exposure of all OTC derivatives with the applicable counterparty exceeds the minimum transfer amount, which typically ranges from $100,000 to $250,000, and can vary depending on the counterparty and the type of the agreement. Generally, collateral is determined at the close of fund business each day and any additional collateral required due to changes in derivative values may be delivered by the fund or the counterparty within a few business days. Collateral pledged and/or received by the fund, if any, is held in segregated accounts with the funds custodian/counterparty broker and can be in the form of cash and/or securities. Unrestricted cash may be invested according to the Funds investment objectives.




	The Fund entered into OTC forward exchange contracts primarily to manage and/or gain exposure to certain foreign currencies. A forward exchange contract is an agreement between the Fund and a counterparty to buy or sell a foreign currency for a specific exchange rate on a future date.




	The Fund entered into credit default swap contracts primarily to manage exposure to credit risk. A credit default swap is an agreement between the Fund and a counterparty whereby the buyer of the contract receives credit protection and the seller of the contract guarantees the credit worthiness of a referenced debt obligation. These agreements may be privately negotiated in the over-the-counter market (OTC credit default swaps) or may be executed in a multilateral trade facility platform, such as a registered exchange (centrally cleared credit default swaps). The underlying referenced debt obligation may be a single issuer of corporate or sovereign debt, a credit index, or a tranche of a credit index. In the event of a default of the underlying referenced debt obligation, the buyer is entitled to receive the notional amount of the credit default swap contract from the seller in exchange for the referenced debt obligation, a net settlement amount equal to the notional amount of the credit default swap less the recovery value of the referenced debt obligation, or other agreed upon amount. For centrally cleared credit default swaps, required initial margin deposits of cash or securities are pledged by the Fund. Subsequent payments, known as variation margin, are made or received by the Fund, depending on fluctuations in the value of the underlying referenced debt obligation. Such variation margin is accounted for as unrealized appreciation or depreciation until the contract is closed, at which time the gains or losses are realized. Over the term of the contract, the buyer pays the seller a periodic stream of payments, provided that no event of default has occurred. Such periodic payments are accrued daily as an unrealized appreciation or depreciation until the payments are made, at which time they are realized. Payments received or paid to initiate a credit default swap contract represent compensating factors between stated terms of the credit default swap agreement and prevailing market conditions (credit spreads and other relevant factors). These upfront payments are amortized over the term of the contract as a realized gain or loss. The Fund did not hold any credit default swap contracts at period end.





	4. INCOME TAXES





	At


	August 31, 2013


	, the cost of investments and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for income tax purposes were as follows:








	 











	5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS





	The Fund follows a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and the Funds own market assumptions (unobservable inputs). These inputs are used in determining the value of the Funds financial instruments and are summarized in the following fair value hierarchy:





	Level 1  quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments




	Level 2  other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar financial


	instruments, interest rates, prepayment speed, credit risk, etc.)




	Level 3  significant unobservable inputs (including the Funds own assumptions in determining


	the fair value of financial instruments)





	The inputs or methodology used for valuing financial instruments are not an indication of the risk associated with investing in those financial instruments.




	For movements between the levels within the fair value hierarchy, the Fund has adopted a policy of recognizing the transfers as of the date of the underlying event which caused the movement.




	A summary of inputs used as of August 31, 2013, in valuing the Funds assets and liabilities carried at fair value, is as follows:







	a



	Includes common, preferred and convertible preferred stocks.




	b



	Includes securities determined to have no value at August 31, 2013.




	A reconciliation of assets in which Level 3 inputs are used in determining fair value is presented when there are significant Level 3 investments at the end of the period.





	6. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	The Fund has evaluated subsequent events through the issuance of the Statement of Investments and determined that no events have occurred that require disclosure.




	For additional information on the Fund's significant accounting policies, please refer to the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

Franklin High Income Trust v App Global, Ltd.

Annotate this Case






			
							

[*1]


Franklin High Income Trust v App Global, Ltd.


2004 NY Slip Op 51669(U)


Decided on June 23, 2004


Supreme Court, New York County


Cahn, J.


Published by New York State Law Reporting Bureau pursuant to Judiciary Law § 431.


This opinion is uncorrected and will not be published in the printed Official Reports.

Decided on June 23, 2004

Supreme Court, New York County
FRANKLIN HIGH INCOME TRUST, FRANKLIN UNIVERSAL TRUST, FRANKLIN CUSTODIAN FUNDS, INC., FRANKLIN TEMPLETON VARIABLE INSURANCE PRODUCTS TRUST, FRANKLIN MULTI- INCOME TRUST, and FRANKLIN STRATEGIC SERIES, Plaintiffs,
againstAPP GLOBAL, LTD., et al., Defendants.
602567/02


Herman Cahn, J.
As a preliminary matter, the court has raised the issue of whether plaintiffs' attorneys should be disqualified from also representing third-party defendants (Code of Professional Responsibility DR 5-105 [22 NYCRR § 1200.24]).[FN1]
Plaintiffs/investment funds (the "Franklin Funds") brought this action, alleging losses caused by misrepresentations of defendants, the issuers of securities in which plaintiffs invested. Defendants, thereafter, brought the third-party action against the third party defendants, Franklin Funds' investment advisers (the "Franklin Fund Advisers") for contribution. Defendants allege, inter alia, that the Franklin Fund Advisers were negligent in their overall management of [*2]the Funds, and thereby contributed to the Franklin Funds' losses. Based on these allegations, the third party plaintiffs seek contribution from Franklin Fund Advisers.
During a conference on June 2, 2004, the court was informed that counsel representing Franklin Funds herein, had also been retained by the Franklin Fund Advisers to undertake their defense of the third-party action. The court thereupon raised the issue of a possible conflict caused by the simultaneous representation of plaintiffs and third-party defendants, and sought submissions from the parties on this point. Upon deliberation, the court issues the following decision and order.
Simultaneous representation of "differing interests" in litigation is prohibited unless:
a disinterested lawyer would believe that the lawyer can competently
represent the interest of each and if each consents to the representation
after full disclosure of the implications of the simultaneous representation
and the advantages and risks involved.
(DR 5-105 [A]-[C].) "Because dual representation is fraught with the potential for irreconcilable conflict, it will rarely be sanctioned even after full disclosure has been had and the consent of the parties obtained." (Greene v Greene, 47 NY2d 447, 451-52 [1979].) "[W]ith rare and conditional exceptions, the lawyer may not place himself in a position where a conflicting interest may, even inadvertently, affect, or give the appearance of affecting, the obligations of the professional relationship." (Matter of Kelly, 23 NY2d 368, 376 [1968].) "[D]oubts as to the existence of a conflict of interest must be resolved in favor of disqualification." (Heelan v Lockwood, 143 AD2d 881, 883 [2d Dept 1988].)
The Franklin Funds have no independent, paid, employees, as evidenced by the Form 10-K, filed by Franklin Resources, Inc., with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Hine Aff. Ex. A at 12). Rather, plaintiffs/Franklin Funds are managed by distinct affiliates   third-party defendants/Franklin Advisers (id., Ex. B at 108, 111-12). Underlying the third-party complaint's claim for contribution is the allegation that the Franklin Advisers breached their managerial duties to the Franklin Funds by favoring other investment funds, and providing reckless advice, causing some of the economic injuries which the action-in-chief seeks to recoup from defendants (Third-Party Complaint ¶¶ 37-39). If this claim is proven, the Franklin Funds may possess an independent cause of action against Franklin Advisers, arising out of managerial neglect. Thus, the Franklin Funds and the Franklin Advisers represent potentially "differing interests" of the type which the Disciplinary Rule cautions against, in terms of simultaneous representation by counsel (DR 5-105 [A], [B]). A disinterested lawyer, or judge, would have doubts as to the ability of plaintiffs' counsel to completely represent both interests.
Plaintiffs' counsel's simultaneous representation of third-party defendants has the dangerous potential of compromising viable claims which the Franklin Funds may (or may not) have against the Franklin Advisors. For example, if there are settlement negotiations, Franklin Funds' counsel will be expected to press for the maximum recovery for plaintiffs. Franklin Advisers, on the other hand, may be in favor of a lesser recovery if it included a release of the third party claims. Such a possible conflict compromises the ability of the attorney to properly represent both parties. At a bare minimum, the Franklin Funds and the Franklin Advisers have [*3]differing, if not opposing, interests, by virtue of the claims asserted in the third-party complaint (see also, Boyd v Trent, 287 AD2d 475 [2d Dept 2001] [attorney disqualified from representing vehicle owner and passenger, due to the possibility of an independent claim by the passenger against the owner], appeal dismissed 98 NY2d 671 [2002]; Wood v Beacon Factors Corp., 137 AD2d 752 [2d Dept 1988] [attorney disqualified from representing multiple shareholders of a close corporation, due to the possibility of cross-claims among the shareholders]).
Plaintiffs' counsel submits what purport to be three "Consent[s] to Representation and Waiver[s] of Conflict," dated May 13, 2004   post-dating their appearance, seemingly, on behalf of third-party defendants (Banko Aff. Exs. C-E). All three were executed by Richard L. Kuersteiner, who identifies himself as Assistant Vice President of the Franklin Funds, and Associate General Counsel of Franklin Advisers (id.). Moreover, even if Kuersteiner demonstrated that he could, in a general sense, act on behalf of the Franklin Funds, he may not possess that capacity in this instance, given his simultaneous affiliation with the Franklin Advisers, as their Associate General Counsel (see, Rice v Baron, 456 F Supp 1361, 1376 [SD NY 1978] [rejecting consents to simultaneous representation on the ground that "[t]here is no indication of any participation by 'non-interested' directors in the execution of those corporate consents . . . ."]).
Finally, even if a proper representative of the Franklin Funds executed the consents, be it Kuersteiner or otherwise, this appears to be a case where the potential conflict is simply not waivable. As the Court of Appeals states, "where a lawyer represents parties whose interests conflict as to the particular subject matter, the likelihood of prejudice to one party may be so great that misconduct will be found despite disclosure and consent." (Matter of Kelly, supra, at 378.)
The court rejects plaintiffs' counsel's suggestion that a favorable disposition of third-party defendants' pending motion to dismiss would obviate the need to address the issue of disqualification. The grant of such a motion might well lead to an appeal, which would again require the third party defendant to be represented by counsel.
Accordingly, it is
ORDERED that Kostelanetz & Fink, LLP and Grant & Eisenhofer, P.A., plaintiffs' counsel, are disqualified from representing third-party defendants in this action; and it is further
ORDERED that third-party defendants' motion to dismiss (seq. no. 006) is denied, without prejudice to renew upon their retention of new counsel; and it is further
ORDERED that third-party defendants are afforded until the next conference date, August 2, 2004, at 9:30 a.m., to retain new counsel.
Dated:June 23, 2004

            Investing In The Fund
        

What Are the Risks?

All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
The risks associated with higher-yielding, lower-rated securities include higher risk of default and loss of principal.
Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond’s credit rating may affect its value. In addition, interest rate movements will affect the fund’s share price and yield.
Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Thus, as the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund’s share price may decline.
Investment in foreign securities also involves special risks, including currency fluctuations, and political and economic uncertainty.
These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund’s prospectus.

Total Returns include change in share price, assume reinvestment of all distributions, and reflect the deduction of fund expenses and applicable fees. Total Returns With Sales Charge: returns reflect the deduction of the stated sales charge. Total returns, distribution rate, and yields reflect any applicable expense reductions, without which the results for those impacted funds would have been lower.

Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
Most Franklin Templeton funds offer multiple share classes. Share classes are subject to different fees and expenses, which will affect their performance. In general, Class A shares have a maximum initial sales charge; Class C shares have a 1% contingent deferred sales charge; Class Z, Advisor Class and Class R6 shares have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees; Class R shares have no sales charges, but do have a Rule 12b-1 fee.
Performance data represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. Current performance may differ from figures shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of the range of a fund's total returns. In general, a higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Based on the fund's monthly returns over the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Percentage of the fund's returns explained by movements in the Credit Suisse High Yield Index. 100 equals perfect correlation to the index. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A measure of the fund's volatility relative to the market, as represented by the Credit Suisse High Yield Index. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the market. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
The fund's 30-day standardized yield is calculated over a trailing 30-day period using the yield to maturity on bonds and/or the dividends accrued on stocks. It may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate, which reflects the fund's past dividends paid to shareholders.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net Asset Value — The amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day.
Source: Morningstar®. The style box reveals a fund's investment style. For credit quality of the bonds owned, Morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies (only using ratings assigned by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization - "NRSRO") with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weighted-average credit quality is less than BBB-; medium are those less than AA- but greater or equal to BBB-; and high are those of AA- or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; average effective duration between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those at 125% or greater of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. Shaded areas show the past 3 years of quarterly data.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Source: Morningstar®. For each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance, and does not take into account the effects of sales charges, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Rating™ is for the named share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future performance.

The Gross Expense Ratio does not include a fee reduction related to the Fund's investment in a Franklin Templeton money fund and/or other Franklin Templeton fund, contractually guaranteed through 9/30/17. Fund investment results reflect the fee reduction; without this reduction, the results would have been lower. Please see the prospectus for additional information.
Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin California Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.
