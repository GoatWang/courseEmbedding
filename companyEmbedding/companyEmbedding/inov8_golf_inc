I've been pretty loyal to the Inov8 235's the last few years of doing Crossfit and these did not disappoint. I got the blue (which I would say is teal) and neon pink ones and I've been getting a lot of compliments. They aren't shoes that I wear when we have to do more than a mile of straight running in because of the lack of arch support but they are great for lifting, box jumps, and double unders.

Wanted to love these given the styling and how much I like my cross-training shoes from Inov-8. Unfortunately the size is still too small and tongue isn't padded enough for a light hiking boot.

I just love these shoes! I am a 56 year old woman and I walk anywhere from 2-5 miles per day. The majority of my walks are along pasture fields on mowed paths. These shoes are perfect for my "trail walks" especially when walking on dew-covered ground or after a rain.

I've worn the New Balance Minimus for about 10 years and this is my first pair of the Inov8's. These shoes have the same, great minimal feel I had in the Minimus, but the upper feels more secure and the rubber sole is much stronger. So far, they've held up great through rope climbs, long runs, sled pulls and all the other hell I've put them through. Great shoes!

I often have problems finding shoes for my wide feet. I bought these for Cross Fit and was reluctant because my other shoes were so comfortable that I did not want to have the discomfort of new shoes that I so often have. I was pleasantly surprised that these felt like a well broken-in shoe from the moment I put them on. They are perfect for all my workouts and I absolutely LOVE them!!

Bought for work & are extremely comfortable. However, if you are on your feet all day you will probably want a shoe with a bit more padding.

Fantastic grip in the mud and wet surfaces. I was so impressed with the way that I could just plow thru those types of obstacles. They feel so what rigid compared to normal running shoes but if your only doing a few miles of mud or obstacles, this is a great shoe to invest in. 





Roclite 325
Posted: 6/14/17
Reviewer: Chris from 
Overall: Rated: 4 stars!
Comfort: Rated:4 stars!
Style: Rated:4 stars!


These are some of my all time favorite shoes. I have the GTX version as well, and knew to get a half size larger than normal. Even with the half size up, they feel a little short during the break-in period. After break-in though, they are comfortable as I could ever want.
They are some of the lightest weight shoes for volume I've ever owned, yet they are just as supportive as I need.
The arches are neutral, which is good for me with flat feet.
They have a deep cut-out for the Achilles, which makes for great comfort and flexibility.
I've used them for day-to-day, while building a deck, mountain biking, playing chase with my dog, and walking in the woods. They are excellent in all situations.
The only improvement I can suggest is to make the front of the upper one set of eyelet loops higher.
I like them so much I wrote the company to beg them to never stop making them.

I bought these to replace my Inov8 f-lite 195s that I wear for CrossFit. The 195s are light, flexible, give good traction. I love them. These 215s have soles that are stiff as slabs of wood, the gray plastic side panels that the carry the laces are extra stiff and make getting the shoe on and off really difficult, and uncomfortable once the shoe is on. The shoe's collar is too high and rubs my ankle bones. To top it off, I usually take a 7.5, but since my 195s are 8s, that what I ordered, but they are too small.

Reviewer: Daisy Meyers from Seward, Alaska
Overall: Rated: 4 stars!
Comfort: Rated:4 stars!

I'm training for Mt. Marathon and ordered several shoes to find the right one. These had to become the right one because of my time frame and because that mountain is no joke. I had a hard time breaking these in only because my right foot is slightly larger than my left. Running down that mountain through the rocky chute, climbing down the cliffs, waterfalls, mud, has been so much better with these than I had thought, even if my right foot is a little not happy with me. It took some getting used to running on pavement but that is part of the race so be it. The best thing about these is their flexibility. I'm training to go up the roots part and where some areas are tricky, these have literally saved me.

This is my second pair of inov-8 Trail Talons. Wearing these shoes, I run the steep trails of the Pacific NW with great confidence. The TT250 is lightweight, provides good forefoot protection, and is very breathable. With little cushioning, however, these shoes are not comfortable on gravel or loose terrain. I haven't run further than 15 miles in these shoes, so I cannot say how well they perform on longer runs.

Overall, very disappointed with this shoe. I was looking for a shoe that had a little more padding in the sole compared to regular crossfit shoes. Not the case, basically the same thickness with a narrow toe box and heel which makes the shoes feel un-stable. I could easily see an ankle roll in the near future.
This shoe is definitely a "Precision Fit" not a "Standard Fit" cut.

Reviewer: Heather  from VT
Overall: Rated: 5 stars!
Comfort: Rated:5 stars!

Purchased these for lifting, HIIT and bootcamp classes. Very pleased with the look and performance of the sneaker. Extremely lightweight, good gripping sole for remaining sturdy while lifting. Good lateral support for HIIT and bootcamp classes. This is NOT a running sneaker, limited padding which is why I give it a 4 on comfort. I'm ok with it since the majority of my time is spent in the gym, just don't expect to be able to cross train with it. I have bunions and these sneakers accommodate because there is no seam on the side of the shoe. I wear a size 9 and they seem pretty true to size and don't make my feet look huge. Love the color and style. Only complaint is that I have to lace the sneakers for a high instep and the laces are pretty long and need to be double knotted. Otherwise, love the shoe!

Inov is an amazing brand. They are all I buy. The toe box gives a lot of splay room.

I returned these before I wore them outside but my overall impressions were that these would be great shoes for mud, sand, dirt, wet or dry leaves but NOT for sharp rocks or haphazard boulders since they have no protection on the sides at all, just mesh. Also I found the toe cap very light and flimsy with very little protection in the front as well. I'm looking for a good shoe for Yosemite and these would simply not do. Overall, the fit was spectacular. If you are doing muddies, Spartans or obstacles courses these would be perfect. Anything slightly unpredictable or treacherous I would suggest look elsewhere.

Reviewer:  from Seattle

The toebox is not really that wide, but it would be acceptable if not for a worse issue. The worst part is that the shoe curves in right where my big toe lives. That bends it out of alignment, which is not healthy. FYI, my big toe is my longest toe. I tried the next larger size, and there was way too much length and it was sloppy around my foot.
Other than this (critical) fit problem, I love Inov-8. Sadly, I cannot wear them.

This shoe fits, but after running in it, my toes hurt. Wondering if I can return even if I've worn them, it's like the toe box is too big and causes my toes to flex incorrectly.

Best footwear purchase I've made! I was looking for a shoe to mimic barefoot training to enhance mind-muscle connection and have better contact with the ground. These do exactly that. I've even worn them for outdoor road running and they were perfect for that as well. My calves were sore after the first few times wearing them but I've noticed a tremendous improvement in my balance and stability in my training since these enable me to really use my feet as a foundation.
My foot measures a 7.5 but I wear a 9 in training/running shoes. Bought these in a 9 and they were just right. Enough room for when my foot splays but not too big that I was tripping over them.

These fit really nice, but the lugs are way more aggressive than useful for most trails. Suited for mud, soft dirt, or loose gravel.

Ben Mounsey: Why I Run On Mountains & Trails















The world’s leading all terrain footwear

It was fell running that made inov-8, maturing in the wilderness of the Cumbrian mountains, the savagery of the terrain has shaped our performance footwear for multiple disciplines from performance training to the ultra marathon. All terrain runners are the unique breed who step off the map, tread outside convention and go beyond the lore.
