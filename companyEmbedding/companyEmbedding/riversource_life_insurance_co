Retire with more confidence
You may have the following concerns about meeting your retirement needs:

Will I have enough money to cover my expenses?
Will I have a steady, reliable income no matter what is happening in the market?
Will I be able to keep up with inflation and increasing healthcare costs?
Will my money last as long as I need it to?

While everyone's vision of retirement may be different, we all share the same basic goals to help us be financially prepared. Annuities are uniquely designed to offer the powerful combination of protection, tax deferral and guaranteed income in retirement.

Life Insurance




Protect tomorrow's possibilities today
Life insurance helps provide financial security to your family or others important you you and can help you create a confident retirement.
RiverSource® life insurance can help you:

Ensure survivor income. When structured properly, your beneficiaries will receive an income tax-free death benefit.1
Earn retirement income. Some RiverSource life insurance policies help you build cash value for future goals, such as retirement, by providing opportunities to participate in the growth potential of the market. Any potential earnings grow tax deferred, and you can access the cash value through income tax-free loans and withdrawals.
Transfer wealth. When you purchase a life insurance policy, you immediately secure a death benefit amount higher than the amount of premiums paid. Plus, instead of relying on asset growth, some life insurance policies offer the option of a lifetime guaranteed death benefit — helping you ensure your legacy.
Plan your estate. IRAs and 401(k)s are subject to income taxation when your beneficiaries access those assets after your death. Life insurance proceeds can help replace the amount of the legacy that is lost due to taxes.

1Generally the death benefit is income-tax free. For Income Protection Life a portion of the death benefit is taxable to the beneficiary.
All guarantees are based on the continued claims paying ability of the issuing company.
Accessing policy cash value through loans and surrenders may cause a permanent reduction of policy cash values and death benefit and negate any guarantees against lapse. The amount that can be borrowed or surrendered will be affected by the surrender charges applicable to the policy. Loans may be subject to interest charges. Although loans are generally not taxable, there may be tax consequences if the policy lapses or is surrendered with a loan (even as part of a 1035 exchange). It is possible that the amount of taxable income generated at the lapse or surrender of a policy with a loan may exceed the actual amount of cash received. Surrenders are generally taxable to the extent they exceed basis in the policy. If the policy is a modified endowment contract (MEC), pre-death distributions, including loans, from the policy are taxed on an income-first basis, and there may also be a 10% federal income tax penalty for distributions prior to age 59 ½.
Before you purchase, be sure to ask your financial advisor about the life insurance policy's features, benefits, risks and fees, and whether the life insurance is appropriate for you, based upon your financial situation and objectives. Variable life insurance is a complex investment vehicle that is subject to market risk, including the potential loss of principal invested.
