Mildred "Mit" Joyner
Pioneering Contributions
Mildred (Mit) Joyner has been a pioneer in teaching, research, writing, and community activism for more than 30 years, focusing on the areas of gerontology and multicultural issues.  Her work in gerontology education garnered recognition via the creation of the Mit Joyner Gerontology Leadership Award in 2005.  The award promotes leadership for undergraduate social work faculty and students in scholarship, best practices, and/or community connections.
 
Joyner established the first MSW program in the Pennsylvania state system of higher education.  She has also served in multiple leadership positions in nearly every social work professional organization, including the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), and the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW).
In 2010, Joyner was an invited presenter at a congressional briefing on the Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work Reinvestment Act.
Career Highlights
Mildred Joyner is Emerita Director and Professor of Social Work at West Chester University, positions she held for 25 years.  She arrived at West Chester University in 1981 as an assistant professor.
Joyner began her career as a child welfare worker and moved through a series of positions in the Chester County Children, Youth, and Families Agency.  She also served as Board Chair of Living Beyond Breast Cancer, a national education and support organization and on the Chester County Food Bank.
Biographic Data 
Joyner received her MSW from Howard University in 1974 and her BSW from Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, in 1971.
Significant Achievements and Awards 
Mildred Joyner is the first woman and African American to serve on the board of directors of DNB First (previously known as Downingtown National Bank), where she was appointed in 2004. She is a member of the board of Chester County Food Bank, and the Dana Farber Cancer Institutes SoulMates Advisory Board in Boston, MA and the Book Committee of NASW.  Mit currently is the President and Owner of MCJ Consultants in West Chester, PA. 
Joyner is the past President of the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), the sole accrediting body for baccalaureate and master social work programs in the United States, Puerto Rico and Guam.  As President and Board Chair of CSWE, she served on the board of the International Association for Schools of Social Work (IASSW), and represented the United States social work education body internationally.  Joyner received numerous awards in the fields of social work, gerontology, education, and leadership.  AGE-SW and BPD created the Mit Joyner Gerontology Leadership Award in her honor in 2005 for her leadership in the field of gerontology.  In March 2011, Joyner received the BPD Lifetime to Achievement Award.  She was recognized for her leadership and stewardship in 2011 by Living Beyond Breast Cancer, the Dr. Inabel Burns Lindsay Award in 2012. In 2013, Joyner was named a Social Work Pioneer by NASW. Most recently in October of 2014, Joyner was named the First William Culp lecturer by Abilene Christian University, School of Social Work in Abilene, Texas. 
Joyner received the NASW's Pennsylvania Chapter/Brandywine Division’s Social Worker of the Year Award in 1997.  The award was given, in part, in recognition of work on behalf of advancing racial and social harmony.

Description



Critical Multicultural Social Work is the first book to explore multicultural practice from a critical perspective. The authors provide tools and techniques that enable readers to recognize their own perspectives and find meaning and importance in what they learn. The text examines oppression and diversity across multiple dimensions, including race and ethnicity, gender, sex and sexual orientation, and ability/disability. In addition to presenting the history of diversity as well as a basic framework for evaluating the issue, the authors guide practitioners through enlightened self-reflection to encourage awareness and sensitivity as they work with clients.

			Mildred C. Joyner, MSW, LCSW, BCD, age 67, has been a Director since 2004 and currently serves as Chair of the Wealth Management Committee and serves on the Nominating & Corporate Governance and Audit Committees. Ms. Joyner has been the President of MCJ Consultants since January 2011 and is an Emeritus Professor of Social Work from West Chester University of Pennsylvania where she started her teaching career in 1979. While at West Chester University as a Professor of Social Work, she was elected in 1984 as the Director/Chairperson of the Undergraduate Social Work Department and served in that position until 2011. In 2010, Ms. Joyner chaired the fundraising committee for the Frederick Douglass sculpture which is permanently located on the campus of West Chester University. Ms Joyner was elected in 2015 as Vice-President of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) which serves over 130,000 members throughout the United States. She also serves on the boards of the Chester County Food Bank, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute SoulMates advisory board in Boston, MA. She previously served on the boards of the Congressional Research Institute for Social Work and Policy in Washington, DC, the International Association of Schools of Social Work, the ANSWER Coalition, Chester County Children, Youth, and Families, the Chester County Women's Commission, and the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) in Alexandria, VA as the President and Board Chair from July 2010 to June 2013. Ms. Joyner is a Chair Emeritus of Living Beyond Breast Cancer in Narberth, PA where she previously served as the Board Chair and as the Chair of Board Governance. In addition, Ms. Joyner also served as the Vice-President of CSWE, and is a past President of the Association of Baccalaureate Social Work Program Directors, a national organization located in Alexandria, VA. Ms. Joyner earned her BSW in 1971 from Central State University in Ohio and a MSW in 1974 from Howard University in Washington, DC. As a result of these leadership positions and other professional experiences, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee believes that Ms. Joyner's qualifications to serve on the Board includes her considerable knowledge and experience acquired while directing a major department at the largest university in Chester County. In addition, the Committee believes that Ms. Joyner's background in community based service provides the Board with a unique perspective and insight regarding the needs of local consumers and strengthens the Board's collective qualifications, skills and experience.
