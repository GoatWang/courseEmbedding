	The
	accompanying interim unaudited financial statements of Tiger Oil and Energy, Inc. (a Nevada corporation) are condensed and,
	therefore, do not include all disclosures normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America. These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s most recent annual financial statements
	for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in a 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
	(“SEC”) on April 14, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have
	been included in the accompanying interim financial statements and consist of only normal recurring adjustments. The results
	of operations presented in the accompanying interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
	necessarily indicative of the operating results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.

	Notes to
	Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements




	September
	30, 2016




	(Unaudited)




	 





	NOTE
	1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
	(which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and
	cash flows at September 30, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made.




	 




	Certain
	information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial
	statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's December 31, 2015
	audited financial statements. The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily
	indicative of the operating results for the full year.




	 





	NOTE
	2 – GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable
	to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
	The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue
	as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital
	to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced
	to cease operations.




	 




	In
	order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management's plan
	is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet
	its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that
	the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.




	 




	The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
	in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.




	 





	NOTE
	3 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates.

	(Unaudited)




	 





	NOTE
	3 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)





	 





	Consolidation





	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements included all of the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
	C2R, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, and Jett Rink Oil, LLC, a Kansas Limited Liability Company. All intercompany transactions have
	been eliminated.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	Management
	has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of the Company’s financial statements.
	The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the
	Company’s financial statements.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents include cash in banks and financial instruments which mature within six months of the date of purchase.




	 





	Oil
	and Gas Properties





	 




	The
	Company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all acquisition, exploration
	and development costs, including certain payroll, asset retirement costs, other internal costs, and interest incurred for the
	purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves, are capitalized. Internal costs that are capitalized are directly attributable
	to acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include costs related to production, general corporate overhead
	or similar activities. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred.
	Proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are applied to reduce the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties
	unless the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case a gain
	or loss is recognized.





	 





	Capitalized
	costs associated with impaired properties and capitalized costs related to properties having proved reserves, plus the
	estimated future development costs, and asset retirement costs under Financial Accounting Standards Board
	(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 410 “Asset Retirement and
	Environmental Obligations” (FASB ASC 410), are amortized using the unit-of-production method based on proved
	reserves. Capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and deferred income taxes, are
	limited to the total of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at ten percent,
	plus the cost of unevaluated properties.  Under certain specific conditions, companies could elect to use
	subsequent prices for determining the estimated future net cash flows. The use of subsequent pricing is no longer allowed.
	There are many factors, including global events that may influence the production, processing, marketing and price of oil and
	natural gas. A reduction in the valuation of oil and natural gas properties resulting from declining prices or production
	could adversely impact depletion rates and capitalized cost limitations. Capitalized costs associated with properties that
	have not been evaluated through drilling or seismic analysis, including exploration wells in progress at September 30, 2016,
	are excluded from the unit-of-production amortization. Exclusions are adjusted annually based on drilling results and
	interpretative analysis.

	NOTE
	3 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)






	 






	Oil
	and Gas Properties (Continued)





	 




	Sales
	of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to the net full cost pool with no gain or loss recognized,
	unless the adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. If it is determined
	that the relationship is significantly altered, the corresponding gain or loss will be recognized in the statements of operations.





	  





	Costs
	of oil and gas properties are depleted using the unit-of-production method. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
	the Company recognized $-0- and $-0-, respectively, of depletion expense related to oil and gas production during the period.





	 






	Ceiling
	Test






	 





	In
	applying the full cost method, the Company performs an impairment test (ceiling test) at each reporting date, whereby the carrying
	value of property and equipment is compared to the value of its proved reserves discounted at a ten percent interest rate of future
	net revenues, based on current economic and operating conditions, plus the cost of properties not being amortized, plus the lower
	of cost or fair market value of unproved properties included in costs being amortized, less the income tax effects related to
	book and tax basis differences of the properties.  




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition






	 





	Revenues
	from the sale of oil and natural gas are recognized when the product is delivered at a fixed or determinable price, title has
	transferred, and collectability is reasonably assured.  For oil sales, this occurs when the customer takes delivery of oil
	from the operators’ storage tanks.




	 





	Loss
	per Share






	 





	The
	Company has adopted ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share,” (“EPS”) which requires presentation of basic and
	diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures, and requires a
	reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted
	EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the
	weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company had 1,200,000 potential dilutive
	shares of common stock as of September 30, 2016 that were excluded as their effect was anti-dilutive.





	 






	NOTE
	4 – OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES





	 




	On
	April 3, 2014, the Company signed an election to participate in the first of three wells with Toto Energy, LLC in Cowley County,
	Kansas. The Company will earn a 30 percent working interest and a 24.45 percent net royalty interest in the well. The Company
	capitalized $213,000 of cash payments made to commence operations development of the well.

	NOTE
	4 – OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES (CONTINUED)





	 




	On
	May 10, 2014, the Company signed an election to participate in the second of three wells with Toto Energy, LLC in Cowley County,
	Kansas. The Company will earn a 30 percent working interest and a 24.45 percent net royalty interest in the well. The Company
	capitalized $189,000 of cash payments made to commence operations development of the well.




	 




	On
	July 23, 2016 the Company received $58,684 from the operator of two of its oil and gas leases. The payment received represented
	a partial refund of the Company’s previous $404,837 in payments made to the operator pursuant to the terms of an Authorization
	for Expenditures (“AFE”) Agreement. The Company’s original payments under the AFE were capitalized to oil and
	gas properties in 2014. All capitalized costs pursuant to the AFE were fully impaired during the year ended December 31, 2015.
	As the capitalized costs had been previously impaired, the $58,684 was recorded as a gain on property settlement for the period
	ended September 30, 2016.




	 




	Oil
	and gas properties are stated at cost. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, oil and gas properties, net consisted

	NOTE
	5 – CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE






	 





	On
	January 3, 2014, the Company received $600,000 in connection with a convertible note financing commitment, the terms of which
	call for the Company to receive three tranches of $200,000 each on a callable convertible note wherein the Company borrows the
	sum at five percent interest for one year and the investor can elect to continue to receive the interest on the note or have the
	Company issue the investor shares of common stock of the Company at $0.50 per share to retire the debt. The notes came due on
	December 12, 2014, and as of September 30, 2016 the notes were in default. At September 30, 2016 accrued interest on the notes
	totaled $82,137.




	 





	NOTE
	6 – NOTES PAYABLE – RELATED PARTY





	 




	On
	June 11, 2015 the Company borrowed $5,000 from a related-party entity. Pursuant to the terms of the note, the principal accrues
	interest at a rate of five percent per annum, is unsecured, and is due in full on June 11, 2016. Subsequent to the initial borrowing
	the Company borrowed an additional $57,500 from the same lender under the same terms. On July 25, 2016 the Company paid $40,000
	against the outstanding principal of the notes. Accrued interest totaling $1,340 was forgiven at the time of payment, and recorded as additional paid-in capital. At September
	30, 2016 the total outstanding principal balance due to the lender was $22,500, and aggregate accrued interest on the notes totaled
	$182.

	NOTE
	6 – NOTES PAYABLE – RELATED PARTY (CONTINUED)





	 




	On
	May 6, 2015 the Company borrowed $5,000 from an unrelated third-party entity. Pursuant to the terms of the note, the principal
	accrues interest at a rate of five percent per annum, is unsecured, and is due in full on May 6, 2016. On July 25, 2015 the note,
	inclusive of all unpaid principal and interest, was transferred to and assumed by a related party. On July 25, 2016 the Company
	repaid the full $5,000 principal balance due under the terms of the note. Accrued interest on the note totaling $305 was forgiven
	at the time of payment, and recorded as additional paid-in capital. As of September 30, 2016 the note principal and interest have
	been satisfied in full.




	 




	On
	March 7, 2016 the Company borrowed $10,000 from a related-party. Pursuant to the terms of the note the principal accrues interest
	at a rate of five percent per annum, is unsecured, and is due in full on May 6, 2017. On May 2, 2016 the Company borrowed an additional
	$4,000 under the same terms. At September 30, 2016 the principal balances of the notes totaled $14,000 and accrued interest on
	the notes totaled $366.




	 





	NOTE
	7 – ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS






	 





	The
	total future asset retirement obligation is estimated by management based on the Company’s net working interests in all
	wells and facilities, estimated costs to reclaim and abandon wells and facilities and the estimated timing of the costs to be
	incurred in future periods. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company estimated the undiscounted cash flows related
	to asset retirement obligation to total approximately $105,500. The actual costs to settle the obligation are expected to occur
	in approximately 25 years. Through September 30, 2016, the Company established an asset retirement obligation of $9,860 for the
	wells acquired by the Company, which was capitalized to the value of the oil and gas properties. The fair value of the liability
	at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is estimated to be $12,113 and $11,534, respectively, using a risk free rate of 9.31
	percent and inflation rates between 3.87 and 4.81 percent. Total accretion expense on the asset retirement obligation was $579
	and $530 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.




	  





	NOTE
	8 – STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT






	 





	The
	Company has 1,000,000 preferred shares authorized at a par value of $0.001 and 74,000,000 common shares authorized at par value
	of $0.001.  As of September 30, 2016 the Company has 42,013 shares of preferred stock and 42,728,159 shares of common
	stock issued and outstanding.  




	 




	On
	July 29, 2016 the Company repaid in full the principal balance of multiple related-party notes payable. Pursuant to this transaction,
	the note holders agreed to forgive an aggregate of $1,645 in accrued interest related to the notes. The Company recorded this
	forgiveness as a credit to additional paid-in capital, as the note holders were related parties.





	 






	NOTE
	9 – RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS






	 





	At
	September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company owed its Chief Financial Officer $25,000 and $16,000, respectively, in
	accrued director fees. An additional $2,000 was owed to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer in accrued director fees
	and notes payable.

	NOTE
	10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES






	 





	During
	the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company became party to a legal action brought about by an unrelated third-party
	individual, wherein the plaintiff alleges the Company “participated and/or conspired in a scheme to disseminate spam
	emails” which were misleading in order to encourage individuals to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock
	at an artificial and/or inflated stock price. As of September 30, 2016, the Company elected to record a contingent liability
	in the amount of $11,000 as the likelihood of a negotiated settlement agreement appeared high.

	Item
	2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.





	  




	This
	10Q contains certain forward-looking statements and our future operating results could differ materially from those discussed
	herein. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual
	results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed
	or implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
	such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to announce publicly the results of
	any revisions of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.




	 





	Going
	Concern






	 





	The
	future of our company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations from the sale of
	products and services through our websites. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement and public
	offering of its common stock, if necessary. Our auditors have included a going concern paragraph in their audit report dated April
	13, 2016 included in our annual report on Form 10-K because uncertainties raise doubts about the Issuers ability to continue as
	a going concern.




	 






	Corporate
	Overview








	 






	Unless
	otherwise indicated, in this 10Q, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,”
	“TGRO” refer to Tiger Oil and Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (formerly UTEC, Inc.). Future plans include the exploration,
	development and production of oil and gas in the United States. Our current focus is to secure financing to increase our holdings
	and develop our current oil and gas assets over the next twelve months.




	 




	The
	Company through its acquisition of Jett Rink LLC owns interests in two oil and gas wells for approximately 50 acres located in
	Creek County, State of Oklahoma, together with any personal property and lease equipment located thereon. These two wells are
	shut-in and produce no revenue.




	 




	On
	April 9, 2014 we elected to partner with TOTO Energy LLC and drill our first well on the Cowley County leases. The Company paid
	$24,000 for a 30% WI in the Stalnaker lease and agreed to spend $239,000 for our share of drilling costs of the Stalnaker 17-1
	well. (paid). The operator intends to frac this well in the late spring of 2015.




	 




	On
	May 10, 2014 we elected to partner with TOTO Energy LLC and drill our second well on the Cowley County leases. The Company holds
	a 30% WI in the DeFore lease and agreed to spend $189,000 for our share of drilling costs of the DeFore 19-1 well. (paid). This
	well was fracked and is producing oil and revenue to the Company, although due in part to low oil prices the DeFore well did not
	produce or earn revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.




	 




	Our
	current focus is to secure financing to increase our holdings and develop our current oil and gas assets over the next twelve
	months.




	 






	For
	the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, and 2015






	 





	Revenues





	Revenues
	for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $-0-, compared to $1,980 for the comparable period of 2015. This decrease
	resulted from a decrease in the oil and gas production from the Company’s Defore 19-1 well that commenced during 2015. No
	oil and gas was produced during the three months ended September 30, 2016, due in part to low oil prices. As oil prices increase
	the Company anticipates increased production and revenues will be derived from the DeFore well.

	Operating
	Expenses




	 



	Operating
	expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $58,154 and 8,256, respectively. The majority of these
	expenses related to professional fees totaling $29,612 and $3,450, respectively,general and administrative expenses totaling
	$16,575 and $4,536, respectively,and judgment expense of $11,000 and $-0- for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
	2015. Professional fees increased during the current period primarily due to an increase in legal fees relating to legal
	defense and subsequent negotiation of a legal settlement. General and administrative expenses increased during the current
	period, due primarily to an $11,000 write-down of the Company’s DeFore and Stalnaker wells. The Company also recognized
	accretion expense of $198 and $181 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as well as lease
	operating expenses of $769 and $89 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.




	 





	Other
	Income (Expenses)






	 





	During
	the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized interest expense in the amount of $10,575 and $7,688,
	respectively. Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in notes payable upon which interest accrues. Additionally,
	the Company recorded a gain on property settlement in the amount of $58,684 during the current period, relating to a refund of
	funds paid toward oil and gas properties.




	 





	Net
	Loss






	 





	For
	the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized a net loss in the amounts of $10,045 and $13,964, respectively.
	The slight decrease in net loss was largely the result of the decreased revenues coupled with increased other income, partially
	offset by increased operating expenses during the current period.




	 






	For
	the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016, and 2015







	 






	Revenues





	 




	Revenues
	for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $-0-, compared to $11,643 for the comparable period of 2015. This decrease
	resulted from a decrease in the oil and gas production from the Company’s Defore 19-1 well that commenced during 2015. No
	oil and gas was produced during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due in part to low oil prices. As oil prices increase
	the Company anticipates increased production and revenues will be derived from the DeFore well.




	 





	Operating
	Expenses






	 





	Operating
	expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $96,173 and 43,239, respectively. The majority of these
	expenses related to general and administrative expenses totaling $30,023 and $21,036, respectively, and legal and professional expenses
	totaling $53,802 and $21,147, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Professional fees
	increased during the current period primarily due to increased legal fees. General and administrative expenses increased
	during the current period, due primarily to an increase in transfer agent fees and to an $11,000 write-down of the
	Company’s DeFore and Stalnaker wells. The Company also recognized accretion expense of $579 and $530 during the nine
	months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as well as lease operating expenses of $769 and $526 for the
	nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.




	 





	Other
	Income (Expenses)






	 





	During
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized interest expense in the amount of 26,761 and
	$25,903, respectively. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the Company amortizing the debt discount of convertible
	debt to interest expense during 2015. Additionally, the Company recorded a gain on property settlement in the amount of
	$58,684 during the current period, relating to a refund of funds paid toward oil and gas properties.

	Net
	Loss






	 





	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized a net loss in the amounts of $64,250 and $57,499, respectively.
	The increased net loss was largely the result of the increased operating expenses, partially offset by increased other income during
	the current period.




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources






	 





	As
	of September 30, 2016, the Company had $977 in current assets, consisting of $777 in cash, and deposits of $200, compared to $15,247
	in current assets at December 31, 2015, which consisted of cash of $15,047 and deposits of $200. Total liabilities at September
	30, 2016 totaled $799,047 compared to $750,712 at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 the Company had a current ratio of
	0.01.




	 




	The
	Company estimates that it will require $400,000 to accomplish its short-term goal of bringing shut-in wells back into production
	and the company's sole source of liquidity to this point has been through the sale of common stock. Such funding that is required
	to maintain liquidity will come in the form of equity sales of common stock.




	 




	Cash
	used in operations totaled $69,454 and $26,507 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
	increase in cash used in operations results primarily from an increased net loss for the period. Cash provided by investing
	activities totaled $58,684 and


	$-0-, respectively, and cash provided by (used
	in) financing activities totaled $(3,500) and $10,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
	2015, respectively.

	EVALUATION
	OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 




	As
	of September 30, 2016 under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated the
	effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a — 15(e) under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph
	(b) of Sec. 240.13a-15 or 240.15d-15 the disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.




	 




	The
	Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
	us in our reports filed under the securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
	specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that this information
	is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
	to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	  




	CHANGES
	IN INTERNAL CONTROLS.




	 




	There
	was no change in our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls during our last fiscal quarter that
	has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	The
	Company has not taken any steps at this time to address these weaknesses but will formulate a plan before fiscal year ending December
	31, 2016.

	CERTIFICATION
	PURSUANT TO






	18
	U.S.C. ss 1350, AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO






	SECTION
	302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002





	 




	I,
	Kenneth B. Liebscher, certify that:




	 




	1.
	I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Tiger Oil and Energy, Inc.




	 




	2.
	Based on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to date a material
	fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
	with respect to the period covered by this quarterly report;




	 




	3.
	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present
	in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the small business issuer as of, and
	for, the periods presented in this quarterly report;




	 




	4.
	The small business issuer’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure
	controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(3)) and internal control over financial reporting
	(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) for the small business issuer and have:




	 







	a.



	Designed
	such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the small business issuer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
	to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which the report is being prepared;






	 







	b.



	Designed
	such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
	our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
	statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;






	 







	c.



	Evaluated
	the effectiveness of the small business issuer’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
	such evaluation; and






	 







	d.



	Disclosed
	in this report any change in the small business issuer’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
	the small business issuer’s most recent fiscal quarter (the small business issuer’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case
	of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the small business issuer’s
	internal control over financial reporting; and






	 




	5.
	The small business issuer's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
	over financial reporting, to the small business issuer's auditors and the audit committee of the small business issuer's board
	of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):




	 




	(a)
	all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the small business issuer's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
	information; and




	 




	(b)
	any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the small business
	issuer's internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public.
