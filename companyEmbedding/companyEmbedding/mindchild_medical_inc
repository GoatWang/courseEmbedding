MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System
MERIDIAN's patented technology is FDA cleared to take the place of not only Doppler and tocometry, but also fetal scalp electrode and the intrauterine pressure catheter. It is no longer necessary to weigh the advantage of invasive monitoring with the risk of infection: MERIDIAN M110 provides gold-standard signal without the risk of invasive monitoring. At a time when the average BMI of obstetric patients is rising, and clinical excellence demands reliable fetal heart rate and contraction signals from all patients, MERIDIAN M110 is the only fetal monitor on the market that performs as well in obese patients as it does in lean patients. Both the fetal heart rate signal and the contraction signal deteriorate when BMI increases, compromising obstetric safety. MERIDIAN M110 solves this problem with improved technology, raising the safety profile of your unit.

MERIDIAN M110 Disposable Electrode Patch
The MERIDIAN M110 Disposable Electrode Patch eliminates the need for skin preparation before use while providing outstanding performance and reliability across the full range of patient BMI anticipated during labor and delivery. The MERIDIAN M110 Disposable Electrode Patch replaces the fetal scalp electrode, intrauterine pressure catheter, Dopper, and TOCO sensors with a single non-invasive disposable system, while maintaining the same accuracy and sensitivity performance expected of today’s monitoring devices. Frequent repositioning associated with existing non-invasive monitoring is eliminated, as well as the risk of infection associated with invasive monitoring.
The MERIDIAN M110 Disposable Electrode Patch consists of four patches, two for the mother’s abdomen and one for each of her sides, which provides continuous fetal signal capture during fetal movement. With complete abdominal coverage, the Meridian M110 Disposable Electrode Patch delivers accurate and detailed fetal, maternal, and uterine monitoring, setting a new gold standard in fetal monitoring sensor technology.

MERIDIAN M110 Monitors the Fetal ECG
Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring has been widely used on adult patients for decades. In adults, signals representing a patient’s cardiac activities are collected through a set of skin surface electrodes distributed over the patient’s body.
Monitoring of fetal ECG (fECG) in this manner, however, can be difficult due to the co-existence of maternal and fetal signals acquired from a patient, as well as the relatively low fetal signal level relative to the maternal signal and other noise sources. MindChild has developed the MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System which is a device that utilizes external electrodes and a proprietary algorithm to discern between fetal and maternal signals allowing for an external, non-invasive device to calculate the fetal heart rate.
The MERIDIAN M110 FHR Sentinel Monitoring
The MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System overcomes a major safety hazard of traditional monitoring - the inability of Doppler technology to distinguish the maternal heart rate from the fetal heart rate when the mother and and the fetus's heart rates are similar. By tracking each signal independently, using a dedicated maternal ECG lead, MERIDIAN M110 FHR SentinelTM technology eliminates the risk.







MERIDIAN M110 Improves Quality of Interaction Between Nurse and Mother
The Meridian M110 eliminates the nursing time required to reposition the fetal monitoring transducer. The MERIDIAN M110 monitor eliminates transducer adjustment by automating sensor selection within the Meridian M110 Disposable Electrode Patch. In fact workflow analysis suggests that use of MERIDIAN M110 reduces nursing work by 1-2 hours per labor episode. This advantage is particularly pronounced when monitoring obese patients: fetal movement, maternal position, and adipose tissue conspire to make fetal monitoring a full-time job for the covering nurse. MERIDIAN M110 eliminates this hands-on work, freeing nursing staff to focus on more important aspects of patient care.

Versus Established Technologies













Indications for Use
The MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System is an intrapartum fetal monitor that externally measures and displays fetal heart rate (FHR), maternal heart rate (MHR), and uterine contractions (UA). The MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System acquires and displays the FHR and UA from abdominal surface electrodes that detect the fetal ECG signals, maternal ECG signals, and of uterine muscle contraction signals. Tracings of FHR and UA are displayed onto a primary fetal monitor.
The MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System is indicated for use on women who are at ≥ 37 completed weeks, in labor, with singleton pregnancies, using surface electrodes on the maternal abdomen. The MindChild MERIDIAN M110 is intended for use by health care professionals in a clinical setting.

Results:
The difference between the T/R ratio calculated from the scalp electrode and the T/R ratio calculated from the extracted abdominal fetal ECG was 0.0064 ± 0.014. This difference is not clinically meaningful.
Conclusion:
We measured the fetal T/R ratio was accurately measured using abdominal electrodes in non-ischemic fetuses.

Variation in T/R ratio between
FSE and abdominal sensors.
 
 





Background:
Evaluation of the T/R ratio - themetric used by the STAN™monitor - improves the accuracy of intra-partum fetal assessment when combined with fetal heart rate monitoring, but typically requires a fetal scalp electrode (FSE). Noninvasive measurement of the T/R ratio would make this metric more widely available.
Objective:
To compare fetal T/R ratio measured using sensors on the maternal abdomen to the fetal T/R ratio acquired using a FSE.
Methods:
Data were acquired from 27 term laboring women who had a FSE placed for a clinical indication. 31 channels of abdominal data were recorded simultaneously with the FSE.
The average T/R ratio level was estimated from 79 30-second segments from the FSE and the abdominal data for 4 subjects. A comparison was performed to assess the correlation between the fetal T/R ratio derived from abdominal sensors and T/R ratio measured using the FSE.

Objective:
To compare fetal ST-segment deviation measured using sensors on the maternal abdomen to the fetal ST-segment deviation acquired using a fetal scalp electrode (FSE).
 
Methods:
Data were acquired from 27 termlaboring women who had a FSE placed for a clinical indication. 29 channels of abdominal data and one precordial channel were recorded simultaneously with the FSE. The data were preprocessed for removal of interference from maternal ECG as well as power‐line contamination and other sources of background noise, such as muscle artifact.
The median ST level was estimated from 79 10-second segments fro the FSE and abdominal data.
 
 
 
 
 




Methods (cont'd):
The statistical comparison was performed to access the accuracy of the ST-segment deviation (elevation or depression) derived from the abdominal sensors compared to the FSE.
IRB approved and informed consent were obtained.




Results:
ST elevation from the isoelectric point ranged from 0-2% of R-wave amplitude. ST depression ranged from 0-1.5% of R-wave amplitude. The route mean square error between the ST deviation calculated by both methods averaged over all processed segments was 0.52%, and the mean absolute difference was 0.29%.




Conclusion:
ST deviation calculated from ECG acquired from the maternal abdomen is clinically indistinguishable from ST-segment deviation measured using the fetal scalp electrode (FSE).

Fetal Heart Rate





















Making labor safer for women and their babies











Accuracy of Fetal Heart Rate Acquired from Sensors on the Maternal Abdomen Compared to a Fetal Scalp Electrode



















Objective:
To compare fetal heart rate measured using electrodes on the maternal abdomen to the fetal rate acquired using the fetal scalp electrode (FSE).
 
Methods:
Data were acquired from 27 termlaboring women who had a FSE placed for a clinical indication. 29 channels of abdominal data and one chest lead were recorded simultaneously with the FSE. The data were preprocessed for removal of interference from maternal ECG as well as power‐line contamination and other sources of background noise, such as muscle artifact.




Methods (cont'd):
Signal quality measures were used to select regions of usable data from both the scalp and abdominal electrodes. A total of 542 10‐second segments,sampled every 30 seconds, werechosen from the FSE and thepreprocessed abdominal data.
The associated median fetal heart rate was calculated in each segment of the abdominal and scalp data. A statistical
comparison between the fetal heart rate calculated in simultaneous segments of abdominal and scalp data was performed. This allowed us to access the accuracy of the fetal heart rate recorded from abdominal sensors compated to the "gold standard," FSE.




Results:
The fetal heart rate was successfully extracted from the FSE from 85.6 percent of analyzed segments, and 83.3 percent of analyzed segments recorded using abdominal sensors.
The root mean square error between the fetal heart rate sequence calculated by both methods averaged over all processes segments was 0.35 beat per minute.




Conclusion:
FHR acquired from the maternal abdomen is highly accurate and on average is clinically indistinguishable from FHR calculated using the fetal scalp electrode data. Furthermore, using our method, abdominal fetal ECG is useful for FHR estimation almost as often as datafrom scalp electrode data. Our method can be used as a reliable alternative to the FSE for automated FHR reporting and noisy data rejection.

About the Fetal Heart Monitoring Market


      Over 85%7 of the 4,000,0008 live births occurring 
      in the US during 2011 required fetal monitoring during labor and 
      delivery. Current non‐invasive Doppler, employing ultrasound to detect 
      FHR is subject to loss of fetal heart rate due to maternal/fetal movement9. 
      Fetal Scalp Electrodes (FSE) that connect directly to the fetus during 
      the later stages of labor and delivery are associated with increased 
      risk of maternal/fetal infection10. There are an estimated 
      28,000 fetal monitors spread over 3,400 hospitals in the US11, 
      representing an investment of over $700,000,00012. MERIDIAN 
      has been developed to provide uninterruptible fECG data while addressing 
      the deficiencies in both Doppler and FSE via innovative non‐invasive 
      monitoring technology.

About the Fetal Heart Monitoring Market
Over 85% of the 4,000,000 live births occurring in the US during 2011 required fetal monitoring during labor and delivery. Current non-invasive Doppler, employing ultrasound to detect FHR, is subject to loss of fetal heart rate due to maternal/fetal movement. Fetal Scalp Electrodes (FSE) that connect directly to the fetus during the later stages of labor and delivery are associated with increased risk of maternal/fetal infection. There are an estimated 28,000 fetal monitors spread over 3,400 hospitals in the US, representing an investment of over $700,000,000. MERIDIAN M110 has been developed to provide interruptible fECG data while addressing the deficiencies in both Doppler and FSE via innovative non-invasive monitoring technology.

MindChild Medical, Inc. Announces Publication of "Evaluation of the 
      fetal QT interval using non-invasive fetal ECG technology" With the 
      MERIDIAN™ Fetal Monitoring System




      The MERIDIAN Fetal Monitoring System Enables Non-Invasive Fetal, 
      Maternal Heart Rate and Uterine Contraction Monitoring Using Surface 
      Electrodes
    





April 10, 2017 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NORTH ANDOVER, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MindChild Medical, Inc. today announced publication of "Evaluation of 
      the fetal QT interval using non-invasive fetal ECG technology" in the 
      Journal of Physiological Measurement.1 The evaluation was 
      conducted by investigators at Technion-IIT, University of Oxford, Tufts 
      Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, Seattle Children’s Hospital, 
      Brigham and Women’s Hospital, MindChild Medical, Emory University and 
      Georgia Institute of Technology. Utilizing MERIDIAN non-invasive fetal 
      electrocardiography (NI-FECG) technology enables accurate extraction of 
      the fetal QT interval. According to senior author, Gari D. Clifford, PhD2,3, 
      “These results provide evidence that non-invasive fetal 
      electrocardiography (NI-FECG) technology enables accurate extraction of 
      the fetal QT interval.” Dr. Clifford continued, “Fetal QT interval 
      changes are critical in managing fetal health. The ability to extract 
      high quality fetal QT intervals may have profound diagnostic 
      implications and provide insight to proactive fetal management.” Long QT 
      syndrome (LQTS) has been shown to be a major determinant in young sudden 
      death individuals for which an autopsy was performed but had remained 
      inconclusive4 and a determinant for as much as 10% of sudden 
      infant death syndrome (SIDS).5,6,7



      The MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System is an intrapartum fetal 
      monitor that externally measures and displays fetal heart rate (FHR), 
      maternal heart rate (MHR), and uterine contractions (UA). The MERIDIAN 
      M110 Fetal Monitoring System acquires and displays FHR, MHR and UA from 
      abdominal surface electrodes that detect the fetal ECG signals, maternal 
      ECG signals, and uterine muscle contraction signals. Tracings of FHR and 
      UA are displayed onto a primary fetal monitor.
    

      The MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System is indicated for use on women 
      who are at ≥ 37 completed weeks, in labor, with singleton pregnancies 
      using surface electrodes on the maternal abdomen. The MERIDIAN M110 
      Fetal Monitoring System is intended for use by healthcare professionals 
      in a clinical setting.
    

      Adam Wolfberg, M.D., Chief Medical Officer for MindChild stated, “The 
      ability of extract accurate fetal electrocardiographic information is a 
      tremendous achievement. As this technology enters the labor and delivery 
      clinic, new diagnostic capabilities will undoubtedly emerge, providing 
      insight into fetal management not currently available.” Dr. Wolfberg 
      continued, “In the coming months and years, MindChild will exploit this 
      technology to improve the safety of obstetrics, and hand a new 
      diagnostic device to obstetricians and pediatric cardiologists.”

MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System
MERIDIAN's patented technology is FDA cleared to take the place of not only Doppler and tocometry, but also fetal scalp electrode and the intrauterine pressure catheter. It is no longer necessary to weigh the advantage of invasive monitoring with the risk of infection: MERIDIAN M110 provides gold-standard signal without the risk of invasive monitoring. At a time when the average BMI of obstetric patients is rising, and clinical excellence demands reliable fetal heart rate and contraction signals from all patients, MERIDIAN M110 is the only fetal monitor on the market that performs as well in obese patients as it does in lean patients. Both the fetal heart rate signal and the contraction signal deteriorate when BMI increases, compromising obstetric safety. MERIDIAN M110 solves this problem with improved technology, raising the safety profile of your unit.

MERIDIAN M110 Disposable Electrode Patch
The MERIDIAN M110 Disposable Electrode Patch eliminates the need for skin preparation before use while providing outstanding performance and reliability across the full range of patient BMI anticipated during labor and delivery. The MERIDIAN M110 Disposable Electrode Patch replaces the fetal scalp electrode, intrauterine pressure catheter, Dopper, and TOCO sensors with a single non-invasive disposable system, while maintaining the same accuracy and sensitivity performance expected of today’s monitoring devices. Frequent repositioning associated with existing non-invasive monitoring is eliminated, as well as the risk of infection associated with invasive monitoring.
The MERIDIAN M110 Disposable Electrode Patch consists of four patches, two for the mother’s abdomen and one for each of her sides, which provides continuous fetal signal capture during fetal movement. With complete abdominal coverage, the Meridian M110 Disposable Electrode Patch delivers accurate and detailed fetal, maternal, and uterine monitoring, setting a new gold standard in fetal monitoring sensor technology.

MERIDIAN M110 Monitors the Fetal ECG
Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring has been widely used on adult patients for decades. In adults, signals representing a patient’s cardiac activities are collected through a set of skin surface electrodes distributed over the patient’s body.
Monitoring of fetal ECG (fECG) in this manner, however, can be difficult due to the co-existence of maternal and fetal signals acquired from a patient, as well as the relatively low fetal signal level relative to the maternal signal and other noise sources. MindChild has developed the MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System which is a device that utilizes external electrodes and a proprietary algorithm to discern between fetal and maternal signals allowing for an external, non-invasive device to calculate the fetal heart rate.
The MERIDIAN M110 FHR Sentinel Monitoring
The MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System overcomes a major safety hazard of traditional monitoring - the inability of Doppler technology to distinguish the maternal heart rate from the fetal heart rate when the mother and and the fetus's heart rates are similar. By tracking each signal independently, using a dedicated maternal ECG lead, MERIDIAN M110 FHR SentinelTM technology eliminates the risk.







MERIDIAN M110 Improves Quality of Interaction Between Nurse and Mother
The Meridian M110 eliminates the nursing time required to reposition the fetal monitoring transducer. The MERIDIAN M110 monitor eliminates transducer adjustment by automating sensor selection within the Meridian M110 Disposable Electrode Patch. In fact workflow analysis suggests that use of MERIDIAN M110 reduces nursing work by 1-2 hours per labor episode. This advantage is particularly pronounced when monitoring obese patients: fetal movement, maternal position, and adipose tissue conspire to make fetal monitoring a full-time job for the covering nurse. MERIDIAN M110 eliminates this hands-on work, freeing nursing staff to focus on more important aspects of patient care.





Competitive Advantages
Versus Established Technologies













Indications for Use
The MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System is an intrapartum fetal monitor that externally measures and displays fetal heart rate (FHR), maternal heart rate (MHR), and uterine contractions (UA). The MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System acquires and displays the FHR and UA from abdominal surface electrodes that detect the fetal ECG signals, maternal ECG signals, and of uterine muscle contraction signals. Tracings of FHR and UA are displayed onto a primary fetal monitor.
The MERIDIAN M110 Fetal Monitoring System is indicated for use on women who are at ≥ 37 completed weeks, in labor, with singleton pregnancies, using surface electrodes on the maternal abdomen. The MindChild MERIDIAN M110 is intended for use by health care professionals in a clinical setting.
