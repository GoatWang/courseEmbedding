Published on Mar 17, 2014BlackRock, the huge money management and investment firm,  recently came out with a retirement income product that somewhat resembles an annuity, yet gives consumers the ability to walk away like a traditional mutual fund (no long surrender charge like most annuities).This interesting new product's details (it is supposed to debut in the spring of 2014) were actually sent to us from a consumer who was wondering how this BlackRock retirement product will be different than a traditional annuity that could be purchased from an insurance carrier.  Although we don't have all of the fine details as this new CoRI Indexed product is not available yet, we did our best to give a completely Independent of review of the BlackRock CoRI retirement fund product vs the pros/cons of a traditional annuity.As you most already know, no retirement product we ever talk about is perfect for everyone, but this certainly has its place for the right consumer.  Moreover, we imagine because of BlackRock's strong name in the financial world, this CoRI retirement income product will fare quite well.  According to BlackRock's website:  The CoRI Retirement Index (CoRI Index) provides a daily "level" that can be used to calculate an estimate of how much annual income your current savings could generate as early as 10 years before retirement. Specifically, your CoRI Index level helps you determine an estimate of how much money you need today to generate each dollar of future, inflation-adjusted annual lifetime income starting at age 65.http://www.blackrock.com/cori/what-is...For more on Retirement Income and to download your FREE retirement articles on annuities, 401(k)'s, and Social Security, check out:http://www.retirethinktank.comThis review is completely independent as we are in no way affiliated or represent BlackRock or any of its companies or affiliates.  This independent BlackRock "CoRI" review cannot and should not be construed as investment advice and it is not enough to make an educated decision on your retirement.  We do advice that you speak to a qualified retirement income specialist before making any decision on any retirement income products.

BlackRock extends reach into retirement business with new funds, indexes
Money manager turns focus to retirement income, distribution vs. accumulation






Feb 12, 2014 @ 7:33 am
By 
	Darla Mercado























+ Zoom

BlackRock, led by CEO Larry Fink, is extending its push into the retirement business. (Bloomberg News)



BlackRock Inc. is pushing further into the retirement income sphere, this time launching a lineup of bond funds and indexes that try to measure the cost of lifetime income.	Back in July, the asset management juggernaut filed a lineup of bond funds with the Securities and Exchange Commission, dubbing this new product the BlackRock CoRI Funds. The bond funds primarily invest in corporate bonds, U.S. government bonds and Treasuries. 	The funds themselves, which opened for investing on Jan. 31, have maturity dates ranging from 2015 to 2023, and they're aimed at clients aged 55 to 64.
				



BlackRock also launched a series of indexes with corresponding maturity dates, which will track the changes over time to the expected median cost of lifetime income for a person turning 65 at the target year. The funds will aim to track the indexes.Investors and advisers can track the indexes on the New York Stock Exchange to determine how much estimated income the client will get from his or her retirement savings or the amount the client needs to save in order to reach a set amount of income. 	The initial launch of the indexes last summer, followed by the opening of the funds, are part of a greater strategy by BlackRock in which the company is putting more emphasis on life at and after retirement, as opposed to concentrating merely on accumulation. 	“We're seeing four stages in the investor lifecycle: accumulation up to age 65; pre-retirement — where you see the retirement horizon, but you still have enough time to correct course; early retirement; and late retirement. CoRI is critical in pre-retirement and early retirement.” said Chip Castille, head of BlackRock's defined-contribution business and U.S. retirement group	At the target date, investors have a couple of options. They can choose to stay in the fund, which will liquidate over the course of 10 years. They can also opt to liquidate their holdings and work with an adviser to move into a retirement income product, such as an annuity. 	The goal of the fund isn't to compete with the insurance industry, but rather to complement the many types of annuities that are already out there, Mr. Castille noted.	“You're getting ready for the annuity purchase; CoRI shows your ability to purchase lifetime income,” he said. Mr. Castille also said that for the first 10 years in retirement, investors can receive income payouts, get yields of 4% in today's rate environment and still maintain the ability to buy the annuity at some point in the future. As a bond fund and not an insurance product, CoRI has no guarantees. 	The development of the suite is the latest salvo from the asset management side on distributing retirement income, according to Geoff Bobroff, a mutual fund industry consultant. Life insurers have dominated that battle against asset managers due to carriers' ability to provide guaranteed income.	“The [asset management] industry continues to fuss with some kind of payout product, but nothing has really worked to attract the attention of the individual,” Mr. Bobroff said. “Without a guarantee and with the current level of interest rates, it's hard to see people committing the necessary level of assets to buy a stream of income.”

BlackRock Launches CoRI™ Funds






Business Wire




Feb 12, 2014 11:00 AM EST













 


















































  The CoRI Funds do not ensure that an investor will have sufficient assets to cover retirement expenses or that an investor will have enough saved to retire in the year identified in the CoRI Fund name. The CoRI Funds, the CoRI Retirement Indexes, their returns, and the value of an investment in the CoRI Funds, do not reflect the fees, expenses and cost that may be associated with an annuity or any other retirement income product that an individual may purchase, or any assumption that such a product will be available for purchase at the time of retirement.   The CoRI Funds may engage in active and frequent trading and may experience high portfolio turnover. The two main risks related to fixed income investing are interest rate risk and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. The CoRI Funds may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates due to the current period of historically low rates. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. The CoRI Funds may use derivatives to hedge investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.  The CoRI Retirement Indexes commenced ongoing calculation on June 28, 2013. The CoRI Retirement Indexes are maintained by BlackRock Index Services, LLC (the “Affiliated Index Provider”), a subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., that designs, sponsors and publishes indices for use in portfolio benchmarking and portfolio management. The Affiliated Index Provider is affiliated with, but a separate legal entity from, BlackRock Advisors, LLC, a subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. and the CoRI Funds’ investment adviser. BlackRock Advisors, LLC will have no role in maintaining the CoRI Retirement Indexes and will not be involved in, or have any control over, the calculation of the CoRI Retirement Index Levels or the construction of the CoRI Retirement Indexes’ securities portfolios.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
