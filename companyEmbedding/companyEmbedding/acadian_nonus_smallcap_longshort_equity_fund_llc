Home


Acadian specializes in active global and international equity strategies, employing sophisticated analytical models for active stock selection. Our proprietary database covers over 40,500 securities in more than 100 markets worldwide. Acadian's extensive research capabilities are used to develop customized investment management solutions for our clients.

 
















Acadian is led by a dedicated team including some employees whose tenure with the firm extends back over thirty years. Co-founder and CEO Churchill Franklin brought his experience from the corporate treasury and endowment worlds to his oversight of Acadian's client service, sales and marketing teams, and to his current role as Chief Executive Officer. CIO John Chisholm, whose long association with Acadian began while at MIT's Sloan School of Management, oversees our investment process and team and directs research initiatives. Ron Frashure, Chairman, continues to work closely with clients on asset allocation and investment policy issues. Ron was formerly a portfolio manager and director of asset allocation with the Putnam Companies prior to joining Acadian.



From its origin as a non-U.S. all-cap equity manager in 1988, Acadian has grown to manage over 60 different strategies in global equities and emerging markets for clients across the globe.  Acadian's strategies today include Global Equity, Long/Short Equity, and Managed Volatility along with a host of customized solutions which have been tailored to clients' needs. 
Acadian is proud to have been acknowledged by Pension & Investments as one of the Best Places to Work in Money Management for 2015. P&I noted many of Acadian's core beliefs of transparency, collaboration, and diversity in describing the characteristics that helped Acadian earn this distinction. In responding to surveys that were the basis for P&I's selections, Acadian employees took pride in mentioning Acadian's supportive culture and open, collegial atmosphere, also noting exciting opportunities for growth within the firm. According to the survey's data compilers, companies making P&I's "Best Places to Work" list scored highly in the categories of employer relations, social responsibility and diversity, and work-life balance. These firms also earned high marks from employees on career development, total rewards, and work environment.
