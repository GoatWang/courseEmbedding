Item 3. Source or Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.  
 
As

Description
of transaction resulting in a change of control.
 
On
November 14, 2016, 2538093 Ontario Inc. (“Ontario”) acquired in a stock for stock exchange with 8464081 Canada Inc.
(“Canada”) 200,528,362 shares of common stock of BlastGard and warrants to purchase 41,801,793 additional shares of
common stock of BlastGard at an exercise price of $.009 per share. After the completion of this transaction, Ontario will have
the beneficial ownership interest in 242,330,155 shares of common stock of BlastGard, representing 59.3% of the outstanding shares
of BlastGard. Accordingly, at the completion of the transaction, Canada has transferred 100% of its ownership interest in BlastGard
to Ontario. Canada, which is controlled by Barbara J. Amiel, will continue to have 50% of the voting rights of Ontario, whose
other principal owner is an entity controlled by Craig Campbell, a former director of BlastGard and the President and owner of
our newly engaged consultant, Resilience Capital Inc. Craig Campbell has an indirect ownership of 40%, and the right to exercise
the remaining 50% of the voting rights, of Ontario. Paul Sparkes, Chairman of BlastGard, has an indirect minority interest (i.e.
10%) of Ontario through a 20% ownership interest in the entity owned by Mr. Campbell.
 
Prior
to the change in control described herein, Canada, by agreement with BlastGard, which rights have been assigned to Ontario, has
the right to appoint a majority of the directors of BlastGard and right of first refusal to participate in future financings.
Currently, three of the existing seven directors of BlastGard were appointed by Canada. Contemporaneous with the reporting person’s
acquisition of control of the Registrant, an affiliated entity, Resilience Capital Inc. entered into a consulting agreement with
the Registrant pursuant to which it will receive consulting fees with an annual fee of $250,000. This entity is owned by Craig
Campbell, the president and principal owner of Resilience.

Acquires Drive Products Income FundMarketwireNovember 15, 2010ReblogShareTweetShareTORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwire - Nov. 15, 2010) - Drive Products Income Fund (the "Fund") (TSX:DPI.UN - News) and 2256479 Ontario Inc. (the "Offeror"), a company controlled by Greg Edmonds, Chief Executive Officer of the Fund and Russell Bilyk, President of Drive Products, the operating partnership owned by the Fund (together, the "Insiders"), announced today that 5,172,828 trust units (the "Units") of the Fund have been validly deposited under the Offeror's previously announced offer to purchase (the "Offer") at a price of $2.50 cash per Unit all of the issued and outstanding Units, other than Units owned and/or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Offeror, its affiliates, the Insiders and certain excluded parties (the "Excluded Parties"). The Offeror has taken up and accepted for payment all of the Units validly deposited under the Offer, representing approximately 75.1% of the outstanding Units. Payment is expected to be made to holders of Units who have validly deposited their Units under the Offer on November 15, 2010.Upon taking up and paying for the Units validly deposited under the Offer, the Offeror, together with its affiliates, the Insiders and the Excluded Parties, will own an aggregate of 6,046,928 Units and 6,360,418 Class B limited partnership units of Drive Products Limited Partnership, representing approximately 87.8% of the outstanding Units and 93.6% of the Fund's outstanding voting units. The Offeror intends to amend the Fund's declaration of trust, as described in the take-over bid circular mailed in connection with the Offer, to permit the purchase by the Offeror of all Units not deposited under the Offer immediately on giving notice to registered holders of Units. The Offeror expects to deliver a formal notice of compulsory acquisition to all registered holders of Units on or about November 15, 2010. Upon delivery of such notice, all outstanding Units will be deemed to have been acquired by the Offeror on the same terms as the Units acquired under the Offer. The Offeror expects to deliver payment of the $2.50 cash per Unit consideration to the depositary under the Offer on or about November 15, 2010 to be forwarded to all holders of Units.Following the completion of the above transactions, the Units will cease to be listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Offeror also intends to cause the Fund to file with the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities the necessary documentation to cease to be a reporting issuer in all of the jurisdictions in which it is currently a reporting issuer.About Drive Products Income FundDrive Products Income Fund holds a 52% indirect interest in Drive Products.

Forward-looking statements include all statements that are predictive in nature or that depend on future events or conditions. Forward-looking information is typically identified by words such as "may", "will", "intend", "should", "expect", "believe", "plan", "anticipate", "estimate", "predict", "potential", "continue" or the negative of these terms or other similar terminology. All statements in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Specifically, this press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the expected date for payment of all of the Units validly deposited under the Offer and all of the Units acquired pursuant to the compulsory acquisition, the delisting of the Units from the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the Fund ceasing to be a reporting issuer. Forward-looking information should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results. Investors should not rely unduly on forward-looking information as a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking information. Although the forward-looking information contained in this press release is based upon what management believes are reasonable assumptions, neither the Fund, Gregory Edmonds, Russell Bilyk nor the Offeror can assure investors that actual results will be consistent with results anticipated in such forward-looking information.The forward-looking information is provided as of the date of this press release and none of the Fund, Gregory Edmonds, Russell Bilyk nor the Offeror assumes any obligation to update or revise the forward-looking information to reflect new events or circumstances except as required by applicable law.ReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityJustin Bieber Cancels All Remaining 'Purpose' Tour Dates Due to 'Unforeseen Circumstances'2,180 reactions4%78%18%Start Earning Miles With The Best Travel CardWise BreadSponsoredDrawing in the customers in Mogadishu44 reactions8%80%12%Here's Trump's approval rating in every state2,345 reactions5%69%26%New York kayak murder case: Woman pleads guilty to negligent homicide in fiance death888 reactions3%74%23%Dog Gets On Bus Alone Every Day Without OwnerNews Daily FeedSponsoredTwo-time Pulitzer Prize winning photographer Muhammed Muheisen36 reactions2%83%15%Channing Tatum surprised fans in LA with vodkaLuis Fonsi On Justin Bieber's Spanish, 'Despacito' Hitting No. 1505 reactions3%80%17%How To Cash In Big On The Bitcoin Craze By July 28Agora FinancialSponsoredHouston Stripper Maliah Michel Responds to Drake 'Retiring' Her Jersey937 reactions6%76%18%Marine’s Son Weeps in Stepmom’s Arms at Wedding: ‘He Could Feel All of the Emotions in the Room and All of the Love’312 reactions16%65%19%Yazidi girl held captive by Isis reveals she was raped every day for six months4,391 reactions5%62%33%People in Heavy Debt May Be in For a Big SurpriseFreedom Debt ReliefSponsoredBodies found in overheated truck in a Walmart in Texas995 reactions4%75%21%How Cyndi Lauper helped Panic!'s Brendon Urie star in 'Kinky Boots'Kushner returns to Capitol Hill for 2nd day of interviewsBarry: Trump and his extended family have had a habit of perjuring themselves, at worst, and insulting the intelligence of at least those of us who feel the need to question their motives, at best.

	Description
	of transaction resulting in a change of control.





	 




	On
	November 14, 2016, 2538093 Ontario Inc. (“Ontario”) acquired in a stock for stock exchange with 8464081 Canada Inc.
	(“Canada”) 200,528,362 shares of common stock of BlastGard and warrants to purchase 41,801,793 additional shares of
	common stock of BlastGard at an exercise price of $.009 per share. After the completion of this transaction, Ontario will have
	the beneficial ownership interest in 242,330,155 shares of common stock of BlastGard, representing 59.3% of the outstanding shares
	of BlastGard. Accordingly, at the completion of the transaction, Canada has transferred 100% of its ownership interest in BlastGard
	to Ontario. Canada, which is controlled by Barbara J. Amiel, will continue to have 50% of the voting rights of Ontario, whose
	other principal owner is an entity controlled by Craig Campbell, a former director of BlastGard and the President and owner of
	our newly engaged consultant, Resilience Capital Inc. Craig Campbell has an indirect ownership of 40%, and the right to exercise
	the remaining 50% of the voting rights, of Ontario. Paul Sparkes, Chairman of BlastGard, has an indirect minority interest (i.e.
	10%) of Ontario through a 20% ownership interest in the entity owned by Mr. Campbell.



	 



	Prior
	to the change in control described herein, Canada, by agreement with BlastGard, which rights have been assigned to Ontario, has
	the right to appoint a majority of the directors of BlastGard and right of first refusal to participate in future financings.
	Currently, three of the existing seven directors of BlastGard were appointed by Canada. Contemporaneous with the reporting person’s
	acquisition of control of the Registrant, an affiliated entity, Resilience Capital Inc. entered into a consulting agreement with
	the Registrant pursuant to which it will receive consulting fees with an annual fee of $250,000. This entity is owned by Craig
	Campbell, the president and principal owner of Resilience.

Item 5.01
Changes in Control of Registrant.

 

On
November 14, 2016, 2538093 Ontario Inc. (“Ontario”)
acquired in a stock for stock exchange with 8464081 Canada Inc.
(“Canada”) 200,528,362 shares of common stock of
BlastGard and warrants to purchase 41,801,793 additional shares of
common stock of BlastGard at an exercise price of $.009 per share.
After the completion of this transaction, Ontario will have the
beneficial ownership interest in 242,330,155 shares of common stock
of BlastGard, representing 59.3% of the outstanding shares of
BlastGard. Accordingly, at the completion of the transaction,
Canada has transferred 100% of its ownership interest in BlastGard
to Ontario. Canada, which is controlled by Barbara J. Amiel, will
continue to have 50% of the voting rights of Ontario, whose other
principal owner is an entity controlled by Craig Campbell, a former
director of BlastGard and the President and owner of our newly
engaged consultant, Resilience Capital Inc. Craig Campbell has an
indirect ownership of 40%, and the right to exercise the remaining
50% of the voting rights, of Ontario. Paul Sparkes, Chairman of
BlastGard, has an indirect minority interest (i.e. 10%) of Ontario
through a 20% ownership interest in the entity owned by Mr.
Campbell.

 

Other than
the foregoing change in control, BlastGard is not aware of any
agreements or understandings which may result in any further change
in control of BlastGard. Prior to the change in control described
herein, Canada, by agreement with BlastGard, which rights have been
assigned to Ontario, has the right to appoint a majority of the
directors of BlastGard and right of first refusal to participate in
future financings. Currently, three of the existing seven directors
of BlastGard were appointed by Canada.
