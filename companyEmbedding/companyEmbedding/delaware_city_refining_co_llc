PBF Energy (“PBF”) is one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and suppliers of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants and other petroleum products in the United States. PBF currently owns and operates five domestic oil refineries and related assets with a combined processing capacity, known as throughput, of approximately 900,000 bpd, and a weighted average Nelson Complexity Index of 12.2.
PBF Energy’s refineries are located in California, Delaware, Louisiana, New Jersey and Ohio. Our newest refinery is located in Torrance, California processes a blend of primarily heavy and medium crudes to produce a high-value product slate.  The Torrance refinery has a nameplate crude capacity of 155,000 barrels per day and is PBF’s most complex refinery with a Nelson Complexity index of 14.9.  The Chalmette refinery was acquired by PBF Energy in 2015 and is located just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. Chalmette is a 189,000 barrel per day, dual-train coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity of 12.7 and is capable of processing both light and heavy crude oil. The facility is strategically positioned on the Gulf Coast with strong logistics connectivity that offers flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities, including the potential to export products.  Our East Coast refineries, at Delaware City and Paulsboro, have a combined refining capacity of 370,000 bpd and Nelson Complexity Indices of 11.3 and 13.2, respectively. These high-conversion refineries process primarily medium and heavy, sour crudes and have historically received the bulk of their feedstock via ships and barges on the Delaware River but have the capability to receive crude shipments via rail into crude rail unloading facilities at our Delaware City refinery.  Our Midcontinent refinery, at Toledo, processes light, sweet crude, has a throughput capacity of 170,000 bpd and a Nelson Complexity Index of 9.2. The majority of Toledo’s WTI-based crude is delivered via pipelines that originate in both Canada and the United States. Since our acquisition of Toledo in 2011, we have added additional truck and rail crude unloading capabilities that provide feedstock sourcing flexibility for the refinery and enables Toledo to run a more cost-advantaged crude slate.
PBF Energy also owns 49.5% of PBF Logistics LP (NYSE: PBFX). PBF Logistics LP, headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, is a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by PBF Energy to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products, terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets.
