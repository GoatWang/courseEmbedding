The U.S. International Trade Commission refused to rescind its May 4 ruling that found Arista's switches infringed two Cisco patents and banned Arista from importing the infringing products into the United States. After the ITC released that decision, a different agency, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, said the two Cisco patents are invalid.  Arista urged the ITC to rescind its import ban, saying it would be unfair because the Patent Office invalidated Cisco's patents. But the ITC said in Thursday's decision that the Patent Office rulings "do not constitute a changed circumstance such that the remedial orders should be rescinded." Marc Taxay, senior vice president and general counsel of  Santa Clara, California-based Arista, said in a statement on Thursday that the company was "deeply disappointed" in the ruling, which he called a departure from established law.  Taxay said Arista will appeal the ruling and will also be releasing modified products to maintain the supply of its products in compliance with the ITC's decision. Cisco said in a statement on Thursday that the ITC sent a strong message that Arista's "corporate culture of copying," as it said the ITC described it, must stop.  San Jose, California-based Cisco and Arista are fierce competitors in the multibillion-dollar market for ethernet switches that connect computers and servers. Cisco brought multiple lawsuits against Arista in 2014, alleging it brazenly copied Cisco's intellectual property. Arista, which was formed by former Cisco employees, has denied the allegations and accused Cisco of a smear campaign and trying to stifle competition. The ITC ruled last year in a separate lawsuit that Arista infringed Cisco patents relating to managing and securing communications networks. Arista redesigned its switches, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in April that the company could resume importing its redesigned products.

Arista had asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to review the validity of a patent it granted to Cisco relating to network device security. The Patent Office sided with Arista on Thursday, invalidating key claims in the patent.  A week earlier, the Patent Office invalidated claims in a different Cisco patent on a way to improve processing in network devices.   San Jose, California-based Cisco and Arista are fierce competitors in the multibillion-dollar market for ethernet switches that connect computers and servers.  Last month, the U.S. International Trade Commission concluded that Arista's switches had infringed the Cisco patents and said it would issue an order banning Arista from importing the infringing products into the United States.  FILE PHOTO -  The Cisco Systems logo is seen as part of a display at the Microsoft Ignite technology conference in Chicago, Illinois, May 4, 2015.Jim Young/File PhotoArista general counsel Marc Taxay said on Thursday that the company "will now seek complete suspension" of the ITC's import ban, which is slated to go into effect in July.  Cisco did not immediately return a request for comment.  Thursday's ruling is the latest development in a years-long legal battle between Cisco and Arista. Cisco brought multiple lawsuits against Arista in 2014, alleging it has a "culture of copying" Cisco's intellectual property. Arista has denied the allegations and accused Cisco of a smear campaign.  The ITC ruled last year that Arista had infringed three other Cisco patents relating to managing and securing communications networks. Arista redesigned its switches, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in April that the company could resume importing its redesigned products.  Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Arista closed at $148.52 on Thursday, up 0.7 percent, after dropping below $145 a share earlier in the day. Cisco shares ended the day 0.9 percent higher at $31.82.

Cisco, Arista Trade Barbs After US Product Import Ban Upheld

Pages12next ›last »The contentious legal battle between networking rivals Cisco and Arista Networks continues to rage on as the International Trade Commission (ITC) Thursday upheld its decision to ban the importation and sale of some of Arista's networking products into the United States.
Shares of Arista stock traded down more than 3 percent at $151.81 Friday afternoon after the ITC denied the vendor's request to lift the ban.
Cisco Senior Vice President, General Counsel Mark Chandler said the ITC send "a strong message to Arista that its corporate culture of copying" must stop.
[Related: Here's Who Made Gartner's 2017 Magic Quadrant For Data Center Networking]
"We have had one goal: for Arista to stop selling products using Cisco’s intellectual property," said Chandler, in a blog post on Friday. "Arista has used every stratagem to delay the case and avoid taking that step … We hope Arista’s board will now stand up and demand that the company cease use of all misappropriated technology."
Arista had sought via an emergency petition to overturn the ITC's May 4 ruling that banned the import of Arista switches found to infringe on Cisco patents. The emergency petition came after a ruling from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) found the relevant Cisco's patents to be invalid. 
In its ruling Thursday, the ITC said it denied Arista's petition because the USPTO appeal process has not yet been exhausted and is therefore not final. 
"Despite Cisco's overheated rhetoric and promises to shut Arista down, we are still standing tall thanks to the wide-ranging support we have received from the larger community that sees this assault for what it is," said Arista in a statement to investors on Thursday.
The dispute dates back to December, 2014, when Cisco filed several lawsuits against Arista alleging the vendor infringed on multiple Cisco patents. 
Arista is deeply disappointed" in the ITC's decision to enforce "patent claims that the USPTO has clearly found to be invalid," said Arista Senior Vice President and General Counsel Marc Taxay in an email to CRN.
Arista has already been creating new versions of products, such as its flagship EOS software, that have patent infringement workarounds.

Arista gets important win over Cisco in patent battle





Cisco says Arista’s redesign moves not good enough





Cisco calls on Arista to stop selling products in US after agency reverses...






Video
What is software-defined networking (SDN)?






















The legal ping-pong battle between Cisco and Arista Thursday found Cisco on the winning side as In the International Trade Commission ruled that Arista switches infringe on two core Cisco patents that the company says are key technologies in its network switching pantheon.+More on Network World: Arista gets important win over Cisco in patent battle+Mark Chandler, senior vice president, General Counsel and Secretary of Cisco wrote in a blog post of the Commission’s specific ruling that Arista was:
In violation of U.S. Patent 6,377,577 (“Access Control List Processing In Hardware”)
In violation of U.S. Patent 7,224,668 (“Control Plane Security and Traffic Flow Management”)
“Both of these patents cover core Cisco networking technology. The ‘577 patent, a named inventor of which is Arista chairman and founder, Andy Bechtolsheim, who presumably was aware of his own invention when designing Arista products, is a fundamental Cisco invention that improves processing in network devices,” Chandler said. “The ‘668 patent covers a core Cisco invention for improving network device security and helps, among other things, prevent denial of service attacks. Like our other patents that Arista was found to infringe, these inventions were developed by Cisco employees and remain critical to the cutting-edge products that we sell.” Chandler wrote that “by confirming Administrative Law Judge McNamara’s Initial Determination, the Commission brings the total confirmed Arista patent violations to five. Today’s ruling in the “945 Investigation” concludes Commission review of the two cases brought by Cisco in December 2014,” Chandler stated. “The Commission’s decision is the latest of several findings that Arista has intentionally and unlawfully copied Cisco’s proprietary technology.  As the Commission put it in its less-redacted version of the‘944 ruling, which was made public only two weeks ago, “Arista’s behavior evinces a corporate culture of copying,” and finding that at best, Arista was “willfully blind” to Cisco’s intellectual property. It is this culture of copying that Cisco has aimed at in its legal action.”+More on Network World: Extreme offers glimpse of integrated Avaya, Brocade technology future+Today’s ITC ruling also included a recommended remedy, which consists of an import ban and a cease and desist order, and that Arista pay a 5% bond on covered products sold or imported during a prescribed presidential review period. These affect all Arista switches. The burden is on Arista to demonstrate that any changes it makes to its products will be sufficient to avoid further infringement, Chandler stated.   “Now begins the 60-day presidential review period for this case, which expires on July 4, 2017. At that time, barring a very unlikely intervention from the U.S. Trade Representative on behalf of the President, the new ITC orders will go into effect – banning the import, sale and distribution of Arista products in the U.S.”Firing back, Marc Taxay, Arista vice president and general counsel said in a statement to Network World:"We believe that Cisco's litigation is part of a broader effort to preserve its market position at the expense of competition and innovation. Cisco's motives are revealed through its assertion of the '577 patent against a 20-year old technology that is embedded in standard chips we buy off the shelf from vendors like many others in our industry including Cisco. Cisco has never asserted these patents against any other network switch vendor or third party chip supplier. And, given that it filed its patent application for this technology in 1998, and the patent expires in June 2018, Cisco has had ample years to do so.” The ruling was referred to during Arista’s Q1 2017 earnings announcement.In response to an analyst’s question about the findings, Taxay stated: “There are two IPRs [Inter partes review -- a procedure for challenging the validity of a United States patent before the United States Patent and Trademark Office ] that have been instituted on the '668 and the '577 patents, which were the patents that were found to have been infringed in the 945. There were hearings that were held at the PTAB [Patent Trial and Appeal Board] in March, and the final decisions by the PTAB will be issued by June 11. So from a timing standpoint, as you probably know, there's a 60-day review period – presidential review period following the issuance of the final determination of the ITC. So that should come out to July 3, so the PTAB decisions will come out several weeks before that,” Taxay stated [A full transcript of the Arista call is available on the Seeking Alpha site here].“At this stage, obviously, we've been evaluating our design-around strategy. We are obviously preparing that strategy in the event that we were to lose the IPRs. And as I said, we just received the final determination, so we have to go through the actual written opinion to see how that flows through. But certainly, our plan would be based upon our review of that. We have several different options that we're evaluating, and we'll have something together before the end of presidential review period,” Taxay stated.The current ruling adds yet another twist to the ongoing patent and copyright infringement case between Cisco and Arista. In April Arista landed a significant win that let it once again import redesigned products to the US that have been under import embargo since January, the so-called ‘944 case.Specifically, according to a post on Arista’s site, on “April 7, 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) completed its review and once again ruled that Arista’s redesigned products do not infringe the ’592, ’145, or ’537 patents that were the subject of a limited exclusion order and cease and desist order issued by the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) in Investigation No. 337-TA-944 and that Arista may resume importing its redesigned products into the United States.”The action surrounds a claim that Arista made that the software that runs its switching products --Extensible Operating System 4.16 and later-- had been sufficiently redesigned to work around Cisco’s infringement claims.The April 7 ruling follows the January 15, 2017 decision by CBP to revoke its November 18, 2016 ruling that our redesigned products do not infringe the ’145, ’592, and’537 patents. That revocation lead to those products being held back from import into the US. That ruling said current products which contain its redesigned EOS are not within the scope of the limited exclusion order and it could begin selling its product in the U.S. again.
