Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

North Carolina Farm Bureau Insurance Group


                                            I highly recommend Farm Bureau Insurance. Nathan Ray cares about his clients.

Electro Savings Credit Union


                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

An African-American pioneer in the field of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning, Crosthwait attended Purdue University, where he studied mechanical engineering. After graduating in 1913, he took a job with the C.A. Dunham Company (now known as Dunham-Bush, Inc.).Heating and Cooling InventionsDuring his time with the C.A. Dunham Company, David Crosthwait held many positions,  including director of research. While at Dunham, he conducted research  in several areas, including heat transfer and steam transport. His work  led to many innovations in HVAC devices and technology, and he held more  than 30 U.S. patents.

David Sheraton
President and CEO at R&D Medical Products
 



After graduating from the University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences, studying medicine and Italian in Florence, Italy, David was Director of Research and Development and Quality Assurance Manager for Sentry Medical Products, Inc. with his primary responsibilities being the development of medical electrodes and overseeing the quality system. His contribution to development work of medical electrodes provided Sentry Medical with the opportunity to grow at a near exponential rate and become a world leader in the neonatal ECG electrode market until it was acquired by Tyco in 1996.
After Sentry Medical was acquired by Tyco, several of the clients he had developed products for at Sentry Medical encouraged him to start his own company and provide him with the start-up capital. From this investment, David incorporated R&D Medical Products on June 4, 1997 establishing itself as a Contract Medical Device Manufacturer.
His leadership at R&D Medical during the past sixteen years has created a strong manufacturing base in Orange County California. His client driven philosophy and long range product development goals has produce a successful “Made in America” medical device manufacturing company which has been listed in the Orange County Business Journal as one of the fastest growing companies in 3 of the last 4 years.
Maintaining R&D Medical’s status of a “Made in the USA” company has been his primary objective. Nevertheless, on the international scale David has broadened his language skills to include French in recent years in order to broaden his client base in Europe and the Middle East. To support these efforts, David serves on the Executive Board of World Affairs Council of Orange County.
Through his recent international endeavors, R&D Medical is now exporting its US made products to over 200 countries.
