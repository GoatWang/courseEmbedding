We here at the Philly.com newsroom live and breathe a lifestyle of coffee. It’s the thing that wakes our senses in the morning and keeps us alert all day. So when we received a box in the mail from Philadelphia-based company Zest Tea, a product which claims to be the most caffeinated tea on the market, we were intrigued and skeptical.



Zest is a product that promises the same caffeine punch as a cup of coffee – that’s three times the amount of normal teas. The level of caffeine in each of the four varieties varies depending on what you choose. The Earl Grey Black, Apple Cinnamon Black, and Blue Lady Black all have 150 mg/cup while the milder Pomegranate Mojito Green has about 140 mg/cup.


For three days, five of us volunteered to replace our coffee with Zest Tea. Each day we kept a brief diary of our experience: which flavor we had (we tried all but Apple Cinnamon), how many times we loaded up with a new bag, and our general thoughts on the drink versus our beloved coffee. 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS
Each variety of Zest comes in a lightweight cylindrical canister with 20 individual packets. The teabags themselves are really beautiful. The loose leaves come in a biodegradable pyramid satchel that allows you to see vibrant colors of the ingredients, especially in the Blue Lady. The company sources ingredients from the Nilgiri region of India and the Anhui province of China, so you can really smell and see the quality.



 


We unanimously agreed that the smell of this tea is powerful and pleasant, even before we put it in hot water. So far, so good. 
STEEP & SIP



The aroma of a hot brewed cup left a nice lingering fragrance around our desks. The Pomegranate Mojito Green had the most enjoyable sent.   
While the smell was overall favorable, many thought the flavor was a bit much. “The tea is strong and the flavor is too overpowering if the bag is left in the cup for too long,” said staff photographer Steph Aaronson. “There is also no string to pull the bag out so having a spoon handy is necessary.” Zest recommends that your tea steeps for 4-6 minutes.
What many of us noticed, including myself, is that less than 30 minutes after having several sips from our cup, we felt “in the zone” almost more clearheaded than we would normally be with coffee by our side.
Staff writer Nick Vadala admitted to drinking at least 8-9 cups of coffee on a daily basis. With Zest, he cut down to 3-4 cups of tea, which proved to him that it matched, if not exceeded, the caffeine content in a cup of coffee. “It definitely hits you harder, but I didn't get jittery or anything,” he said. “The real benefits are that you drink less so therefore less calories are taken in, and the tea feels like it's a little easier on your stomach than coffee can be.” 



  

It was quite the opposite for staff photographer Colin Kerrigan, who had an average of 1-2 cups of coffee a day. He said that Zest’s high levels of caffeine left him with “a weird head high” and recommends not drinking it on an empty stomach. “Tea is nice to have in certain situations but it's just not my morning coffee,” he said.
I, like Colin, drink about 1-2 cups of coffee everyday so I experienced that same head high during the morning hours of day one. In succeeding days I lost that jittery feeling but retained the alertness and clarity. Contrary to Colin’s feedback, I drank the tea on an empty stomach and it was actually very soothing in my belly.
CONCLUSION
While we all really enjoyed the flavors and smells of the tea, after day one we couldn’t help but yearn for our old friend coffee, but that doesn’t mean we had abandoned the idea of tea.
Both Steph and executive entertainment producer Leah Kauffman replaced their afternoon coffee with Zest and said it “provided a flavorful pick-me-up” and found that it actually stopped their cravings for coffee.
WORTH IT?


Zest Tea costs about $11-13 depending on your chosen flavor. Each cylinder comes with 20 satchels of loose tea leaves (which we think you can salvage at least two cups out of, depending on your boldness preference). We think regular and occasional tea drinkers will really enjoy this brand. But if you're a dedicated coffee drinker, don't expect to be wooed by this product. You can't pick it up in stores just yet, but you can order online.

Zest High Caffeine Teas

















Amino Acids


Natural Caffeine


Steady Alertness




L-Theanine is a rare amino acid found in Zest Tea that helps increase cognitive function, enhance mood, and improve memory. 


Zest Tea's all-natural caffeine increases energy, alertness, and stamina. Caffeine has also been shown to ward off a variety of diseases.


The L-Theanine and Caffeine in Zest Tea fuse for a steady and prolonged alertness, without the jitters & crash.






 
Zest Tea is a line of high caffeine energy boosting teas. Zest’s premium tea blends have comparable caffeine levels to coffee, for an energizing kick, and amino acids shown reduce the jitters and crash while boosting cognitive functions. The result is a steady and prolonged alertness.
 




Zest Tea Caffeine Levels




Zest Black Tea



155mg / cup


Zest tea has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee, or about 3x the levels of normal teas. We use a proprietary blending process and natural caffeine extract to enhance the caffeine levels of our teas. This makes Zest the tea with the highest caffeine on the market!
Our biggest concern when developing these teas was maintaining the delicious flavor profiles of our base teas. If you look at our reviews you'll see that we accomplished this task. Our teas are applauded as much for their premium flavors as they are the enhanced energy levels!




Zest Green Tea



135 mg / cup




Coffee



125 mg / cup




Traditional Black Tea



50 mg / cup




Traditional Green Tea



25 mg / cup




 
"We felt 'in the zone' almost more clearheaded than we would normally be with coffee... It definitely hits you harder, but I didn't get jittery or anything"
- Philly.com 
 




Focused Energy




The combination of the caffeine and L-Theanine (a rare amino acid) in Zest Tea has a synergistic effect that prolongs the energy levels and creates a more steady alertness. A side effect of the energy moderation is a reduction in the "jitters" and "crash" that typically accompanies caffeinated beverages.  





  





"Tastes great and good energy. Have literally stopped drinking coffee since getting my first batch of zest tea!!"
Billy Schrero





"Perks me up 10x better than coffee, amazing!" 
Daniel Rodic





"I know the selling point of Zest Teas are the caffeine, but honestly the flavor is what keeps me coming back. I have never had such a flavorful tea that was not overpowering. This stuff is awesome."
 Nick Loadholtes


"I love coffee but from having my first cup of Zest Tea all I can say is WOW."
Daniel Becker

Company Summary





Winner of Best New Product at the World Tea Expo, Zest energy teas offer the energizing kick of coffee without the negative side effects. Despite our teas having comparable caffeine levels to coffee, the amino acids in Zest produce a steady and prolonged alertness, instead of the jitters and crash often associated with caffeinated products.
Zest has sold online since 2014 and launched into retail (Harris Teeter, Wegmans, Whole Foods) in 2016.

Without The Jitters Or Crash Of Coffee



 


Focused Energy
The combination of the caffeine and L-Theanine (a rare amino acid) in Zest Tea has a synergistic effect that prolongs the energy levels and creates a more steady alertness. A side effect of the energy moderation is a reduction in the "jitters" and "crash" that typically accompanies caffeinated beverages. 













A healthy and effective coffee substitute
"We felt 'in the zone' almost more clearheaded than we would normally be with coffee... It definitely hits you harder, but I didn't get jittery or anything" - Philly.com













ZestTeamonials
 





"Tastes great and good energy. Have literally stopped drinking coffee since getting my first batch of zest tea!!"
Billy Schrero






"Perks me up 10x better than coffee, amazing!" 
Daniel Rodic





"I know the selling point of Zest Teas are the caffeine, but honestly the flavor is what keeps me coming back. I have never had such a flavorful tea that was not overpowering. This stuff is awesome."
Nick Loadholtes



"I love coffee but from having my first cup of Zest Tea all I can say is WOW."
Daniel Becker

Zest Tea, LLC


        Winner of Best New Product at the 2015 World Tea Expo, Zest brings innovation to an industry steeped in tradition. Most new developments in the tea industry have related to the tea bags, but Zest brings new and exciting features to the tea itself with their high caffeine blends. Furthermore, half of our customers identify as tea drinkers and the other half as former coffee drinkers. Zest is pulling new customers into the tea market.
    

From the 63rd Summer Fancy Food Show 2017
                 (booth 5119)
            

Winner of the Best New Product at the 2015 World Tea Expo, Zest premium energy teas offer the same energizing kick of coffee without the negative side effects. Despite our teas having comparable caffeine levels to coffee—about three times the levels of traditional teas—the amino acids in Zest help create a steady and prolonged alertness, instead of the jitters and crash associated with other caffeinated products.

Without The Jitters Or Crash Of Coffee



 


Focused Energy
The combination of the caffeine and L-Theanine (a rare amino acid) in Zest Tea has a synergistic effect that prolongs the energy levels and creates a more steady alertness. A side effect of the energy moderation is a reduction in the "jitters" and "crash" that typically accompanies caffeinated beverages. 













A healthy and effective coffee substitute
"We felt 'in the zone' almost more clearheaded than we would normally be with coffee... It definitely hits you harder, but I didn't get jittery or anything" - Philly.com













ZestTeamonials
 





"Tastes great and good energy. Have literally stopped drinking coffee since getting my first batch of zest tea!!"
Billy Schrero






"Perks me up 10x better than coffee, amazing!" 
Daniel Rodic





"I know the selling point of Zest Teas are the caffeine, but honestly the flavor is what keeps me coming back. I have never had such a flavorful tea that was not overpowering. This stuff is awesome."
Nick Loadholtes



"I love coffee but from having my first cup of Zest Tea all I can say is WOW."
Daniel Becker

Zest Tea is a line of premium energy teas with the same energizing kick of coffee. While our teas have comparable caffeine levels to coffee—about three times the levels of traditional teas—the amino acids in Zest help reduce the jitters and crash associated with most caffeinated products, resulting in a steady and prolonged alertness.
The four flavors are:
Cinnamon Apple Black Tea: Our lusty Indian Nigiri Black tea marries a scrumptious blend of apple and cinnamon flavors, graciously speckled with apple pieces and cinnamon chips to deliver a plush cupped dessert. The Cinnamon and Apple meld together for a uniquely American flavored black tea!
Blue Lady Black Tea: As the name implies, this is a mysterious tea with a blend of soft floral notes of hibiscus and a tropical tango of lemon, orange and passionfruit.
Earl Grey Black Tea: A remarkable blend of Nilgiri black Indian teas flavored with the citrus oil, bergamot. The tea is named for Charles Grey, the 2nd Earl of Grey, who made it famous in the 1830s. This extremely popular blend is the perfect afternoon tea. Best served in the traditional fashion, hot with milk and sugar.

Pomegranate Mojito Green Tea: A unique spin off of the Cuban Mojito, a drink traditionally featuring the zesty flavors of mint and lime. Pomegranate gently compliments these predominate flavors against a smooth and delicate green tea base. This tranquil blend is perfect for a summer afternoon, and is delicious both hot and iced.


Caffeine: Approximately 150 mg/ cup - About the same as a cup of coffee!

Zest Tea, LLC


        Winner of Best New Product at the 2015 World Tea Expo, Zest brings innovation to an industry steeped in tradition. Most new developments in the tea industry have related to the tea bags, but Zest brings new and exciting features to the tea itself with their high caffeine blends. Furthermore, half of our customers identify as tea drinkers and the other half as former coffee drinkers. Zest is pulling new customers into the tea market.
    

From the 63rd Summer Fancy Food Show 2017
                 (booth 5119)
            

Winner of the Best New Product at the 2015 World Tea Expo, Zest premium energy teas offer the same energizing kick of coffee without the negative side effects. Despite our teas having comparable caffeine levels to coffee—about three times the levels of traditional teas—the amino acids in Zest help create a steady and prolonged alertness, instead of the jitters and crash associated with other caffeinated products.

Zest Tea is a line of premium energy teas with the same energizing kick of coffee. While our teas have comparable caffeine levels to coffee—about three times the levels of traditional teas—the amino acids in Zest help reduce the jitters and crash associated with most caffeinated products, resulting in a steady and prolonged alertness.
The four flavors are:
Cinnamon Apple Black Tea: Our lusty Indian Nigiri Black tea marries a scrumptious blend of apple and cinnamon flavors, graciously speckled with apple pieces and cinnamon chips to deliver a plush cupped dessert. The Cinnamon and Apple meld together for a uniquely American flavored black tea!
Blue Lady Black Tea: As the name implies, this is a mysterious tea with a blend of soft floral notes of hibiscus and a tropical tango of lemon, orange and passionfruit.
Earl Grey Black Tea: A remarkable blend of Nilgiri black Indian teas flavored with the citrus oil, bergamot. The tea is named for Charles Grey, the 2nd Earl of Grey, who made it famous in the 1830s. This extremely popular blend is the perfect afternoon tea. Best served in the traditional fashion, hot with milk and sugar.

Pomegranate Mojito Green Tea: A unique spin off of the Cuban Mojito, a drink traditionally featuring the zesty flavors of mint and lime. Pomegranate gently compliments these predominate flavors against a smooth and delicate green tea base. This tranquil blend is perfect for a summer afternoon, and is delicious both hot and iced.


Caffeine: Approximately 150 mg/ cup - About the same as a cup of coffee!

Just what's in Essiac

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Type: Black Tea









We looked to American icons when creating this blend and what’s more American than Apple Pie? Unfortunately, football and the Grand Canyon didn’t make for great teas. This blend of premium Orange Pekoe black tea smothered in real bits of apple and cinnamon is a nod to your grandmother’s 4th of July specialty.
 




Tea Base: Flower Orange Pekoe
Base Region: South India
