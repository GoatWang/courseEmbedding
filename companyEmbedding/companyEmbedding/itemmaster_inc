Joining a growing network of retailers, e-tailers and mobile developers including Walmart, Jet, Instacart, Google Express, Peapod and Stop & Shop, these new partners are actively engaging with ItemMaster to access needed content and data support for brands in today's data driven market. Since becoming independent in 2016, ItemMaster has executed a rapid expansion strategy that included moving their content platform to the cloud, and building new content service solutions while dramatically accelerating the total number of manufacturer brands and verified products in their Brand Activation™ Platform. 
"ItemMaster is excited to be able to directly support Winn-Dixie, BI-LO, Gelson's Market, Schnucks, Hy-Vee and a growing list of other retailers in both the traditional and e-commerce grocery space," says Michael Murray, CEO of ItemMaster. "There is no question, better manufacturer content drives more sales in this omni-channel market, and we want to make this easier and better for manufacturers, retailers and their shoppers everywhere."

"We're excited to partner with ItemMaster and to be a part of their expanding Retail Exchange Network. At SEG, we are looking for the very best manufacturer content to support our Master Data Management initiative in order to better serve our customers. ItemMaster has the most comprehensive and complete content and with their new on-site Brand Activation Center, we are confident that we can work with them, and our manufacturers, to solve our product content needs for every product supported throughout the organization," said Southeastern Grocers' SVP of Supply Chain, Steve Strachota. Southeastern Grocers is the parent company to BI-LO, Winn-Dixie, Harveys and Fresco y Más; with over 730 stores in their network, SEG is the fifth-largest conventional grocery chain in the U.S. and the second-largest grocer in the southeastern region.
Also new to ItemMaster's Retail Exchange Network is Gelson's Markets, a specialty grocery store chain which operates 25 full-service stores in Southern California with a focus on high-quality products and delivering the local flavor of a neighborhood.  John Bagan, CMO at Gelson's Markets, said, "At Gelson's we have high standards for quality and service; we've always focused on delivering to those standards throughout all aspects of our business, which is why we partnered with ItemMaster. ItemMaster ensures that our product content needs are met by working directly with manufacturers from whom we purchase. Complete product information is critical."

7.   Changes
                                        in Agreement, Fee Schedule or itemMaster Service. 


 


itemMaster
                                    may at any time change any of the terms of this Agreement or the
                                    itemMaster fee schedule including, but not limited to, the amount
                                    of, or basis for determining, any fees or charges for the itemMaster
                                    Service. If itemMaster makes material changes to this Agreement or
                                    changes to the itemMaster fee schedule, itemMaster will provide
                                    notice to you in a manner provided in this Agreement. Your use of
                                    the itemMaster Service after any such change will be conclusively
                                    deemed acceptance of such change. itemMaster may discontinue or
                                    revise any or all aspects of the itemMaster Service without prior
                                    notice to you. Price and availability of products are also subject
                                    to change without notice. We reserve the right to correct online
                                    pricing errors. In such event, we reserve the right to correct the
                                    pricing error or cancel undelivered orders for such incorrectly
                                    priced products. You will be contacted in such circumstances, and
                                    your credit card or checking account will not be charged. If any
                                    change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your itemMaster
                                    Service and terminate this Agreement.

                                entity(s) or persons to these Terms of Service. If your application or site enables third parties, including end
                                users, to provide Product Data to itemMaster, it must clearly and conspicuously disclose to such third parties
                                that their Product Data will be provided to itemMaster and made available to the general public through the
                                itemMaster Service. Also, if your application or site enables third parties to provide Product Data to
                                itemMaster, it must use one of the user authentication methods set forth in the itemMaster documentation. In
                                connection with itemMaster, you may not use or share end user itemMaster Account information for any purpose
                                other than to implement the authentication methods set forth in the itemMaster documentation. If this Agreement
                                is terminated for any reason, you agree to delete all end user itemMaster Account information, including but not
                                limited to usernames and passwords. You understand and agree that Product Data submitted through the Service may

6. General Practices Regarding Use and Storage.



You agree that itemMaster has no responsibility or liability for the deletion
                                or failure to store any Product Data and other communications maintained or transmitted by the itemMaster
                                services. You acknowledge that itemMaster has set no fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may
                                send or receive through itemMaster services or the amount of storage space used; however, we retain the right,
                                at our sole discretion, to create limits at any time with or without notice.



7. Your Account.

                                required by registration for the itemMaster Service ("Customer Registration Data"), including, but not limited
                                to, your legal name, billing and delivery addresses and telephone number, and promptly to notify itemMaster of
                                any change in your Customer Registration Data. Upon registration, you will be issued a customer identification
                                number and password allowing you access to the itemMaster Service. Your password should be kept strictly
                                confidential to prevent unauthorized use. You agree to notify itemMaster promptly of any unauthorized use of
                                your password or your account or loss or theft of your credit card or bank account number. You will remain
                                liable for any use of the itemMaster Service until you notify itemMaster of the unauthorized use, loss or
                                theft.



8. Fees, Payment and Access.



You are responsible for, and agree to pay promptly, all charges to your
                                account, including applicable taxes and purchases by you or anyone you allow to use your password or I.D.

                                with the then current itemMaster fee schedule which can be accessed online. If you fail to pay any fees or
                                charges when due under the itemMaster fee schedule (which includes returned checks, electronic payment rejection
                                or damages arising from fraudulent use), itemMaster may reserve the right to stop listing your Product Data. You
                                shall be responsible and liable for any fees, including attorneys' fees and collection costs, that itemMaster
                                may incur in its efforts to collect any unpaid balances from you. itemMaster reserves the right to establish a
                                credit limit for your account. Your right to use the itemMaster Service is also subject to limits established by
                                your credit card issuer.



9. Changes in Agreement, Fee Schedule or itemMaster Service.



itemMaster may at any time change any of the terms of this Agreement or the
                                itemMaster fee schedule including, but not limited to, the amount of, or basis for determining, any fees or
                                charges for the itemMaster Service. If itemMaster makes material changes to this Agreement or changes to the
                                itemMaster fee schedule, itemMaster will provide notice to you in a manner provided in this Agreement. Your use
                                of the itemMaster Service after any such change will be conclusively deemed acceptance of such change.
                                itemMaster may discontinue or revise any or all aspects of the itemMaster Service without prior notice to you.
                                Price and availability of products are also subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to correct
                                online pricing errors. In such event, we reserve the right to correct the pricing error or cancel undelivered
                                orders for such incorrectly priced products. You will be contacted in such circumstances, and, of course, your
                                credit card or checking account will not be charged. If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your
                                itemMaster Service and terminate this Agreement.

ItemMaster does an amazing job taking the burden off of my company by not only being the conduit of information to our customers, but also by pulling our active products from store shelves and creating the imagery themselves!
