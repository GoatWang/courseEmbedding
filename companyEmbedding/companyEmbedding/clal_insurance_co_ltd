No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

What is 'Damage to Tangible Property'?    
Newsletters


February 07 2008



Product Regulation & Liability
Israel


 Facts
 Decision
 Comment



The Tel Aviv District Court accepted the position of Clal Insurance Co that a product liability policy covers only physical damage caused to third-party property, not financial damage allegedly sustained thereby. In addition, such damages were specifically excluded from coverage under the recall exclusion.
Facts 
The plaintiffs, Fuel Pipeline Co Ltd and the Infrastructure and Energy Co Ltd, were engaged in fuel transportation. They purchased steel pipes for an underground pipeline from Middle East Tube Co, the insured.
Following the installation of the pipeline, pressure tests revealed leakage. In order to trace the location of the leaks, the plaintiffs conducted several examinations, after which it became necessary for them to excavate all 26 kilometres of the pipeline and to check for leaks section by section. Five tiny leakage points were discovered - the result of defects in the pipes which probably occurred during the production process.
The plaintiffs claimed IS3.5 million (approximately $900,000) for the expense of tracing the leaks and replacing the defective pipes.
Claim 
The plaintiffs sued the insured and Clal, which had issued the insured's product liability policy, on the basis of the direct privity afforded by the Insurance Contract Law 1981 for a direct claim against a liability insurer.
The insured filed a third-party notice against Clal, maintaining that if the court were to impose liability on the insured for defects in the product, the plaintiffs' damages should be covered by Clal's policy.
Insurer's argument 
Clal declined coverage on the following grounds:

The policy covered only physical damage caused to third-party property as a result of defects in the insured's product. The policy was not intended to cover failure of the product to perform and the plaintiffs' damages were financial, not physical; therefore, they were not covered.
The policy specifically excluded loss relating to damage to the product itself, such as repair, reconditioning, modification or replacement. As the plaintiffs' expenses related to damage to the product (ie, the pipes) and the costs arising from their replacement, such expenses were excluded.
During the negotiations before the policy was issued, Clal specifically advised the insured that losses relating to damage to the product were not covered. Therefore, the insured had no reasonable expectation that such damages would be covered under the policy.

Decision 
After hearing evidence and summations, the court accepted the plaintiffs' contention and ruled that the defects in the pipes occurred at the insured's plant. Therefore, the insured bore full liability to compensate the plaintiffs for their damages to an amount of IS1 million, which was proven.
As to policy coverage, the court dismissed the claim and third-party notice against Clal, ruling that the claimed damages were not covered by the policy.
The court analyzed the terms of the operative clause, as well as the definitions of 'product' and 'damage' in the policy. The operative clause stated that: 

 "The insurers will indemnify and/or pay on behalf of the insured against their liability to pay compensation for and/or arising out of injury, damage and/or advertising liability (including claimants' costs, fees and expenses in accordance with the law of any country).
The indemnity applies only to claims made against the insured during the period of insurance specified in the schedule and arising out of the business specified therein in respect of product liability (including completed operations)."

The definition of 'damage' in the policy covered "damage to, or loss or destruction of, tangible property, including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom".
The dispute between Clal and the insured focused on the interpretation of the term 'tangible property' as included in the definition of the term 'damage'.
The court rejected the insured's interpretation that 'tangible' means "clear and definite" or "real"(1) and accepted Clal's position, which was supported by previous US judgments relating to these terms. Citing Douglas R Giddings v Industrial Indemnity Company,(2) the court interpreted the term 'tangible property' to mean 'physical property'. It stated that:

"Understood in its plain and ordinary sense, 'tangible property' means property, such as real estate, having physical substance apparent to the senses. To construe the explicit words 'tangible property' to include intangible economic interests and property rights requires a strained and far-fetched interpretation, doing violence to the plain language of the policies. Such an interpretation would rewrite the policies to fasten on the insurers a liability they have not assumed."

Therefore, the plaintiffs' costs and expenses in tracing the defects in the pipes were not covered under the policy, being purely financial losses.
Moreover, the court accepted Clal's argument that the plaintiffs' damages were excluded from coverage because of the exclusions specified in the policy, which stated as follows:

"This section does not cover liability for claims: 

(a) for damage to the product or part thereof, such as repair, reconditioning, modification or replacement; or
(b) arising out of the recall of any product (or part thereof) or of any property of which such product forms a part."

The court ruled that this section excluded any claim for damages to the product itself, including costs and expenses sustained for its repair and/or replacement. All of the plaintiffs' damages related to the failure of the product to meet its standards and to its replacement. Therefore, these damages were excluded from coverage.
Furthermore, the court was convinced that, before the inception of the policy, the insured had been aware that the policy did not cover non-physical damage to a third party. The insured attempted to purchase a special extension to cover such damage, but this attempt failed when Clal refused to issue such an extension. Therefore, the court denied the insured's allegation that it had a reasonable expectation that the relevant damages would be covered under the policy.
Comment 
A product liability policy is intended to cover only physical damage to third-party property as a result of defects in the insured product. Therefore, damages to the product itself and/or costs and expenses relating to its replacement, including costs incurred to trace defects in the product, are not covered.

No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)

We understand the great diversity of the San Francisco Bay Area and the South Bay. At the San Jose local GEICO office, we have agents who speak Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Hindi. When you get a quote through our office, we'll make sure all your eligible discounts are applied. We make doing business with GEICO easy for you.
Spot Brent and his team in the community.
I'm a member of the Campbell Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Silicon Valley, and the Silicon Valley Capital Club. I also coach in the Almaden Little League.
Look for our San Jose insurance agents at local events such as the San Jose Sharks Street Rally or at San Jose State University football games. My office is also a drop-off site during the holidays for the Harvest Food Bank and for the USMC Toys for Tots. Stop by and say "hello!"
