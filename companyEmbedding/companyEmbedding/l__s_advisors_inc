Tactical Equity Income | L&S Advisors



















































Strategies









      Tactical Equity Income    

Strategy Objective
The Tactical Equity Income Strategy seeks income through yield and capital appreciation primarily from the tactical and unconstrained investment in risk-appropriate equities. As with all L&S tactical long/cash strategies, we protect capital in riskier markets by moving from equities up to 100% cash.
The Tactical Equity Income Strategy consists of a blend of 30-40 dividend-paying stocks and/or alternatives such as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). The primary focus is on large-cap U.S. equities, but it may also invest in foreign securities using American Depository Receipts (“ADRs”). Equities are chosen based on economic cycle, market sector, and fundamentals, with an emphasis on above-average earnings, revenue, and cash flow projections for the next 12 months.
Clients may choose between 2 versions of the Tactical Equity Income Strategy: one that invests in MLPs directly and another that avoids MLPs, gaining exposure instead through exchange traded funds (ETFs).

Core Client
The core client for this strategy would be a risk-intolerant client seeking primarily income with a secondary emphasis on capital growth.

Strategy Highlights

Tactical all-cap core, domestic and international (ADRs)
Invests primarily in individual equities, with a primary focus on stocks with a strong dividend yield
May seek income from alternative investments such as MLPs, REITs, or commodity ETFs when appropriate
Can be concentrated, including up to 100% cash (Treasury bills or U.S. government money market funds)


Key Benefits of All L&S Strategies

Active long/cash allocation. We aim to maximize returns in low-risk markets by investing in what we believe to be promising equities and preserve capital in riskier climates by moving at any time up to 100% cash.
Disciplined, data-driven risk management. We make tactical decisions based on rigorous economic data tracking and top-down macroeconomic analysis.
Unconstrained approach. We don’t limit ourselves to a single style box or market capitalization. We’re free to pursue what we believe to be the best opportunities across the entire stock universe.
NO leverage, options, shorting, or currency hedging, reducing complexity and fat-tail risk.
Less volatility and downside risk. Designed in an effort to reduce volatility and downside risk in comparison to traditional buy-and-hold strategies.

Disclaimer | L&S Advisors





















































Disclaimer








      Disclaimer    

L&S Advisors, Inc. (“L&S”) is a privately owned corporation headquartered in Los Angeles, CA.   L&S was originally founded in 1979 and dissolved in 1996. The two founders, Sy Lippman and Ralph R. Scott, continued managing portfolios together and reformed the corporation in May 2006. The firm registered as an investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2006. L&S performance results prior to the reformation of the firm were achieved by the portfolio managers at a prior entity and have been linked to the performance history of L&S Advisors. The firm is defined as all accounts exclusively managed by L&S from 10/31/2005, as well as accounts managed in conjunction with other, external advisors via the Wells Fargo DMA investment program for the periods 05/02/2014, through the present time.
L&S claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®).  L&S has been independently verified by Ashland Partners & Company LLP for the periods October 31, 2005 through December 31, 2015 and ACA Performance Services for the periods January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Upon a request to Sy Lippman at slippman@lsadvisors.com or by clicking here, L&S can provide the L&S Advisors GIPS Annual Disclosure Presentation which provides a GIPS compliant presentation as well as a list of all composite descriptions.
L&S performance shown includes that of the Tactical Equity Opportunities (“TEO”) Composite, TEO WRAP Composite, Tactical Equity Income (“TEI”) Composite and TEI WRAP Composite which contains fully discretionary accounts per that specific strategy. The TEO and TEO WRAP Strategies seek growth through capital appreciation primarily from the tactical and unconstrained investment in risk-appropriate individual equities. The TEI and TEI WRAP Strategies seek income through yield and capital appreciation primarily from the tactical and unconstrained investment in risk-appropriate equities. WRAP strategies are appropriate only for those clients whose account is on a WRAP platform. Composite performance results have been calculated by using time-weighted returns based on the beginning of period values on an adjusted capital basis. Performance results are total return and include the reinvestment of all income. For the periods prior to March 31, 2011 for TEO WRAP and December 31, 2014 for TEI WRAP, net of fee performance reflects the reduction of the highest WRAP fee charged (3.00% annually) and gross of fee performance has been reduced by transaction costs. For all other periods for TEO WRAP and TEI WRAP, net of fee performance reflects the deduction of actual wrap fees charged and gross of fee performance has not been reduced by transaction costs. Other than brokerage commissions, wrap fees include investment management, portfolio monitoring, consulting services, and in some cases, custodial costs. For TEO and TEI non-wrap strategies, net of fee performance reflects the deduction of actual management fees and transaction costs. For TEO and TEI non-wrap strategies, gross of fee performance has been reduced by transaction costs. Cash flows equal to or greater than 10% of an account’s market value will cause the portfolio to be re-valued. Valuations and returns are computed and stated in U.S. dollars. Past performance does not guarantee future results and other calculation methods may produce different results. Results include accounts no longer with the firm. The minimum stated account size for the TEO and TEI non-wrap strategies is $2,000,000; however, actual minimums may vary by client. The minimum account size for the TEO WRAP and TEI WRAP strategies is $75,000; however, actual minimums may vary by platform. Inception performance is as of October 31, 2005.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a price-weighted average of 30 significant stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 TR Index is a free-float capitalization-weighted index of the prices of 500 large-cap common stocks actively traded in the United States and is calculated on a total return basis with dividends reinvested. The Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index is a market capitalization-weighted index, maintained by Barclays Capital; the index is designed to reflect investment grade bonds traded in the United States. Indexes are not available for direct investment.
