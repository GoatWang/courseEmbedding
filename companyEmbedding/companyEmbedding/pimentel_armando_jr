This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Top Buys by Top Brass: President of GP Pimentel Jr.'s $191.2K Bet on NEP

A company's own top management tend to have the best inside view into the business, so when company officers make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass'' over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $191.2K by Armando Pimentel Jr., President of GP at NextEra Energy Partners LP (Symbol: NEP).   Purchased Insider Title Shares Price/Share Value   07/14/2017 Armando Pimentel Jr. President of GP 5,000 $38.23 $191,150.00      Pimentel Jr.'s average cost works out to $38.23/share. Shares of NextEra Energy Partners LP were changing hands at $38.47 at last check, trading down about 0.1% on Tuesday. The chart below shows the one year performance of NEP shares, versus its 200 day moving average:       Looking at the chart above, NEP's low point in its 52 week range is $23.90 per share, with $39.83 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $38.47.    The current annualized dividend paid by NextEra Energy Partners LP is $1.46/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 05/04/2017. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for NEP, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 3.8% annualized yield is likely to continue.       According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, NEP makes up 12.76% of the YieldCo Index ETF (Symbol: YLCO) which is trading higher by about 0.3% on the day Tuesday.
