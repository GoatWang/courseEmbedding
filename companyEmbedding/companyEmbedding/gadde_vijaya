Twitter is appointing Vijaya Gadde as its new General Counsel after current appointee Alex Macgillivray has announced his plans to move on. The news came as a post on Macgillivray’s personal site and was shortly thereafter reported on by Mike Isaac at All Things D.
Techcrunch has confirmed both the departure of Macgillivray and the hire of Gadde with Twitter.
Macgillivray says that he is planning on dialing back his involvement with Twitter over the next few months as the team transitions to new leadership. “I’ll continue to support the company and its great people by staying on as an advisor for the legal, trust & safety, corporate development and public policy teams,” says Macgillivray. “I continue to care deeply about Twitter, the folks who work at Twitter and our tremendous users, so I’ll remain close to all three.”
Macgillivray was hired by Twitter in 2009 and previously served as DGC of Product at IP at Google. Gadde has been a director in Twitter’s legal department since July of 2011 and will now take on the GC role.
Macgillivray’s former post at Google had him going to bat for the company over its efforts to scan books. His move there was seen as a key ‘first amendment’ hire as Twitter began to be considered a platform for expression and came under attack from government agencies of various countries looking to quash or investigate statements made by users.
Gadde was formerly an associate at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, where Macgillivray was also formerly an attorney. Though Gadde doesn’t have the same bonafides as Macgillivray when it comes to first amendment stuff, she is apparently regarded well in the company and at her former firm.
In addition, from what we’ve heard, Twitter will be doing some shuffling of the legal structure as well. Its director of public policy Colin Crowell will no longer report to the General Counsel, but will report directly to CEO Dick Costolo on matters affecting Twitter and Washington.
All signs at the moment are pointing towards this being a voluntary exit for Macgillivray, who was well liked and respected. No one at Twitter is happy to see him go, as they might be with someone who wasn’t getting the job done. Macgillivray states in his post that he’s “looking forward to engaging my various internet passions from new and different perspectives, seeing friends and family without distraction, and just goofing off a bit.”
According to what we’re hearing, that’s essentially the core of why he’s leaving. Being the bastion of free speech at a hot target like Twitter can’t have been too relaxing or left a ton of free time to enjoy family. There’s also the fact that Macgillivray’s shares have vested after four years with the company.
As a bit of a going away present, Twitter officially won a patent case in the Federal Circuit court today which attempted to claim invention of Twitter’s messaging structure.

Mathew Scott—Fortune


Indian-born Gadde has proved vital to Twitter’s efforts at international expansion. While over 70% of the social media company’s 271 million users are overseas, it’s been banned in multiple countries. When the Turkish government blocked Twitter last March, Gadde and her 90-person legal team filed lawsuits in local courts, eventually prevailing. Also on her list of recent milestones: helping steer the company through one of the most anticipated (and unlike Facebook’s, incident-free) initial public offerings in recent years. Gadde, the only woman on Twitter’s executive team, says the most important aspect of her job is allowing as much content to flow freely while respecting local laws. A graduate of Cornell undergrad and NYU’s law school, Gadde previously spent close to a decade at the Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.

4
She's a big Kansas Jayhawks fan



5
She loves the show “The Walking Dead”



6
She's always cold at her office

Twitter exec on discrimination and overcoming adversity | Fortune.comMPWSearchSearchGovernmentHours After North Korea Missile Launch, Trump Reassigns Homeland Security ChiefFortune 500AT&T Executives to Run Combined Company After Time Warner DealCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDKatie CouricIt’s the End of the Katie Couric Era at YahooLeigh Gallagher (L) interviewed Twitter general counsel Vijaya Gadde (R) on Thursday night at Fortune's annual 40 under 40 event in San Francisco. Claudine Gossett--Drew Altizer Photography40 Under 40Twitter’s top female exec on discrimination and overcoming adversityShalene GuptaOct 23, 2014Vijaya Gadde is no stranger to trying situations. As Twitter's (twtr) general counsel, she's faced plenty of challenges. Last year, she was key in the tech company's public offering -- and she recently helped Twitter successfully sue the Turkish government after the country blocked its use in March.“Whenever I face adversity, I think about what my parents went through,” Gadde told Fortune assistant managing editor Leigh Gallagher at Fortune's 40 under 40 event on Thursday night.Though Gadde was born in India, she didn't meet her father until she was three. As a poor graduate student in America, he wasn't initially able to support his family coming to America. When Gadde turned one, her mother headed to the states -- and two years later Gadde finally met her father.Her family moved to small town Texas. She said they were among a handful of Indians -- and the KKK had a significant local presence. “You don’t realize it when you’re a child,” she said, referring to the KKK's power; her father needed their permission to go door-to-door selling insurance. “But when you’re in high school you realize this isn’t right.”The situation's unfairness inspired Gadde to become a lawyer. “No one messes with lawyers,” Gadde said. Before joining Twitter in 2011, she spent nearly a decade working at Wilson Sonsini and then spent time in the legal department of Silicon Valley technology firm Juniper Networks.The transition wasn't initially obvious to Gadde. “I didn’t get Twitter when it came out,” she admitted. “My first tweet was about breakfast.” But the 2010 Egyptian uprising was a turning point for her. “I realized how powerful of a platform it can be,” she told the audience, “and I lobbied for a job there.”As for her successes? Gadde credits preparation, especially concerning Twitter's IPO. She said the company spent two years planning for the event, and they had an independent board ready "a year before.”That board had not a single female face on it -- until former Pearson (pso) CEO Marjorie Scardino joined after noisy public backlash.Gadde doesn't shy away from criticisms of tech companies' (like Twitter's) dearth of women in leadership roles. Though she's the only female on Twitter's executive management team, Gadde has some tough opinions on getting more women into leadership roles. Her thoughts are characteristic of someone who has been fighting since she was born: “All tech companies need women. But I’m a big believer in only putting women in these positions only if they deserve them.”Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Gadde had been at Juniper Networks for nearly a decade.
