Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NTS (NYSEMKT:NTS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

What are analysts saying about Citrix Systems stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Citrix Systems stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Shares of Citrix Systems have outperformed the Zacks-categorized 'Computer-Software' industry over the past one month. Though the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016, the announcement failed to impress investors owing to the lackluster views for first quarter and full-year 2017.  Moreover, the bottom line contacted on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter.  We also remain concerned about the adverse impact of foreign exchange movements on the company's bottom line. Increased competition in the industry also raises concerns. Citrix Systems, recently, completed the spin-off and merger of its GoTo products with LogMeIn, Inc.." (3/28/2017)
2. Mizuho analysts commented, "There have been multiple media articles indicating Citrix could be exploring its sale, which we think is possible, but not fully certain given significant challenges in putting such a large deal together. We think a private equity buyer could potentially make the deal work around $100 per share by slashing costs further and monetizing the maintenance revenue base. On a fundamental basis, we see a path to the low $90s if the company benefits from Microsoft's product cycle. We are raising our PT to $94 from $85 and maintaining our Buy rating" (3/14/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 9 Hold Ratings, 7 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.28)Consensus Price Target: $92.67 (16.21% upside)
