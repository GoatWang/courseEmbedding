				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7.

1 This offer is valid for new or existing BancWest Investment Services, Inc. ("BWIS") customers, and is limited to one "Eligible Account" (as defined below) per customer.  The maximum cash bonus allowable for an Eligible Account is $2,500 within a six-month period.  "Qualifying Assets," for purposes of this offer, shall mean assets (i.e., cash, securities, fixed and variable annuities, and real estate investments trusts) deposited or transferred into the Eligible Account from outside BWIS or any BWIS affiliate within 60 days of enrollment, minus assets withdrawn or transferred out of Eligible Accounts within such 60-day period.  Life insurance holdings and other assets not listed above are not "Qualifying Assets" and are not eligible for this offer. Qualifying Assets will be valued at the time BWIS receives such assets.  An "Eligible Account" is a BWIS account that holds Qualifying Assets, and that has been enrolled to receive this offer prior to depositing or transferring any Qualifying Assets.  Eligible Accounts do not include any account the inclusion of which is prohibited by law or may result in a breach of any fiduciary duty, law or regulation, including, but not limited to, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").  Customers with Qualifying Assets of $50,000-$74,999.99 may receive a bonus in the amount of $200; customers with Qualifying Assets of $75,000-$249,999.99 may receive $300; customers with Qualifying Assets of $250,000-$499,999.99 may receive $700; customers with Qualifying Assets of $500,000-$999,999.99 may receive $1,250; customers with Qualifying Assets of $1,000,000 or more, may receive $2,500. If all requirements for this offer are met, Qualifying Assets will be calculated as of the 60th day after enrollment and the cash bonus will be credited to the Eligible Account within six weeks. The minimum Qualifying Assets for the applicable bonus amount must be maintained in the Eligible Account for one year from the date on which BWIS receives such assets or BWIS may charge the account the amount of the bonus. Any applicable taxes associated with the cash bonus are the responsibility of the BWIS account holder. To the extent required by law, BWIS will report the total value of this bonus to the IRS on Form 1099-INT for the applicable tax year in which the bonus was paid. Customers should consult a tax professional to determine the appropriate tax treatment for this bonus offer.

Copyright © 1977-2017 California Cryobank. All rights reserved.
While pregnancy and childbirth are among the most natural things in the world, conception is something that does not necessarily come easily for a great many people. For over 30 years, thousands of husband and wives, single women, and same-sex couples have turned to California Cryobank (CCB) for expert help in realizing their dreams of having a family. CCB is more than just a sperm bank; we are an industry leader in reproductive services with a commitment to stringent quality control and a passion for providing our clients with a successful experience.

Donor Program
Our sperm bank donors are hand-picked and screened intensely before being accepted into our donor program. The quality of our donors is the foundation of our service, with less than 1% of all applicants making it through the selection process. Potential donors are subjected to an exhaustive medical, genetic, and psychological screening—as well as a detailed examination of their background and family medical history. In fact, it is this superior qualification process that sets us apart from other sperm banks. Our screening is detailed and far-reaching to ensure that our clients are provided the best of the best.


Artificial Insemination Preparation
While the decision to undergo artificial insemination is a significant moment in our clients' lives, the process of using donor sperm doesn't need to be difficult or stressful. At California Cryobank we talk you through the process of preparing for your artificial insemination, including providing questions you need to ask your medical provider about the type of specimen and how many vials to purchase in order to meet your individual family goal. We'll work with our clients to help them narrow down their choices using all available resources we provide including audio interviews, essays, and even staff impression reports. We want to provide our members with as much information as possible so that they are ultimately as comfortable with their decision as possible.


Our Staff
Our staff is responsible for the expert, quality care for which California Cryobank is known. The California Cryobank team consists of physicians, medical directors, genetic counselors, and lab technicians—all working together for the common good of our clients. Those who choose California Cryobank are expertly guided through the process—working with everyone from Client Service Consultants to Donor Matching Consultants who help narrow down the choices between donors. We are hands-on every step of the way and always available to answer all of your questions. Our goal is to always ensure the highest quality standards in order to maximize each client's chances for a successful pregnancy and realizing their dream of having a child.


More Than a Sperm Bank
In addition to our donor program, California Cryobank offers a variety of services including private storage options for semen, eggs, or embryos, cord blood banking, genetic counseling, Andrology services, and post-conception services.At California Cryobank we are committed to the entirety of reproductive services-giving our clients the highest quality of care every step of the way.

Donor Selection


Your ideal donor is just a few clicks away
California Cryobank provides the largest and most diverse selection of sperm donors anywhere in the world. When choosing your donor sperm, you want to make sure all your important criteria are met -- which is why CCB recruits a wide variety of outstanding individuals for our donor pool at our sperm bank. Whether it is education, athleticism, religion, ethnicity, build, complexion, musicality, facial features, or artistry you are interested in (or any combination), CCB has the right donor for you.
Most sperm banks' donor recruiting is limited by their single location. CCB’s four donor labs are spread across the country, allowing us to not only recruit from many of the country’s top universities (UCLA, USC, Stanford, Harvard, MIT)*, but also from the major metropolitan cities surrounding them.
More importantly, CCB provides quantity without sacrificing quality. Our strict donor qualification process eliminates over 99% of all applicants. High educational and physical standards, personal and family medical history, multiple semen and blood analyses, genetic screening, and a series of extensive interviews are used to find the highest caliber sperm donations possible.
More choice means you have a better chance of finding your ideal donor. Why settle for anything less? Take a few minutes to run a search and see just how many choices you really have!

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.

Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.

1 This offer is valid for new or existing BancWest Investment Services, Inc. ("BWIS") customers, and is limited to one "Eligible Account" (as defined below) per customer.  The maximum cash bonus allowable for an Eligible Account is $2,500 within a six-month period.  "Qualifying Assets," for purposes of this offer, shall mean assets (i.e., cash, securities, fixed and variable annuities, and real estate investments trusts) deposited or transferred into the Eligible Account from outside BWIS or any BWIS affiliate within 60 days of enrollment, minus assets withdrawn or transferred out of Eligible Accounts within such 60-day period.  Life insurance holdings and other assets not listed above are not "Qualifying Assets" and are not eligible for this offer. Qualifying Assets will be valued at the time BWIS receives such assets.  An "Eligible Account" is a BWIS account that holds Qualifying Assets, and that has been enrolled to receive this offer prior to depositing or transferring any Qualifying Assets.  Eligible Accounts do not include any account the inclusion of which is prohibited by law or may result in a breach of any fiduciary duty, law or regulation, including, but not limited to, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").  Customers with Qualifying Assets of $50,000-$74,999.99 may receive a bonus in the amount of $200; customers with Qualifying Assets of $75,000-$249,999.99 may receive $300; customers with Qualifying Assets of $250,000-$499,999.99 may receive $700; customers with Qualifying Assets of $500,000-$999,999.99 may receive $1,250; customers with Qualifying Assets of $1,000,000 or more, may receive $2,500. If all requirements for this offer are met, Qualifying Assets will be calculated as of the 60th day after enrollment and the cash bonus will be credited to the Eligible Account within six weeks. The minimum Qualifying Assets for the applicable bonus amount must be maintained in the Eligible Account for one year from the date on which BWIS receives such assets or BWIS may charge the account the amount of the bonus. Any applicable taxes associated with the cash bonus are the responsibility of the BWIS account holder. To the extent required by law, BWIS will report the total value of this bonus to the IRS on Form 1099-INT for the applicable tax year in which the bonus was paid. Customers should consult a tax professional to determine the appropriate tax treatment for this bonus offer.  Employees or associated persons of FINRA, any FINRA member firm (other than BWIS), or a U.S. exchange are not eligible for this offer. Employees, associated persons, and customers of First Hawaiian Bank and First Hawaiian Investment Services are not eligible for this offer.  Offer is non-transferrable and only valid in the United States. BWIS reserves the right to modify or cancel this offer at any time.  Void where prohibited.

Copyright © 1977-2017 California Cryobank. All rights reserved.
While pregnancy and childbirth are among the most natural things in the world, conception is something that does not necessarily come easily for a great many people. For over 30 years, thousands of husband and wives, single women, and same-sex couples have turned to California Cryobank (CCB) for expert help in realizing their dreams of having a family. CCB is more than just a sperm bank; we are an industry leader in reproductive services with a commitment to stringent quality control and a passion for providing our clients with a successful experience.

Donor Program
Our sperm bank donors are hand-picked and screened intensely before being accepted into our donor program. The quality of our donors is the foundation of our service, with less than 1% of all applicants making it through the selection process. Potential donors are subjected to an exhaustive medical, genetic, and psychological screening—as well as a detailed examination of their background and family medical history. In fact, it is this superior qualification process that sets us apart from other sperm banks. Our screening is detailed and far-reaching to ensure that our clients are provided the best of the best.


Artificial Insemination Preparation
While the decision to undergo artificial insemination is a significant moment in our clients' lives, the process of using donor sperm doesn't need to be difficult or stressful. At California Cryobank we talk you through the process of preparing for your artificial insemination, including providing questions you need to ask your medical provider about the type of specimen and how many vials to purchase in order to meet your individual family goal. We'll work with our clients to help them narrow down their choices using all available resources we provide including audio interviews, essays, and even staff impression reports. We want to provide our members with as much information as possible so that they are ultimately as comfortable with their decision as possible.


Our Staff
Our staff is responsible for the expert, quality care for which California Cryobank is known. The California Cryobank team consists of physicians, medical directors, genetic counselors, and lab technicians—all working together for the common good of our clients. Those who choose California Cryobank are expertly guided through the process—working with everyone from Client Service Consultants to Donor Matching Consultants who help narrow down the choices between donors. We are hands-on every step of the way and always available to answer all of your questions. Our goal is to always ensure the highest quality standards in order to maximize each client's chances for a successful pregnancy and realizing their dream of having a child.


More Than a Sperm Bank
In addition to our donor program, California Cryobank offers a variety of services including private storage options for semen, eggs, or embryos, cord blood banking, genetic counseling, Andrology services, and post-conception services.At California Cryobank we are committed to the entirety of reproductive services-giving our clients the highest quality of care every step of the way.

We help take the mystery out of this unique process
There is no substitute for experience. At California Cryobank, our staff has helped thousands of families over the years and is excited to do the same for you.
From our physician owners, to our medical directors, on-staff genetic counselors, and lab technicians, our high standards of expertise and medical ethics are second to none.
Our Client Services Team includes multiple members with over 20 years experience at CCB – longer than most sperm banks have even been in business. With another few at 15+ years and a dozen or so more 10+ year veterans, many of our staff members have had the pleasure of watching donor babies grow into toddlers, teenagers, and young adults.
CCB ships specimens throughout the United States and to over 40 countries worldwide. If you wish to speak to a bilingual staff member, an appointment may be required. Please contact our Client Services Representative at 866-927-9622 for further details.

HOW MANY VIALS DO I NEED?


								National averages range from 3-4 insemination cycles per successful pregnancy.
								We recommend purchasing at least 5 vials per child to guarantee your donor remains available until reaching your personal family goals.
								Additionally, you get 1 YEAR FREEstorage if you purchase 5 or more vials ($475 value).
							


							WHY SHOULD I THINK ABOUT STORING VIALS?
						


								Our donors sell out and retire quickly! We have thousands of clients forced to choose between a new donor or not having a second child because they chose not to store vials for future use while they were available.
								To help you plan for your future, we offer 3 YEARS FREE storage if you purchase 10+ vials ($1,050 value) - as well as the ability to sell back any unused vials that have not left our control.

Whether it is education, athleticism, religion, ethnicity, build, complexion, musicality, facial features, or artistry you are interested in (or any combination), CCB has the right donor for you.
Most sperm banks' donor recruiting is limited by their single location. CCB’s four donor labs are spread across the country, allowing us to not only recruit from many of the country’s top universities (UCLA, USC, Stanford, Harvard, MIT)*, but also from the major metropolitan cities surrounding them.
More importantly, CCB provides quantity without sacrificing quality. Our strict donor qualification process eliminates over 99% of all applicants. High educational and physical standards, personal and family medical history, multiple semen and blood analyses, genetic screening, and a series of extensive interviews are used to find the highest caliber sperm donations possible.
More choice means you have a better chance of finding your ideal donor. Why settle for anything less? Take a few minutes to run a search and see just how many choices you really have!

HOW MANY VIALS DO I NEED?


								National averages range from 3-4 insemination cycles per successful pregnancy.
								We recommend purchasing at least 5 vials per child to guarantee your donor remains available until reaching your personal family goals.
								Additionally, you get 1 YEAR FREEstorage if you purchase 5 or more vials ($475 value).
							


							WHY SHOULD I THINK ABOUT STORING VIALS?
						


								Our donors sell out and retire quickly! We have thousands of clients forced to choose between a new donor or not having a second child because they chose not to store vials for future use while they were available.
								To help you plan for your future, we offer 3 YEARS FREE storage if you purchase 10+ vials ($1,050 value) - as well as the ability to sell back any unused vials that have not left our control.
