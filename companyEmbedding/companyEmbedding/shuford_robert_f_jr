This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Robert F. Shuford Jr. is the third generation of Shufords to serve on the board of Old Point National Bank. Last year, he helped the bank's net interest income grow by 30.13 percent and was chosen to serve as the 2015-2016 chair of the Virginia Peninsula Chamber of Commerce.Shuford, chief operating officer, director and senior executive vice president of Old Point National Bank, has been with the bank since 1998. Prior to that, he earned a degree in biomedical engineering from Duke University and worked in the biomedical field.He is also a graduate of the Virginia Bankers Association School of Bank Management, the Civic Leadership Institute, and the BAI Graduate School of Bank Operations and Technology.
Shuford's father, Robert F. Shuford Sr., has been executive chairman, president and chief executive officer at Old Point Financial Corp., the parent company of the bank, since 1965. The elder Shuford also serves as the chairman of Old Point National Bank.Rob Shuford, as the younger banker is called, talked about his banking career, his role this year with the chamber and what he does when he's not at the bank or a community function.In 2015, he looks forward to actively watching the Peninsula and greater Hampton Roads economy grow."On the Peninsula we have a wealth of resources such as the Jefferson Lab, NASA and the National Institute of Aerospace, so there's no reason why the Peninsula can't be No. 1 in the state for technology startups. We have some work to do - but that's our mission."What got you interested in banking? Did you feel like it was something you had to do?I had previously been working in the U.S. military as a naval officer and then in the biomedical engineering field. My wife and I decided to move back to Virginia when she was pregnant with our third child, and I was looking for a change.Banking offers a diverse landscape in regards to leadership and business skills and it encompasses everything you would find at a typical business. It's a really rich business career as far as the type of skills you can use.I had an opportunity to get into banking on the technology and operations side, so I could transfer the skills that I used in the military and biomedical startup companies.I was able to add a whole bunch of stuff to my repertoire; it's a really interesting career because anything you can find in any other business career you can find in banking.What have been some challenges you've faced in banking in the past year? What do you expect for 2015?The last several years have been challenging for all banks because of the economy. In Hampton Roads we've been slow to recover. We've seen unique challenges because of our reliance on the government and the Department of Defense. We've been hit hard with sequestration.In the past two years, we've seen progress across the boards, and we're seeing that 2015 won't show any major leaps forward, but more of a slow progression of improvement across all sectors.Old Point had a successful year with a 30.13 percent increase in net income. What contributed to that?Growth in loans. When the economy was not as good and loan volume was hard to come by, the assets were primary in low-yielding securities, so we've moved more assets from securities to loans.We also saw improvement because of a reduction in net interest expenses. We've had a definite strategy to increase the amount of relationship money. The entire team has been focusing on relationship money, because it has a much lower cost, and it brings in other relationships, such as positional loans.





Our focus is relationship-oriented banking.How did you become involved in the Peninsula chamber?Old Point has always been a supporter of the Peninsula chamber and the other area chambers. I got involved a number of years ago and have always enjoyed being on the board, and I rotated on and off for a while. When Kasia Grzelkowski [president and CEO of VersAbility Resources], was the chair, she wanted to take the board in a different direction, and she asked me to join the board.We are working very diligently with Mike Kuhns, [president, CEO and secretary of the Virginia Peninsula Chamber of Commerce], who is just amazing, to raise the credibility of the Virginia Peninsula Chamber of Commerce.What are some goals for the Peninsula chamber this year?We want to improve the overall business environment on the Peninsula, so we're looking at some of the root causes for why we have a low startup rate. We want to foster discussions on how we can make it easier for startups to grow because that's the engine behind the economy in any area.
We have a great deal of programs that center around creating startups, and we have all kinds of courses to help create a business plan and support growth as well as a great leadership program.Lead Peninsula is a great program for middle level management, and it promotes leadership in the business community. We're also very focused on activities around young people. Until we are able to bring the best and brightest back to the Peninsula then we can't live up to the Peninsula's potential. We have the Youth Leaderships Institutes and the Young Entrepreneurs Academy, YEA!, which exposes young people to creating and executing a real business plan. We think programs like that will reach out to young people and expose them to the richness of the Peninsula so they feel more connected professionally to the Peninsula and will look to come back home after college or military training.Can we expect to see a continued relationship between the Peninsula chamber and the Hampton Roads chamber?We have a good partnership with the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce. My co-worker, Joe Witt, who is the senior executive vice president at Old Point, is the 2015 chair of the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce. Our offices at the Old Point headquarters in Hampton are right next to each other, so we're always talking to each other. We're always looking for ways to partner together, and one organization with great potential is the Hampton Roads Regional Council. [The council is a place where leaders of the chambers and other local organizations update each other on local efforts.] Joe and I are now both part of that organization, and we're looking for ways to create unity in the region.The Peninsula chamber and the Hampton Roads chamber will continue to meet jointly a few times a year, which fosters a lot of friendships and networking opportunities between members on the Peninsula and those on the Southside.What are you looking forward to in 2015?I think the same thing that everyone is - an overall improving economy. With Hampton Roads being so dependent on military and government, our recovery hasn't been as strong as other areas. We need to make it easier to do business and create our own engine for economic growth that isn't reliant on the government.I think Hampton Roads has an amazing wealth of resources between the port and Newport News Shipbuilding and we're strong players in modeling and simulation, and with NASA and the National Institute of Aerospace, there is no reason why Hampton Roads can't come roaring back from the recession and re-invent Hampton Roads.I'm a big believer in the Hampton Roads Community Foundation's Re-invent Hampton Roads headed by Debbie DiCroce, and I think they are looking to do great things.How do you spend your free time?These days it doesn't seem like I have a whole lot of free time. My wife and I spend it with our three children. We have one in college, a senior in high school and a sophomore in high school. We've spent the last three years going to theater performances for the oldest one and a lot of soccer games and swim meets. That takes up a lot of free time and is a wonderful way to spend the evening.
