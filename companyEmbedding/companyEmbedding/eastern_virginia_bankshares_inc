The Company's results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were directly impacted by increases in the average balances of loans, interest-bearing deposits and short-term borrowings. Loan yields decreased 9 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, largely due to intense competition for commercial loans in the Richmond and Tidewater markets. Rates paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 9 basis points primarily due to a promotional rate offered on money market savings accounts.   
In connection with the previously disclosed pending merger of equals with Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc. ("Southern National"), the Company incurred $478 thousand in merger and merger related expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Also, as previously disclosed, and related to the Company's continued commitment to drive operating efficiencies and reduce noninterest expenses, during the fourth quarter of 2016 the Company implemented a hiring freeze. In connection with this hiring freeze, through attrition and other job eliminations, the Company reduced the number of its full-time equivalent employees by 27 between December 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017. The Company currently expects this initiative to reduce salaries and employee benefits expense by approximately $1.4 million on an annualized basis.
In announcing these results, Joe A. Shearin, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, "I am pleased with our Company's growth and profitability for the first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, we generated loan growth of 3.7% as compared to 17.9% over the trailing twelve months, which again outpaced our internal targets. Net income decreased by 20.1% during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016 and was primarily driven by a lower net interest margin, higher current period expenses, including those related to our pending merger with Southern National, and partially offset by higher net interest income. The lower net interest margin was driven by lower yields on loans and higher costs on interest-bearing deposits, while the overall increase in net interest income was primarily due to our strong loan growth. Current period expenses included $478 thousand related to our pending merger with Southern National, $165 thousand in severance costs associated with our hiring freeze and job eliminations, and a $194 thousand loss on the sale of one other real estate owned property. Excluding these non-recurring expenses, our overall profitability for the first quarter of 2017 improved when compared to the same period of 2016."
Shearin continued, "We continue to be very excited and focused on our pending merger of equals with Southern National and the combination of EVB with Southern National's wholly owned subsidiary Sonabank. Both banks are working diligently to incorporate best practices and processes, and making great progress towards creating an outstanding organizational structure and strong banking franchise. To date we have received all necessary regulatory approvals to proceed with the merger, and earlier this month Southern National filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which included a joint proxy statement and a preliminary prospectus. We are very excited about the future prospects and synergies of our combined organization and look forward to maximizing the potential of this combined franchise. I am also pleased to announce that the Board of Directors declared another cash dividend of $0.03 per share of common stock and Series B Preferred Stock payable on May 19, 2017 to shareholders of record as of May 5, 2017."  
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the following were significant factors in the Company's reported results:

Increase in net interest income of $931 thousand from the same period in 2016 principally due to an increase in interest and fees on loans driven primarily by loan growth, partially offset by decreases in interest income on taxable investment securities and increases in interest expense associated with our deposits and short-term borrowings; 
Net interest margin (tax equivalent basis) decreased 12 basis points from the same period in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the yield earned on average loans, higher average balances of and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities and a decrease in the average balances of and yields earned on investment securities, partially offset by an increase in average loans; 
Other real estate owned decreased by $1.0 million during the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the sale of one property with a cost basis of $1.3 million; 
Performing troubled debt restructurings decreased from March 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017 by $4.5 million primarily due to the collection of principal on two previously restructured loans; 
Increase in salaries and employee benefits of $542 thousand from the same period in 2016, primarily due to merit increases, severance costs associated with our hiring freeze and job eliminations, staffing changes and increased incentive compensation expense related to improved financial performance; 
Marketing and advertising expenses decreased $228 thousand from the same period in 2016 due to the timing of advertising campaigns and other initiatives and a reduction in branding activities due to the pending merger with Southern National; 
Loss on sale of other real estate owned increased from the same period in 2016 primarily due to the sale of one property for $1.2 million for which the Company incurred a loss of $194 thousand; 
Merger and merger related expenses of $478 thousand were incurred during the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the pending merger with Southern National; and 
Other operating expenses increased $280 thousand from the same period in 2016, primarily due to increases in data processing expenses and director fees.

Interest Income and Expense
Net interest income and net interest margin
Net interest income in the first quarter of 2017 increased $931 thousand, or 8.5%, when compared to the first quarter of 2016. The Company's net interest margin (tax equivalent basis) decreased to 3.66%, representing a decrease of 12 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in the net interest margin (tax equivalent basis) was primarily due to a decrease in the yield earned on average loans, higher average balances of and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities and a decrease in average balances of and yields earned on investment securities. These margin pressures were offset by increases in average loan balances. Total interest and dividend income increased 10.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 while total interest expense increased 26.1%, both as compared to the same period in 2016. The most significant factors impacting net interest income during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 were as follows:
Positive Impact:

Increases in average loan balances, primarily due to organic loan growth and loan purchases, partially offset by lower loan yields.

Negative Impacts:

Decreases in average balances of and yields earned on investment securities resulting from changes in the composition of the investment securities portfolio driven by the Company's liquidity needs; 
Increases in average interest-bearing deposit balances and rates paid, in each case primarily due to the Company offering a promotional rate for its money market savings accounts; and 
Increases in average short-term borrowings balances and rates paid, primarily due to loan growth outpacing deposit growth.

Loans 
Average loan balances increased $147.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to organic loan growth and the purchase of $32.3 million in performing commercial, student and consumer loans between March 2016 and March 2017. Loan growth during the three months ended March 31, 2017 outpaced our internal targets. However, loan growth in our rural markets, especially with respect to consumer loans, remains weak while competition for commercial loans, especially in the Richmond and Tidewater markets, has been and we expect will continue to be intense given the historically low rate environment. Total average loans were 78.6% of total average interest-earning assets for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to 76.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. 
Investment securities
Average total investment securities balances decreased by $9.5 million, or 3.5%, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. This decline was the result of management of the investment securities portfolio in light of the Company's liquidity needs, with proceeds provided by sales and pay downs of investment securities used primarily to fund loan growth, and unrealized losses on the available for sale investment securities portfolio. The Company remains committed to its long-term target of managing the investment securities portfolio to comprise 20% of the Company's total assets.  
Interest-bearing deposits
Average total interest-bearing deposit balances and rates paid increased for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the Bank offering a promotional rate on money market saving accounts and an increase in brokered and other time deposits obtained through a non-brokered listing service.
Borrowings
Average total borrowings increased for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to increased short-term borrowings. Average short-term borrowings increased for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, due to additional FHLB advances taken to fund loan growth.
Noninterest Income

Key changes in the components of noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, are discussed below:

Gain on sale of available for sale securities, net was lower as adjustments made in the prior year to the composition of the investment securities portfolio as part of the Company's overall asset/liability management strategy generated gains that were not repeated during the three months ended March 31, 2017; and 
Other operating income increased primarily due to higher earnings from the Bank's subsidiaries and its investment in Bankers Insurance, LLC, partially offset by losses from the Bank's investment in Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC. Other operating income also includes losses from the Bank's investment in housing equity funds.

Key changes in the components of noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, are discussed below:

Salaries and employee benefits increased due to severance costs associated with our hiring freeze, job eliminations, and other staffing related changes, merit increases and increased incentive compensation and pension plan costs; 
Telephone expenses were higher due to additional expenses related to our data center relocation; 
Consultant fees decreased as certain engagements were completed in 2016 and were not repeated in 2017; 
Collection, repossession and other real estate owned expenses were higher due to an increase in equipment repossession and foreclosure activity; 
Marketing and advertising expenses were lower due to the timing of advertising campaigns and other marketing expenses and a reduction in branding activities related to the pending merger with Southern National; 
Loss on sale of other real estate owned incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily due to the sale of one property for $1.2 million for which the Company incurred a loss of $194 thousand; 
Impairment losses on other real estate owned incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2017 were the result of lowering the sales price on two properties; 
Merger and merger related expenses incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2017 were for legal fees and other costs associated with the pending merger with Southern National; and 
Other operating expenses increased primarily due to increases in data processing expenses, internet banking expenses, director fees, legal fees, franchise taxes, HELOC closing expenses, other losses and write offs and appraisal expenses.

Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc., Sonabank, Southern Trust Mortgage management enter into agreement with Middleburg Bank to purchase Middleburg Bank's interests in Southern Trust MortgageEastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc.Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc., Sonabank, Southern Trust Mortgage management enter into agreement with Middleburg Bank to purchase Middleburg Bank's interests in Southern Trust MortgageCompany Release - 03/27/2014 13:45TAPPAHANNOCK, Va., March 27, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVBS), the holding company for EVB, Southern National Bancorp of Virginia Inc. (NASDAQ: SONA), the holding company for Sonabank, and Jerry Flowers of Southern Trust Mortgage (STM), announced today that the two banks and Jerry Flowers have reached an agreement with Middleburg Bank to purchase the 62 percent of STM currently owned by Middleburg Bank. Upon the closing of the transaction, Jerry Flowers and other STM executives will own 51.1 percent of STM, Sonabank will own 44 percent and EVB will own 4.9 percent. STM is a mortgage banking company headquartered in Virginia Beach. It was founded in 1998 by Jerry Flowers, and has mortgage banking originators in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina.  Southern Trust Mortgage only originates retail mortgage production.STM is an approved Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, VA and FHA lender. In addition, Southern Trust Mortgage is one of a select few lenders to have received approval from Ginnie Mae to issue securities on its behalf. Having all agency approvals greatly expands the mortgage products and, therefore, expands EVB's ability to positively impact the lives of our customer base with mortgage products suited to every economic spectrum. The continuation of our seven year relationship will help expand our consumer real estate services with additional STM loan officers in more of our EVB branch locations. STM will originate non-conforming residential mortgage loans for EVB's residential mortgage loan portfolio in their markets in accordance with credit criteria provided by EVB.  Joe Shearin, CEO of Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc, and EVB stated "We have worked with Southern Trust Mortgage for many years and are excited to build upon this relationship which will help to expand our existing mortgage products while continuing to provide high quality service to our customers.  Southern Trust is a well managed company that has come through many mortgage industry business cycles with a solid reputation for quality and customer service." Jerry Flowers, President of STM commented: "We are very excited to have Sonabank as our new Banking partner along with EVB who we have been doing business with for the past seven years. Having EVB and Sonabank as partners, will allow us to expand in their market areas and will give us banking partners that not only want to be a part of STM's existing model but would like for us to expand our mortgage footprint."Eastern Virginia Bankshares, Inc. is a bank holding company with assets of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2013. The Company's banking subsidiary, EVB, operates twenty-one full service branches in eastern Virginia located in the counties of Essex, Gloucester, Hanover, Henrico, King William, Lancaster, Middlesex, New Kent, Northumberland, Southampton, Surry and Sussex and the City of Colonial Heights.Forward-Looking Statements    Certain statements contained in this release that are not historical facts may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Under the terms of the Agreement, each share of common stock of Virginia Company Bank will be converted into and become the right to receive the following consideration, at the election of the shareholder: $6.25 in cash without interest, or 0.9259 shares of common stock of EVBS (subject to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares). The Agreement provides that no more than 25% of the outstanding common shares of Virginia Company Bank will be converted into cash consideration.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
