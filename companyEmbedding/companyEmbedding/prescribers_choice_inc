July News

Happy July!Quick TipsTreating you skin in the summer is a little different then treating your skin in the winter.  Some of us are under the impression that we need to stop all treatments and home care for our skin in the summer.  The good news is that we don't.  It can sometimes be challenging, yes, but still possible.  It is important to know about the medication that you are using.  Some medications may cause "photo sensitivity", meaning your skin will sunburn more easily.  Examples of medications that make you more sensitive to the sun include:  doxycycline (Acticlate), isotretinoin (Accutane), retinoids (tretinoin, tazorac, adapalene).  It is important to protect your skin during the summer.  Wearing your sunscreen and a hat is always recommended.  Be conservative about your sun exposure before and after treatments and while specifically using a photosensitizing medication.  You will be able to maintain results with your skin, just keep caution in mind.  If you have any specific questions regarding your treatments or home care during the summer, please do not hesitate to call our aesthetician!  She would be glad to assist.Fun Fact:  Lime juice can cause you to get a severe sunburn if it gets on your skin.  So, be careful if you enjoy a good Corona with lime while sitting on the beach this summer!New at the office...With rising co-pays and insurance restrictions, it has become very challenging to prescribe effective medication at an affordable price.  In addition, pharmacies will frequently disregard a doctor's prescription and dispense a less effective (and sometimes non-equivalent) generic medication as opposed to the more effective brand-name product.  Sometimes it feels like the doctors' prescription pad is now just a "suggestion pad"!   We at Center City Dermatology understand that it is patients who lose when they can't get the right medication to treat their condition.  That's why we are now working with a laboratory, Prescriber's Choice, that is able to tailor the highest quality topical dermatology medications for our patients at an affordable price.  By creating unique combinations of pharmaceutical and natural ingredients that work together to enhance efficacy in the skin, we are able to provide a better product.  Combining several medications into one product increases the ease of use and reduces out of pocket expenses (why use 2 or 3 different creams per day to treat your condition when you can use just one that has all the necessary components?).  This process also allows us to customize medications that are not currently available at retail pharmacies (e.g. spironolactone gel, 10% minoxidil, etc).  And for the same cost as the typical co-pay for a single generic medication, you get a superior product containing multiple medications that is more effective and easier to use.  Now you can pick up many of your topical medications right here in our office.  No more trips to the pharmacy or waiting for mail-order prescriptions.  Center City Dermatology strives to be the only stop you need to make for all of your skin care needs.July Promotion: OBAGI Summer SaleCenter City Dermatology will be offering 20% off all OBAGI products for the month of July.  This also includes the OBAGI Radiance peel.  Help us keep your skin radiant this summer.Please remember to discontinue all topical acne treatments (e.g. benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, adapalene, tazarotene), at least three days prior to a chemical peel.   View our Aesthetic MenuFLASH DEAL:  July 24th ONLY20% off Resylane Silk.  This product is perfect for around the lips.  Making them soft, supple and full.  If you have lost lip volume this is the product for you.  It creates a very natural enhancement of the lips. Don't forget to ask about our "Throwback Rewards" program. Let us help you achieve the beautiful skin you deserve.

Sales Consultant

What do you stand for? What motivates you? Do you want to leave a mark on this world?

Case studies









Since the beginning of time, doctors are seeing people in need. They examine them, give them medication, and check on them a few weeks later. Sounds simple, right?
Let's see how an average dermatology visit looks like today:





Patient A (let's call her "Alice") goes to see her dermatologist. After her visit her doctor writes her 4 prescriptions.
She then travels to her pharmacy where she waits for the prescriptions to be filled. After some time she is told that some of her prescriptions are not covered and one needs a prior authorization as a result of her insurance’s constraints.




The pharmacy now contacts the doctor’s office informing them of the situation. The patient must now wait for a response from the office, because of the busy office and busy pharmacy it is unlikely this will be resolved that day. The patient goes home without medication and waits for the doctors office to do the prior authorization and make substitutions for the other prescriptions.










The physician’s office is burdened with the time consuming process of submitting for the prior authorization and calling for medication substitutions. Many offices have a team of employees dedicated to handling medication substitutions and prior authorizations from the pharmacy. They are disgruntled with the process, the cost of the copays, the substitution to a substandard drug, and ultimately medication non adherence.




Once all is said and done, Alice gets 3 prescriptions paying 3 copays upwards of $75.00 each ($225.00) and one prescription that remains uncovered, that has an out of pocket expense of $800. That she cannot afford and does not fill.







We are not satisfied with the above routine! We believe that healthcare delivery can be more effective, and we've already proved our below concept.
How does a visit look like with Prescriber's Choice™?







Patient C (let's call her "Claire") goes to see her dermatologist who has incorporated the Prescriber's Choice™ model into their practice. During her visit with the doctor, custom medication is prepared using multiple active ingredients commonly found in separate commercially available products.









 The medication is dispensed to Claire at her point of care. It is sold to the patient for $40.00, an amount less than a tier 3 copay at the pharmacy.









Claire leaves the physicians office satisfied. She understands the medication prescribed, is more likely to be compliant with only one medication, and will demonstrate good outcomes.






These case studies represent real patients' experience at the pharmacy. Their names have been modified to allow for privacy.  Please read to fully understand the value of the Prescriber's Choice model.
Case #1

Many offices have a team of employees dedicated to handling medication substitutions and prior authorizations from the pharmacy. They are disgruntled with the process, the cost of the copays, the substitution to a substandard drug, and ultimately medication non adherence.






Once all is said and done, Alice gets 3 prescriptions paying 3 copays upwards of $75.00 each ($225.00) and one prescription that remains uncovered, that has an out of pocket expense of $800. That she cannot afford and does not fill.





Case #2



Patient B (let's call her Barbara) goes to see her dermatologist. After her visit her doctor writes her 4 prescriptions.






She then travels to her pharmacy where she waits for the prescriptions to be filled. After some time when she goes to pay for her prescriptions she is shocked to find that two of her prescriptions are non-formulary and have very high copays, and the other two are not covered, resulting in a bill of several hundred dollars.






Dismayed, Barbara leaves the pharmacy abandoning all the prescriptions not taking any of them.






The physician is never informed. It is not until Barbara's follow up appointment that the physician is made aware Barbara never started the prescribed treatment. The physician is discouraged that their prescribed regimen was not followed and their patient has not improved. This may result in the physician losing the patient to a competitive dermatologist.





Case #3 (the Prescriber's Choice™ model)



Patient C (we can call her Claire) goes to see her dermatologist who has incorporated the Prescriber's Choice™ model into their practice. During her visit with the doctor custom medication is prepared using multiple active ingredients commonly found in separate commercially available products. The medication is dispensed to Claire at her point of care.






The dispensed medication is sold to the patient for $40.00, an amount less than a tier 3 copay at the pharmacy.






Claire leaves the physicians office satisfied. She understands the medication prescribed, is more likely to be compliant with only one medication, and will demonstrate good outcomes.






The physician monetizes their practice, reduces the stress of prior authorizations, and eliminates time consuming medication substitutions. Excess staff is now reduced or reallocated to productive functions in the office.

 Patient's & doctor's time is wasted
 Doctor's office is burdened
 Doctor's office loses money instead of making money with prescriptions
 Patient & doctor are frustrated







 Case #2



 Patient's time is wasted
 Doctor's efforts are wasted

 Case #3

Frequently Asked Questions
DO PATIENTS REALLY WANT THIS?
Yes! Three out of four (75%) of Americans would prefer to have their prescription(s) filled
                            in their doctor’s office instead of a retail pharmacy if given the choice. 84% feel it would
                            be more convenient, and 62% feel it would help them better manage their health.
                            
*Research was conducted by Opinion Research Corporation.

IS IT RIGHT FOR MY PATIENTS?
Studies have shown that up to 30% of patients never get their prescriptions filled. When
                            patients leave your office with medication in hand, compliance rates dramatically increase.
                            Not including travel time, wait times at many pharmacies can be hours.
                            In-Office-Physician-Dispensing is especially meaningful for your patients who are suffering
                            acute sickness, pain, are elderly or have young children. Patients appreciate receiving
                            medications in your office to avoid a trip to the pharmacy and waiting for their
                            prescription to be filled.
HOW DOES IT IMPROVE MY PATIENT'S CARE & SATISFACTION?
Besides the added convenience, you consult with your patient as they receive their
                            medication. You get to have an open discussion with them about taking the medications
                            intervals, completing the regimen as directed, and verbally warning them of interactions
                            that may occur with any other medications you know they are taking. Compliance with drug
                            therapy is 60% to 70% better when medications are delivered at the point of care than when
                            patients are handed a written prescription. Care and satisfaction is quickly improved
                            because you can monitor your patient’s process and progress while providing concierge level
                            service for your patients.
WILL IT SAVE ME TIME & MONEY?
You will spend the about same amount of time on prescription related issues as you do today
                            (on average 1-1.5 hours a day per Physician). Today that time is spent making your practice
                            no revenue, by dispensing you will convert that lost time into revenue for
                            your practice, all while providing better care for your patient.
IS IN-OFFICE-PHYSICIAN-DISPENSING LEGAL?
Yes, physicians are allowed to dispense medications. The patient must be yours and the
                            medication must be distributed in your practice environment. There are other guidelines and
                            restrictions you should be aware of as they can vary state by state. Contact one of our
                            Consultants to discuss the guidelines and restrictions within your state.
WILL I TAKE ON ADDITIONAL LIABILITY WITH
                            IN-OFFICE-PHYSICIAN-DISPENSING?
You will not take on any additional liability. It’s the same as if you were to write a
                            prescription that was filled by a pharmacy. However there are guidelines for packaging and
                            labeling which our service helps you with.
DO I NEED A SPECIAL LICENSE TO DISPENSE MEDICATION?
The rules vary by state. Our Consultants can assist you in understanding what is needed for
                            your state.
IS PRESCRIBER'S CHOICE HIPAA COMPLIANT?
Yes, all of our software for managing your dispensing needs are HIPAA compliant.

How does it work?
Prescriber's Choice™ brings a unique approach to physician dispensing. For the first time, you
                    will be able to provide your patient with a customized solution that can be distributed at the point
                    of care. Prescriber's Choice was created to assist physicians with their patients by improving,
                    patient education, compliance, and ultimately enhanced outcomes.

Start Dispensing
Start dispensing your own custom labeled proprietary formulations, directly from your
                                in-house lab. You can be dispensing in as little as 1-3 weeks.






Increased Care
Providing customized solutions at the time of visit, you will increase understanding,
                                compliance, outcomes and overall patient satisfaction.






Reduce Costs
This model reduces overall costs and the burden on the healthcare system.




Doctors are burdened with administrative tasks in their practice, generated by the insurance
                    companies. While most of these issues are money- and time-related, there is a task that directly
                    affects the care of the patient - prior authorizations.



Physician costs for interacting with insurance
                            companies and health plans add up to $37 billion annually. Most of this is associated with
                            prior
                            authorizations and formulary requirements.



Practices spend up to 20 hours a week on prior authorization requests alone. These practices spend as much time dealing with insurance companies, as they spend on everything else combined.



70% of patients who encounter prior authorization, do not receive the originally prescribed medication, but rather a substitution.



Specialty medications have limited or NO substitutions. From 2013 to 2015, the amount of medication that required prior authorization quadrupled.




what was once called a prescription pad is now more of a "suggestion pad."

America has an issue with medication non-adherence. Research indicates that patients receiving their medication at the time of their visit, are much more likely to follow doctor's instructions.
