   News  Oneok Partners LP (OKS), Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD), Kinder Morgan Management, LLC (KMR): Earn Great Income With Upside Potential    Published on August 7, 2013 at 9:10 am by  
                                The Motley Fool
                                  in News         Page 1 of 2Next &gt&gtSee All           Note: This article has been amended to correct Enterprise Products Partners dividend yield. A 0% interest rate environment has created a crowd of hungry-for-yield investors. With rates so low, you have two options — either stash your money in CDs earning close to nothing, or invest in highly speculative investments. Well, now there’s also a third way: invest your money in financial vehicles called MLPs. These partnerships will reward you with exceptionally high dividend payouts that you can count on. In fact, MLPs are required to pay out the majority of their income as dividends, similar to REITs. Although dividend yields have been historically much higher, the average MLP still boasts a healthy 5.7%. That’s almost three times as high as an average S&P 500 company. The best of both worlds Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) are a form of corporate organization that carry the tax benefits of a partnership. Because MLPs do not have to pay corporate taxes, they have more cash available to fund their distributions and pay hefty dividends to their unit-holders. In particular, you can find many MLPs in the gas pipeline energy business. The energy revolution in the U.S hasn’t gone unnoticed, and these MLPs are trying to take advantage of it. With natural gas (NG) becoming so cheap, abundant, and popular (unlike “dirty” coal) — the stage is set for its revival. And the great beneficiaries of this revival would be companies that are engaged in the NG industry. This means that today, you can enjoy both worlds — have an unlimited upside potential, and receive a healthy income stream from the dividends paid by MLPs. The most successful candidates out there  I’ve listed below three superior MLPs. All three exhibit a conservative balance sheet – one with a reasonable amount of debt compared to cash, a proven ability to generate a consistent stream of cash flow, and most importantly – all three have a great growth potential.  ONEOK is more than just OK Oneok Partners LP (NYSE:OKS) is the largest independent operator of natural gas gathering pipelines and processing plants in the Williston BasinThe company specializes in natural gas gathering and processing, natural gas pipelines, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). It’s one of the biggest U.S. companies in all three businesses, with an enterprise value of $15.8 billion. Of the three, NGLs are Oneok Partners LP (NYSE:OKS)‘s biggest business and its biggest source of growth. NGLs were less than 20% of Oneok Partners LP (NYSE:OKS)‘s business in 2006. Today, they are more than 60%, and still the fastest-growing part.  Oneok Partners LP (NYSE:OKS) just completed its $600 million, 600-mile,12-inch Bakken NGL pipeline in April. It’s got an initial capacity of 60,000 barrels per day. Oneok Partners LP (NYSE:OKS) will invest $100 million on additional pumping stations to increase the pipeline’s capacity to 135,000 barrels per day. This is the first pipeline ever to transport NGLs from the Williston Basin to key market centers in Conway, Kansas and to the Gulf Coast. That’s how this company is positioning itself to grab market share. With long-term debt of $6.5 billion and annual cash flow from operations just shy of $1 billion, the company’s balance sheet is one of the most conservative ones in the industry. Oneok Partners LP (NYSE:OKS) is currently trading for less than nine times free cash flow. That’s really cheap, especially when you consider its 5.6% dividend yield. A high-quality enterprise Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is the largest publicly traded energy partnership in the U.S., with an enterprise value of more than $70 billion. It operates one of the largest pipeline networks in the country. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD)‘ total estimated 2014 NGL fractionation capacity is 610,000 barrels per day. That’s 37.4% of the total fractionation capacity in the area – more than any other company.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

OneOK headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma on 20 March 2007


ONEOK, Inc. is a diversified Fortune 200 corporation based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ONEOK was founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, but It changed its corporate name to ONEOK in December 1980. ONEOK is a general partner and owns 41.2 percent of ONEOK Partners, LP which is one of the largest publicly traded limited partnerships in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas. It also owns major natural gas liquids (NGL) systems due to the 2005 acquisition of Koch Industries natural gas businesses.
ONEOK's Energy Services operation focuses primarily on marketing natural gas and related services throughout the U.S. Energy Services, which derives more than 84 percent of its earnings from the physical marketing business, showed an operating income increase of $26.5 million. Energy Services’ retail business participates in customer gas choice program in Nebraska and Wyoming.
On December 22, 2005, The ONEOK Foundation said it would donate $1 million this winter to assist residents in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with their energy bills.[3]
In 2007, Fortune magazine named ONEOK the most admired company in the energy industry.[4]
ONEOK's predecessor, Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG), had been headquartered in an Art Deco building on the northwest corner of Seventh Street and Boston Avenue in Tulsa since 1928. In 1982, ONEOK chairman, J. E. Tyree, announced plans to demolish the ONG building and replace it with a new 16-story tower. However, this did not happen. Instead, ONEOK bought the Cities Service Company (later renamed Citgo) in August, 1982. The acquired company already had a project underway to build a high-rise headquarters building at Fifth and Boulder. ONEOK realized that it would be more economical to cap the planned structure at 17 stories and move its headquarters there, rather than to proceed with its original plan. It completed the new black granite and glass tower in 1984.[5]
In 2009, ONEOK sponsored the construction of ONEOK Field, the new Tulsa Drillers minor league baseball stadium in downtown Tulsa.

History[edit]




Oklahoma Natural Gas Company headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma built in 1928


Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG) was founded in 1906 by two attorneys, Dennis T. Flynn and Charles B. Ames, who planned to develop the natural gas that was a byproduct of the northern Oklahoma oilfields. ONG incorporated on October 9, 1906, under the laws of Oklahoma Territory. Flynn was president and Ames the secretary. Joined by Chicago entrepreneur, H. M. Byllesby, for whom they worked, they also formed the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (OG&E) to bring natural gas from the Cleveland Oil Field to Oklahoma City, using it to generate electric power. Byllesby soon resigned, but Glenn T. Braden and Theodore N. Barnsdall joined ONG. Both were already experienced oilmen. Together, they owned the Osage and Oklahoma Gas Company. Braden had been an executive of Standard Oil Company and Barnsdall an oil producer.[a] ONG built a natural gas pipeline from the Osage fields to Oklahoma City which went into service December 28, 1907. ONG extended the line to Guthrie and Shawnee. It also built the first gas pipeline compressor station in the state in 1910.[6] Braden followed Flynn as president of the company.
ONG continued to build pipelines throughout Oklahoma. By the time Braden retired in 1921, ONG owned over 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of lines and served over a half million customers in 48 of the state's 77 counties. In 1928, it built its noted headquarters building in Tulsa. It reorganized several times, first becoming a Maryland Corporation, then a Delaware Corporation.[6]
The board of directors voted to change the name of Oklahoma Natural Gas Company to ONEOK, Inc. in December 1980. The part of the corporation that operated utility services became a separate division named Oklahoma Natural Gas and headquartered in Oklahoma City. The parent company is headquartered in Tulsa.[6]
In February 2014, ONEOK spun off its natural gas distribution companies (Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Services, and Texas Gas Services) into a separate publicly traded company, ONE Gas.
Oklahoma Natural Gas, the company that started it all back in 1906, now operates as a division of ONE Gas.
Notes[edit]



^ Barnsdall owned the Barnsdall oil company and became the namesake of Barnsdall, Oklahoma.

ONEOK Partners' LP Surges on Merger Deal
Parent company ONEOK has agreed to acquire all the outstanding units of its MLP that it doesn’t currently own.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Feb 1, 2017 at 1:15PM

What happened
ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) jumped on the midstream consolidation bandwagon today, agreeing to acquire all the outstanding units of its master limited partnership, ONEOK Partners (NYSE:OKS), that it does not own. That agreement drove up the price of ONEOK Partners' units, which had risen more than 19% by 12:15 p.m. EST.
So what
ONEOK has offered to pay a 22.4% premium for each unit of ONEOK Partners it does not own in a unit-for-unit exchange. Under the terms of the agreement, each unit of ONEOK Partners will convert to 0.985 shares of ONEOK stock upon closing. That values the partnerships' outstanding units at $9.3 billion and will create a $30 billion company by enterprise value.
ONEOK's rationale is threefold. First, the deal will lower the combined company's cost of funding because it will eliminate the MLP's incentive distribution rights. Second, it is immediately accretive to ONEOK's distributable cash flow, enabling the company to increase its dividend by 21% in 2017. Finally, it sets a platform for growth, with ONEOK expecting to deliver 9% to 11% annual dividend increases through 2021 while maintaining 1.2 times dividend coverage.
This transaction is just the latest in a string of deals between MLPs and their general partners. In recent years Buckeye Partners (NYSE:BPL) swallowed up its general partner while Targa Resources (NYSE:TRGP) rolled up its MLP. Even more recently Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) agreed to a deal to acquire most of its MLP Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ), by eliminating the incentive distribution rights in exchange for receiving additional units. Overall, the driving force behind these deals is the removal of the high-cost incentive distribution rights that required MLPs to send an outsized portion of their income to their general partners. Eliminating these payments puts all investors on the same footing, which reduces capital market costs, enabling these companies to access cheaper financing.





Now what
Given the wave of consolidation in the midstream sector, it was only a matter of time before ONEOK and ONEOK Partners announced a similar transaction; the only question was which route they would choose. In this case, they opted to keep the corporation and not the tax-advantaged MLP, because this structure will allow for faster dividend growth over the next five years. For income investors, that clear visibility surrounding dividend increases is certainly appealing.

OneOK headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma on 20 March 2007


ONEOK, Inc. is a diversified Fortune 200 corporation based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ONEOK was founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, but It changed its corporate name to ONEOK in December 1980. ONEOK is a general partner and owns 41.2 percent of ONEOK Partners, LP which is one of the largest publicly traded limited partnerships in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas. It also owns major natural gas liquids (NGL) systems due to the 2005 acquisition of Koch Industries natural gas businesses.
ONEOK's Energy Services operation focuses primarily on marketing natural gas and related services throughout the U.S. Energy Services, which derives more than 84 percent of its earnings from the physical marketing business, showed an operating income increase of $26.5 million. Energy Services’ retail business participates in customer gas choice program in Nebraska and Wyoming.
On December 22, 2005, The ONEOK Foundation said it would donate $1 million this winter to assist residents in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with their energy bills.[3]
In 2007, Fortune magazine named ONEOK the most admired company in the energy industry.[4]
ONEOK's predecessor, Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG), had been headquartered in an Art Deco building on the northwest corner of Seventh Street and Boston Avenue in Tulsa since 1928. In 1982, ONEOK chairman, J. E. Tyree, announced plans to demolish the ONG building and replace it with a new 16-story tower. However, this did not happen. Instead, ONEOK bought the Cities Service Company (later renamed Citgo) in August, 1982. The acquired company already had a project underway to build a high-rise headquarters building at Fifth and Boulder. ONEOK realized that it would be more economical to cap the planned structure at 17 stories and move its headquarters there, rather than to proceed with its original plan. It completed the new black granite and glass tower in 1984.[5]
In 2009, ONEOK sponsored the construction of ONEOK Field, the new Tulsa Drillers minor league baseball stadium in downtown Tulsa.

History[edit]




Oklahoma Natural Gas Company headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma built in 1928


Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG) was founded in 1906 by two attorneys, Dennis T. Flynn and Charles B. Ames, who planned to develop the natural gas that was a byproduct of the northern Oklahoma oilfields. ONG incorporated on October 9, 1906, under the laws of Oklahoma Territory. Flynn was president and Ames the secretary. Joined by Chicago entrepreneur, H. M. Byllesby, for whom they worked, they also formed the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (OG&E) to bring natural gas from the Cleveland Oil Field to Oklahoma City, using it to generate electric power. Byllesby soon resigned, but Glenn T. Braden and Theodore N. Barnsdall joined ONG. Both were already experienced oilmen. Together, they owned the Osage and Oklahoma Gas Company. Braden had been an executive of Standard Oil Company and Barnsdall an oil producer.[a] ONG built a natural gas pipeline from the Osage fields to Oklahoma City which went into service December 28, 1907. ONG extended the line to Guthrie and Shawnee. It also built the first gas pipeline compressor station in the state in 1910.[6] Braden followed Flynn as president of the company.
ONG continued to build pipelines throughout Oklahoma. By the time Braden retired in 1921, ONG owned over 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of lines and served over a half million customers in 48 of the state's 77 counties. In 1928, it built its noted headquarters building in Tulsa. It reorganized several times, first becoming a Maryland Corporation, then a Delaware Corporation.[6]
The board of directors voted to change the name of Oklahoma Natural Gas Company to ONEOK, Inc. in December 1980. The part of the corporation that operated utility services became a separate division named Oklahoma Natural Gas and headquartered in Oklahoma City. The parent company is headquartered in Tulsa.[6]
In February 2014, ONEOK spun off its natural gas distribution companies (Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Services, and Texas Gas Services) into a separate publicly traded company, ONE Gas.
Oklahoma Natural Gas, the company that started it all back in 1906, now operates as a division of ONE Gas.
Notes[edit]



^ Barnsdall owned the Barnsdall oil company and became the namesake of Barnsdall, Oklahoma.

OneOK headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma on 20 March 2007


ONEOK, Inc. is a diversified Fortune 200 corporation based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ONEOK was founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, but It changed its corporate name to ONEOK in December 1980. ONEOK is a general partner and owns 41.2 percent of ONEOK Partners, LP which is one of the largest publicly traded limited partnerships in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas. It also owns major natural gas liquids (NGL) systems due to the 2005 acquisition of Koch Industries natural gas businesses.
ONEOK's Energy Services operation focuses primarily on marketing natural gas and related services throughout the U.S. Energy Services, which derives more than 84 percent of its earnings from the physical marketing business, showed an operating income increase of $26.5 million. Energy Services’ retail business participates in customer gas choice program in Nebraska and Wyoming.
On December 22, 2005, The ONEOK Foundation said it would donate $1 million this winter to assist residents in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with their energy bills.[3]
In 2007, Fortune magazine named ONEOK the most admired company in the energy industry.[4]
ONEOK's predecessor, Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG), had been headquartered in an Art Deco building on the northwest corner of Seventh Street and Boston Avenue in Tulsa since 1928. In 1982, ONEOK chairman, J. E. Tyree, announced plans to demolish the ONG building and replace it with a new 16-story tower. However, this did not happen. Instead, ONEOK bought the Cities Service Company (later renamed Citgo) in August, 1982. The acquired company already had a project underway to build a high-rise headquarters building at Fifth and Boulder. ONEOK realized that it would be more economical to cap the planned structure at 17 stories and move its headquarters there, rather than to proceed with its original plan. It completed the new black granite and glass tower in 1984.[5]
In 2009, ONEOK sponsored the construction of ONEOK Field, the new Tulsa Drillers minor league baseball stadium in downtown Tulsa.

History[edit]




Oklahoma Natural Gas Company headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma built in 1928


Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG) was founded in 1906 by two attorneys, Dennis T. Flynn and Charles B. Ames, who planned to develop the natural gas that was a byproduct of the northern Oklahoma oilfields. ONG incorporated on October 9, 1906, under the laws of Oklahoma Territory. Flynn was president and Ames the secretary. Joined by Chicago entrepreneur, H. M. Byllesby, for whom they worked, they also formed the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (OG&E) to bring natural gas from the Cleveland Oil Field to Oklahoma City, using it to generate electric power. Byllesby soon resigned, but Glenn T. Braden and Theodore N. Barnsdall joined ONG. Both were already experienced oilmen. Together, they owned the Osage and Oklahoma Gas Company. Braden had been an executive of Standard Oil Company and Barnsdall an oil producer.[a] ONG built a natural gas pipeline from the Osage fields to Oklahoma City which went into service December 28, 1907. ONG extended the line to Guthrie and Shawnee. It also built the first gas pipeline compressor station in the state in 1910.[6] Braden followed Flynn as president of the company.
ONG continued to build pipelines throughout Oklahoma. By the time Braden retired in 1921, ONG owned over 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of lines and served over a half million customers in 48 of the state's 77 counties. In 1928, it built its noted headquarters building in Tulsa. It reorganized several times, first becoming a Maryland Corporation, then a Delaware Corporation.[6]
The board of directors voted to change the name of Oklahoma Natural Gas Company to ONEOK, Inc. in December 1980. The part of the corporation that operated utility services became a separate division named Oklahoma Natural Gas and headquartered in Oklahoma City. The parent company is headquartered in Tulsa.[6]
In February 2014, ONEOK spun off its natural gas distribution companies (Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Services, and Texas Gas Services) into a separate publicly traded company, ONE Gas.
Oklahoma Natural Gas, the company that started it all back in 1906, now operates as a division of ONE Gas.
Notes[edit]



^ Barnsdall owned the Barnsdall oil company and became the namesake of Barnsdall, Oklahoma.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
