Fixed Income Investment

 Managing large portfolios for banks, insurance companies, trusts and large institutions requires a high level of experience and expertise. BTC Capital’s fixed income team combines both these elements and represents an excellent choice for organizations seeking managers experienced in constructing and managing sophisticated fixed income strategies.
Our highly disciplined approach to fixed income investment starts with an assessment of each client’s goals, risk preferences and expectations. From there, we execute a strategy based on the specific needs of each client. BTC Capital Management applies sophisticated technical applications to create strategic investment portfolios providing long-term, successful growth. 
While many of our fixed income strategies focus on managing benchmark sensitive portfolios we realize there are numerous clients where standard industry measures do not adequately define their investment goals and objectives. For these clients portfolios are created specifically to meet their unique needs and to measure results in the context of their stated objectives.

Investment Philosophy
Tenets of Investing
BTC Capital Management utilizes a highly disciplined, fundamentally based and risk aware approach in managing portfolios for our clients. Our investment philosophy is rooted in four primary tenets: 


 Preservation of capital during difficult markets. 
						    We believe preserving investment value in difficult markets is equally as important as generating strong returns in rising markets.
 Investment decisions based primarily on strong fundamentals.
 Long-term view of the markets. We believe markets generate short-term noise that often distracts investors from making sound investment decisions. We continually filter through the distractions and focus on the longer-term opportunity present in specific portfolio holdings.
 Risk-aware portfolio construction. We actively monitor portfolio risk relative to our benchmark and client objectives. Through the use of portfolio based factors, name limitations, sector weight constraints, portfolio characteristics and analytical tools, we are able to effectively balance the level of conviction surrounding an investment with the level of risk it contributes to the portfolio. This active risk budgeting provides a strong framework for the allocation of risk and return in the portfolio.

What are analysts saying about Oracle Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Oracle Corporation stock: 
1. KeyCorp analysts commented, "We focused on Oracle’s cloud transition, and how moving to the cloud can generate 3x the revenue per customer, as well as Oracle’s opportunity in the SaaS market. Oracle’s opportunity in cloud and SaaS, and valuation, have been the main area of investor push-back since our upgrade. As Oracle continues to execute on its cloud transition, we believe multiple expansion can continue. Key Investment Points Oracle on average could see 3x the revenue from a customer who moves its workload from on-premise to the cloud. Transitions at Autodesk and Adobe, showed lifetime customer value driven from the cloud is much higher than from on-premise. As Oracle moves its customers to the cloud, it should gain a similar benefit. For the customer, migrating to the cloud can lead to significant overall cost savings, based on labor and hardware costs needed to manage on-premise solutions." (7/18/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Oracle has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. The company's offerings in SaaS and PaaS have gained significant momentum in the past few quarters, which improves competitive position against salesforce.com and Workday. Further, the introduction of Gen 2 IaaS data centers is expected to improve Oracle’s competitive prowess against Amazon. We believe the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, estimates have been going up ahead of the company's Q4 earnings release. However, the transition from on-premise licensing to cloud-based subscription business model will take some more time to complete, which will impact upcoming results. Moreover, higher investments on IaaS will affect gross margin expansion. Further, a strong U.S. dollar remains a headwind." (6/15/2017)
3. UBS AG analysts commented, "Hardware and services misses in ORCL's F3Q results were handily offset by Cloud and a surprise license upside, with disciplined opex ' G&A especially low on 1x items ' delivering 42.5% OPM, +100bps ahead of consensus. A lower tax rate also helped (UBSe ~3c impact), lifting F3Q EPS to 69c or 7c ahead of Street. This marks the first Q since Nov'14 ORCL has beat both consensus revs and EPS, and combined with 1) healthy ARR growth +73% cc - renders the reiterated FY $2B +40% y/y target more achievable, 2) indications more operating efficiency can be had (headcount -800 q/q the largest since May'10) - still targeting double-digit EPS growth in FY18 by net income improvement vs. buyback driven share count reduction, 3) demonstrable balance sheet strength - ORCL announced an unanticipated +27% dividend increase with results; 4) reasonable valuation; and 5) optionality from tax reform we think shares could garner incremental interest with inflecting fundamentals providing the basis for ORCL's valuation disconnect to narrow vs. peers and market multiples; maintain Buy." (3/16/2017)
4. Wedbush analysts commented, "ORCL's 3Q/Feb. looked better than its 2Q performance, based on our calculations of organic results. As we expected, SaaS and PaaS metrics benefited from the addition of NetSuite, but they also looked better organically. Also, good cost control and an improved tax rate give us reasons to be more positive on the outlook for FY18 EPS growth. However, we remain concerned that consensus expectations for FY18 revenues (about 3% implied organic constant-currency Y/Y) look too high. Although margins could improve next year as optics benefit from the cloud transition, we think they could be pressured longer-term due to a more competitive cloud pricing environment for enterprise applications and database. We would stay on the sidelines." (3/16/2017)
5. Barclays PLC analysts commented, "If the company continues to deliver we think investors would need to re-think the story which could lead to multiple expansion. FX continues to be a headwind but we are starting to see increasing cash flow from the cloud transition story. Hence, we raise our price target to $51 from $47 and reiterate our Overweight rating." (3/16/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 11 Hold Ratings, 27 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.71)Consensus Price Target: $51.07 (0.19% downside)
