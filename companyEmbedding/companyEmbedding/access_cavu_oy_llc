Company Overview
Background
During World War II, Navy fighter pilots would look up at the sky and if it was a ‘CAVU’ day then it meant ceiling and visibility unlimited. The pilots believed they would have unobstructed flying allowing them to see their targets quicker, identify the obstacles they needed to overcome, giving them a greater chance of success.  The founders of CAVU Resources, Inc., CAVU, chose the name CAVU because they believe that the company will be the embodiment of its name.
In 2009, the founders of CAVU decided to roll their collective assets in the energy industry into one company that would have a unified vision and focus.  CAVU was formed to be a fully self-supported independent energy company – which we define as a company that has enough of its own equipment, services, leases, projects and assets to be able to keep most of the services needed in order to become a successful energy company ‘in-house.’ In the energy industry, one of the keys to success is being able to get access to field services in a timely and cost effective manner. This usually is only achieved by large companies who can contract services for multi-year contracts or by smaller independents like CAVU, who have own their own field services divisions.
With this key hurdle overcome, the CAVU’s founders then set about securing the next key ingredient to success: good people.  The CAVU’s has assembled a management team with diverse experience in the energy sector ranging from investment bankers to drillers to seasoned energy business professionals. Not only has CAVU assembled an experienced management team, it is also steered by an advisory committee that is comprised of respected and experienced professionals.
The General Partner was formed with the goal of becoming a recognized regional player in the independent oil and natural gas industry by growing the company’s oil and natural gas reserves.  CAVU is a natural resource company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties.  CAVU operates in the upstream segment of the oil and gas industry with planned activities including the drilling, completion and operation of oil and gas wells in Oklahoma, Montana, and Colorado.  CAVU also owns two pipelines in its area of operations, which will be used for gathering its gas and oil and the gas and oil production of other producers. CAVU has acquired leases and is currently exploring additional opportunities in oil, gas and wind energy leases.  CAVU has acquired significant oil and gas equipment including rigs, trucks and completion equipment.
The CAVU’s 100% owned subsidiaries, CAVU Energy Services, LLC, provides both conventional contract drilling and directional drilling services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Its 100% owned operating company FILO Quip Resources, LLC plans to expand operations not only in the traditional Oil and Gas business, but also to invest in Geo-Thermal and Wind, taking advantage of the changing environment and in the world’s need for new, green and innovative resources.
With a sound model and an excellent management team, the CAVU’s founders then began focusing on ensuring that its projects, or our products in this sector, are among the very best available in the country. To that end, CAVU is focusing primarily on oil and gas fields that have been previously developed and abandoned prior to 1980.  This strategy reduces risk and the impact of environmental issues usually faced with developing new fields.  CAVU has recently acquired leases that have producing oil and gas wells, and plans to start a multi-well drilling program during the fourth quarter of this year.
Initially, CAVU plans to provide energy investments opportunities to investors to finance the acquisition of projects, drilling of new wells and development of existing fields. As CAVU builds its own reserves and cash flows, it will then be able to self-finance its projects. Current opportunities are focused on the acquisition of several proven oil and gas fields where infield drilling and utilizing applications of surface chemistry can provide improved results.
To ensure that it could manage its own projects, CAVU owns two drilling rigs and the associated heavy support equipment.  Additionally CAVU has access to seasoned drilling crews both to work its own leases and to lease drilling services on a contract basis.
The CAVU’s business strategy will be growth through developing proven leases utilizing its core business assets in drilling and service to rework and re-condition exiting production.  Upon completion of a merger with a public company, CAVU will utilize its stock to acquire profitable related businesses and producing fields to increase revenue.  CAVU also plans to take advantage of its gas producing leases located in the mid-west wind corridor by leasing the land and developing wind farms.  This combined with planned co-generation plants will allow it to both provide electricity and sell its gas production through its own infrastructure to small towns and commercial locations in Oklahoma, Colorado and Montana.
