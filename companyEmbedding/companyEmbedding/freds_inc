Fred's June sales decline more than expected
Fred's Inc.  said Thursday that June sales were lower than expected, and are expected to hurt fiscal second-quarter results to the point that the drug store chain no longer expects improvement from the sequential first quarter. Total sales for the month fell 5.3% from a year ago to $197.5 million, while same-store sales declined 1.6%. company said combined pharmacy same-store sales increased 3.5%, but front store sales continued to face headwinds in consumer consumables categories, and with cooler than average temperatures hurting summer seasonal sales. "Our lower than anticipated June sales and the headwinds we are facing will impact our second quarter results, and we no longer expect sequential improvement from the first quarter," said Chief Executive Michael Bloom. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has plunged 60% year to date through Wednesday, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has lost 8.5% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Walgreens terminates Rite Aid merger, replaces with agreement to buy 2,186 stores
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  said Thursday that it has terminated its merger agreement with Rite Aid Corp.  and has instead agreed to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets. The consideration for the deal will be $5.175 billion in cash and the option for Rite Aid to become a member of the Walgreens group purchasing organization, an option that can be exercised through May 2019 and is subject to certain conditions. This new agreement replaces the merger agreement announced October 2015 and amended January 2017, along with the agreement to divest some Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc. , which was announced in December 2016. The agreement with Fred's has also been terminated and Walgreens will pay a $325 million termination fee. After the new transaction is approved, Walgreens will acquire the Rite Aid stores and assets over about six months and will eventually convert them to the Walgreens brand. Walgreens expects the transaction to be "modestly accretive" to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the initial closing, and expects synergies totaling $400 million that will be fully realized within three to four years. Walgreens shares are up 1.7% in premarket trading, Rite Aid shares are down 6.1%, and Fred's shares are down 27%. Walgreens shares are down nearly 7% for the year so far while Rite Aid shares are down more than 52% and Fred's are down 33.6% for the period. The S&P 500 index  is up 9% for 2017 to date.

Fred's stock plunges after deal to buy some Rite Aid stores was terminated
Shares of Fred's Inc.  plunged 27% in premarket trade Thursday, after the agreement to buy 865 Rite Aid Corp.  was terminated. The agreement was originally announced on Dec. 20, 2016. The termination comes after Rite Aid agreed to sell 2,186 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. , which also terminates the companies' merger agreement. Fred's said it will receive a $25 million termination fee. "This is a disappointing outcome; however, the termination of the transaction has no impact on the Company's transformation strategy or our ability to execute," said Chief Executive Michael Bloom. The pharmacy and general merchandise chain's stock selloff puts it on track to open at the lowest level seen since Nov. 16, 2016. The stock had tumbled 34% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  had gained 9.0%.

Fred's adopts poison pill following increased 'volatility' in share price
Fred's Inc.  said Wednesday that it has adopted a short-term shareholder rights plan, also known as a "poison pill," which will expire on Sept. 25. The general merchandise and pharmacy retailer said it has adopted the plan as a result of "increased trading volatility" in its shares, and in anticipation of activity related to its associated asset purchase agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  and Rite Aid Corp. , pending those companies' merger. The plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that an entity would gain control of the company. "It was not adopted in response to any specific takeover bid or other proposal to acquire control of the company," Fred's said in a statement. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, had lost 4.3% on Tuesday after soaring 23% on Monday. It has plunged 35% year to date, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has lost 8.7% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.1%.

Fred's June sales decline more than expected
Fred's Inc.  said Thursday that June sales were lower than expected, and are expected to hurt fiscal second-quarter results to the point that the drug store chain no longer expects improvement from the sequential first quarter. Total sales for the month fell 5.3% from a year ago to $197.5 million, while same-store sales declined 1.6%. company said combined pharmacy same-store sales increased 3.5%, but front store sales continued to face headwinds in consumer consumables categories, and with cooler than average temperatures hurting summer seasonal sales. "Our lower than anticipated June sales and the headwinds we are facing will impact our second quarter results, and we no longer expect sequential improvement from the first quarter," said Chief Executive Michael Bloom. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has plunged 60% year to date through Wednesday, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has lost 8.5% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Walgreens terminates Rite Aid merger, replaces with agreement to buy 2,186 stores
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  said Thursday that it has terminated its merger agreement with Rite Aid Corp.  and has instead agreed to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets. The consideration for the deal will be $5.175 billion in cash and the option for Rite Aid to become a member of the Walgreens group purchasing organization, an option that can be exercised through May 2019 and is subject to certain conditions. This new agreement replaces the merger agreement announced October 2015 and amended January 2017, along with the agreement to divest some Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc. , which was announced in December 2016. The agreement with Fred's has also been terminated and Walgreens will pay a $325 million termination fee. After the new transaction is approved, Walgreens will acquire the Rite Aid stores and assets over about six months and will eventually convert them to the Walgreens brand. Walgreens expects the transaction to be "modestly accretive" to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the initial closing, and expects synergies totaling $400 million that will be fully realized within three to four years. Walgreens shares are up 1.7% in premarket trading, Rite Aid shares are down 6.1%, and Fred's shares are down 27%. Walgreens shares are down nearly 7% for the year so far while Rite Aid shares are down more than 52% and Fred's are down 33.6% for the period. The S&P 500 index  is up 9% for 2017 to date.

Fred's stock plunges after deal to buy some Rite Aid stores was terminated
Shares of Fred's Inc.  plunged 27% in premarket trade Thursday, after the agreement to buy 865 Rite Aid Corp.  was terminated. The agreement was originally announced on Dec. 20, 2016. The termination comes after Rite Aid agreed to sell 2,186 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. , which also terminates the companies' merger agreement. Fred's said it will receive a $25 million termination fee. "This is a disappointing outcome; however, the termination of the transaction has no impact on the Company's transformation strategy or our ability to execute," said Chief Executive Michael Bloom. The pharmacy and general merchandise chain's stock selloff puts it on track to open at the lowest level seen since Nov. 16, 2016. The stock had tumbled 34% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  had gained 9.0%.

Fred's adopts poison pill following increased 'volatility' in share price
Fred's Inc.  said Wednesday that it has adopted a short-term shareholder rights plan, also known as a "poison pill," which will expire on Sept. 25. The general merchandise and pharmacy retailer said it has adopted the plan as a result of "increased trading volatility" in its shares, and in anticipation of activity related to its associated asset purchase agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  and Rite Aid Corp. , pending those companies' merger. The plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that an entity would gain control of the company. "It was not adopted in response to any specific takeover bid or other proposal to acquire control of the company," Fred's said in a statement. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, had lost 4.3% on Tuesday after soaring 23% on Monday. It has plunged 35% year to date, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has lost 8.7% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.1%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FRED'S, INC. Revenue and Financial Data

   Those whose greenbacks feature George and Abe rather than Andrew and Ulysses may very well shop at Fred's. Generally serving customers with modest or fixed incomes, Fred's operates more than 650 discount stores in some 15 states, primarily in small- to medium-sized towns in the Southeast. The stores carry more than 12,000 brand-name, off-brand, and private-label products, including pharmaceuticals, household goods, clothing and linens, food and tobacco items, health and beauty aids, and paper and cleaning supplies. Nearly 60% of its stores have full-service pharmacies. The company also provides goods and services to some 20 franchised Fred's stores. Founded in 1947, Fred's is exploring strategic alternatives. In late 2016 the retailer agreed to acquire 865 Rite Aid stores for $950 million in cash.

Termination of asset purchase agreement with Walgreens and Rite Aidhas no impact on Fred’s Pharmacy’s transformation
Strong team and right strategy in place to drive long-term
      shareholder value
MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 29, 2017--
      Fred’s, Inc. (“Fred’s Pharmacy” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:FRED) today
      commented on the termination of the merger between Walgreens Boots
      Alliance, Inc. (“Walgreens”) (NASDAQ: WBA) and Rite Aid Corporation
      (“Rite Aid”) (NYSE: RAD) and the related asset purchase agreement of
      Fred’s with Walgreens and Rite Aid.
    
Michael K. Bloom, Chief Executive Officer, said, “While the acquisition
      of additional stores was an opportunity for growth, we always viewed it
      as a potential outcome that would accelerate our transformation, not
      define it. This is a disappointing outcome; however, the termination of
      the transaction has no impact on the Company’s transformation strategy
      or our ability to execute. We are as confident as ever that we have a
      strong team and the right strategy in place to drive long-term growth
      and profitability, and to enhance value for our shareholders. We are
      excited about what we have accomplished and are optimistic about the
      future.”
    

      Mr. Bloom continued, “Our leadership team continues to deliver on its
      promise to optimize our business model and execute our healthcare
      strategy. We are capitalizing on opportunities to increase prescription
      comps in Retail Pharmacy, growing sales in Specialty Pharmacy and
      driving traffic into our front store. We also continue to optimize our
      store fleet, upgrade our talent, technology, supply chain and business
      processes. Our transformation is on track.”
    

      On December 20, 2016, Fred’s Pharmacy announced that it signed an asset
      purchase agreement with Walgreens and Rite Aid to purchase 865 stores
      and certain other assets. Completion of the transaction was subject to
      approval by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as other customary
      regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Following the termination
      of the merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid, the Fred’s Pharmacy asset
      purchase agreement with Walgreens and Rite Aid has also been terminated.
      Fred’s Pharmacy will receive $25 million as reimbursement for expenses
      associated with the terminated transaction.
