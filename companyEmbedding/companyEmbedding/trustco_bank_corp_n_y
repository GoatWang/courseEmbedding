(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-looking Statements  In addition to factors described under Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, if any, and under the Risk Factor discussion in TrustCo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, the following important factors, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect TrustCo's actual results and could cause TrustCo's actual financial performance to differ materially from that expressed in any forward-looking statement:  � TrustCo's ability to continue to originate a significant volume of one- to- four family mortgage loans in its market areas and to otherwise maintain or increase its market share in the areas in which it operates;  � TrustCo's ability to continue to maintain noninterest expense and other overhead costs at reasonable levels relative to income;  � TrustCo's ability to comply with the Formal Agreement entered into with Trustco Bank's regulator, the OCC, and potential regulatory actions if TrustCo or Trustco Bank fails to comply;  � restrictions or conditions imposed by TrustCo's and Trustco Bank's regulators on their operations that may make it more difficult to achieve TrustCo's and Trustco Bank's goals;  � the future earnings and capital levels of TrustCo and Trustco Bank and the continued receipt of approvals from TrustCo's and Trustco Bank's primary federal banking regulators under regulatory rules and the Formal Agreement to distribute capital from Trustco Bank to TrustCo, which could affect the ability of TrustCo to pay;  � the results of supervisory monitoring or examinations of Trustco Bank and the Company by their respective primary federal banking regulators, including the possibility that the regulators may, among other things, require us to increase our loss allowances or to take other actions that reduce capital or income;  Index  � the effects of and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, inflation, interest rates, market and monetary fluctuations;  � adverse conditions in the securities markets that lead to impairment in the value of securities in TrustCo's investment portfolio;  � changes in law and policy accompanying the new presidential administration and uncertainty or speculation pending the enactment of such changes;  � the perceived overall value of TrustCo's products and services by users, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors' products and services and the willingness of current and prospective customers to substitute competitors' products and services for TrustCo's products and services;  � changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;  � the effect of changes in financial services laws and regulations (including laws concerning taxation, banking and securities) and the impact of other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new regulatory capital requirements that took effect for 2016;  � changes in management personnel;  � real estate and collateral values;  � changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;  � disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events affecting the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions;  � technological changes and electronic, cyber and physical security breaches;  � changes in local market areas and general business and economic trends, as well as changes in consumer spending and saving habits;  � TrustCo's success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing and managing its business; and  � other risks and uncertainties included under "Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although TrustCo believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. The foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive, and the Company disclaims any obligation to subsequently revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.  Following this discussion are the tables "Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity: Interest Rates and Interest Differential" which gives a detailed breakdown of TrustCo's average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Index  During the first quarter of 2017 financial markets were influenced by both underlying economic conditions and by political developments, in particular expectations arising from initiatives expected to be pursued by the Trump administration. Equity markets ended the first quarter up, with most of the gain coming early in the quarter. For the full first quarter, the S&P 500 Index was up 5.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.6%. Credit markets continue to be driven by worldwide economic news and decreasing liquidity in some segments of the bond market. The shape of the yield curve continued to flatten during the quarter, with average yields declining for the first quarter as compared to the second quarter. The 10-year Treasury bond averaged 2.45% during Q1 compared to 2.14% in Q4, an increase of 31 basis points. The 2-year Treasury bond average rate increased 23 basis points to 1.24%, resulting in a modest steepening of the curve. The spread between the 10-year and the 2-year Treasury bonds increased from 1.13% on average in Q4 to 1.20% in Q1. This spread had been declining over most of the last three years. Even with the modest improvement in Q1, the spread remains at only half of the 2.42% level averaged during its most recent peak in Q4 of 2013. Steeper yield curves are favorable for portfolio mortgage lenders like TrustCo. The table below illustrates the range of rate movements for both short term and longer term rates. The target Fed Funds range was increased by 25 basis points on March 15, 2017 to a range of 0.75% to 1.00%. This increase follows a similar 25 basis point increase announced on December 14, 2016. Spreads of most asset classes, including agency securities, corporates, municipals and mortgage-backed securities, were flat to down by the end of the quarter as compared to the levels seen at the end of 2016. Changes in rates and spreads during the current quarter were due to a number of factors; however, uncertainty about the timing of any actions that the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB") would take in regard to the extraordinary accommodations that have influenced markets in recent years and further uncertainty regarding the economy and related issues were key factors. Low risk free rates in major nations have also caused investors to shift into alternative fixed income instruments, contributing to the compression of spreads over the risk free rate.

Employment metrics have generally improved, but remain inconsistent and not particularly robust. Economic conditions vary significantly over geographic areas, with strength concentrated in and around major population centers on the coasts and in certain areas where economic activity has been driven by specific regional factors. The unprecedented intervention by governments in markets and attempts to stimulate the economy, including the sharp easing of monetary policy during 2007-2008, will eventually be reversed. How the Federal Reserve resolves its own balance sheet expansion has become an increasing focus of economists and market participants. Economic activity in Europe, China and elsewhere has also improved in some aspects, but remains mixed. Finally, regulatory changes that have been enacted are expected to continue to impact the banking industry going forward. These regulatory changes have added significant operating expense and operational burden and have fundamentally changed the way banks conduct business. The new presidential administration has set policy initiatives that include attempts to reduce the regulatory burden; the timing and extent of any success on that front is yet to be determined. Fiscal policy initiatives, particularly a plan to significantly reduce corporate tax rates could have a major impact on the economy and on TrustCo, but there is no certainty that those initiatives will take effect at all or will result in any timely and/or significant change.  Index  Overview  The primary factors accounting for the change in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period of the prior year were:  � An increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of $149.3 million to $4.78 billion for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.  � An increase in taxable equivalent net interest margin for the first quarter of 2017 to 3.14% from 3.13% in the prior year period. The increase in the margin, coupled with the increase in average earning assets, resulted in an increase of $1.2 million in taxable equivalent net interest income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.  � An increase of $1.2 million in salaries and benefits expense for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.  � A decrease of $943 thousand in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and other insurance expense for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.  � A decrease of $218 thousand in Professional Services expense for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to increased staffing and benefits costs.  Index  � An increase of $455 thousand in income taxes in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings.  Regulatory Agreement  The Agreement relates to the findings of the OCC following its regularly scheduled examination of the Bank in January 2015. Since the completion of the examination and entry into the Agreement, the Bank believes it has been working diligently to address the findings of the examination and to develop and implement appropriate formal action plans.  The Agreement requires the Bank to take various actions, within prescribed time frames, with respect to certain activities of the Bank. These include, among others, (i) establishment of a committee of at least three Directors to monitor and coordinate the Bank's response to the Formal Agreement; (ii) adoption of compliance plans to respond to the Formal Agreement with the assistance of an independent qualified consultant; (iii) evaluation and implementation of improvements in corporate governance with the assistance of an independent qualified consultant; (iv) evaluation and implementation of improvements in internal audit; (v) development of a strategic plan; (vi) development of a revised capital plan, including dividends, consistent with the strategic plan;  Asset/Liability Management  TrustCo's results are affected by a variety of factors including competitive and economic conditions in the specific markets in which the Company operates and, more generally, in the national economy, financial market conditions and the regulatory environment. Each of these factors is dynamic, and changes in any area can have an impact on TrustCo's results. Included in the Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 is a description of the effect interest rates had on the results for the year 2016 compared to 2015. Many of the same market factors discussed in the 2016 Annual Report continued to have a significant impact on results through the first quarter of 2017.  Index  Interest rates have a significant impact on the operations and financial results of all financial services companies. One of the most important interest rates used to implement national economic policy is the Federal Funds rate. This is the interest rate utilized within the banking system for overnight borrowings for institutions with the highest credit rating. The Federal Funds target rate decreased from 4.25% at the beginning of 2008 to a target range of 0.00% to 0.25% by the end of 2008. In December 2015, the target increased to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%, and 25 basis point increases in the target range were also announced in December of 2016 and March of 2017, producing the current range of 0.75% to 1.00%. While FRB officials have pointed repeatedly to additional increases in 2017, the comments have not been completely consistent or clear in regard to expectations; any increases are likely to be supported only if economic conditions continue to improve. In the March statement from the Federal Open Market Committee, it was noted that, "In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data."  Traditionally, interest rates on bank deposit accounts are heavily influenced by the Federal Funds rate. The average rate on interest bearing deposits was 4 basis points lower in the first quarter of 2017 relative to the prior year period. Rates were flat or lower on all deposit categories as compared to the same period in 2016. Please refer to the statistical disclosures in the table below entitled "Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity:  The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury bond and other long-term interest rates have significant influence on the rates for new residential real estate loans. The FRB has attempted to influence rates on mortgage loans by means other than targeting a lower Federal Funds rate, including direct intervention in the mortgage-backed securities market through purchasing these securities in an attempt to raise prices and reduce yields. In recent periods this includes the reinvestment of principal payments received on its holdings of agency securities, agency mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities. While no longer increasing its holdings of these securities, the reinvestment of principal means that the existing holdings are not being unwound. Eventually, management believes, the FRB will have to unwind these positions, which would likely put upward pressure on rates, although other factors may mitigate this pressure. These changes in interest rates can have an effect on the Company relative to the interest income on loans, securities and Federal Funds sold and other short term instruments, as well as on interest expense on deposits and borrowings.  Index  Interest rates on new residential real estate loan originations are also influenced by the rates established by secondary market participants such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. As a portfolio lender, TrustCo does not sell loans into the secondary market in the normal course of business and is able to establish rates that management determines are appropriate in light of the long-term nature of residential real estate loans while remaining competitive with the secondary market rates. Financial market volatility and the problems faced by the financial services industry have lessened the influence of the secondary market; however, various programs initiated by arms of the federal government have had an impact on rate levels for certain products. Most importantly, a government goal of keeping mortgage rates low has been supported by targeted buying of certain securities, thus supporting prices and constraining yields, as noted above. Very low interest rates in many markets around the world have also increased demand for US fixed income assets, which has also contributed to the decline of rates on these assets.  The Federal Funds sold and other short term investments portfolios are affected primarily by changes in the Federal Funds target rate. Also, changes in interest rates have an effect on the recorded balance of the securities available for sale portfolio, which is recorded at fair value. Generally, as interest rates increase the fair value of these securities will decrease.  Interest rates generally remained below historic norms on both short term and longer term investments during the first quarter of 2017 despite the increases seen during the quarter.  While TrustCo has been affected by aspects of the overall changes in financial markets, it was not affected to the degree the mortgage crisis affected some banks and financial institutions in the United States beginning in 2007. Generally, the crisis revolved around actual and future levels of delinquencies and defaults on mortgage loans, in many cases arising, in management's view, from lenders with overly liberal underwriting standards, changes in the types of mortgage loans offered, significant upward resets on adjustable rate loans and fraud, among other factors. The Company utilizes a traditional underwriting process in evaluating loan applications, and since originated loans are retained in the portfolio, there is a strong incentive to be conservative in making credit decisions. For additional information concerning TrustCo's loan portfolio and nonperforming loans, please refer to the discussions under "Loans" and "Nonperforming Assets," respectively. Further, the Company does not rely on borrowed funds to support its assets and maintains a significant level of . . .  May 05, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

History[edit]
Purchase of Schenectady Bank and General Electric[edit]
On February 17, 1902, the first trust company was chartered in Schenectady, formed through the purchase of the assets of the Schenectady Bank (c. 1832). As the credit union for General Electric Corporation (GE), Schenectady Trust Company opened for business on June 9, 1902 with 11 employees, and initial deposits of $762,578.11[citation needed]. The original buildings resided at 320 and 318 State Street in downtown Schenectady, New York. Charles P. Steinmetz (the “Electrical Wizard”) of General Electric and Union College fame was a major depositor and Samuel M. Hamill of General Electric became the first President of the Schenectady Trust Company. Total deposits at the end of the bank’s first year were over $1.5 million.
Schenectady Trust Company[edit]
By 1912, business in Schenectady, especially GE, was booming. As many new businesses emerged at a rapid rate, many of them received their earliest financing from Schenectady Trust Company. In 1919 Schenectady Trust Company built the current structure that is now known as the Main Trustco Bank branch office at 320 State Street. Gerardus Smith was President of the Bank at the close of 1912, and total assets were $4.5 million.
The Roaring Twenties[edit]
The Mont Pleasant branch office opened in 1924. In 1925, Proctor’s Theatre, Erie Boulevard and the Western Gateway Bridge opened more culture, tourism and commerce to Schenectady. The third branch, the Brandywine office, was opened in 1928. In the late twenties Schenectady’s building boom took place and Schenectady Trust provided mortgage loans. At the close of 1922, H.B. Boardman was President of the Bank, and total assets were $12.1 million.
The Depression and World War II[edit]
Even though the thirties saw the economy come to a virtual standstill, Schenectady Trust continued to pay out dividends to shareholders, making a consistent record of paying dividends since 1904. At the end of 1932, H.B. Boardman was still President of the Bank, and total assets were $16.7 million. The forties threw the nation into World War II, Schenectady Trust put plans in motion to provide direct auto financing for the increasing mobile population. By 1946, the Union Street Branch was open. At the end of 1942, Edward T. Rice was Chairman of the Board and Laurence G. Magner was President of the Bank; total assets were $34.9 million. In 1947, Schenectady Trust acquired Union National Bank, which opened in 1891. Modernization of the Main Branch and State Street Branch began.
Post War Era[edit]
In response to the 1954 opening of the New York State Thruway, Schenectady Trust expanded with branches into the suburbs to accommodate the growing population. By 1956, the Mayfair Branch office in Glenville and the Sheridan Plaza Branch office were opened. The Union Street Branch office was moved into its present location during the fifties. Ralph H. Rue was President of the bank at the end of 1952 and total assets were $74.2 million.
1960s[edit]
Though the local Schenectady economy began the decade with a slowdown, employment ended on an upswing at Schenectady Trust as they continued to grow with the community. Four more Branch offices were opened during the time: Rotterdam in 1965, the Trust Division in March 1968 and in June, 1968 Clifton Park and Plaza Seven were opened. In 1965, the financial computer center of Eastern New York was organized as a joint electronic data processing center by Schenectady Trust and eight other area banks. At the end of 1962, Ralph H. Rue was still President of the Bank, and total assets were $100.2 million.
1970s[edit]
In spite of inflation, the seventies showed growth in the Schenectady area—that growth was reflected in the Bank’s services and prompted additional Branch office openings. New services were introduced during this period: Personal Line of Credit, Statement Savings and Bank Americard (now VISA). Along with the new services, new Branches were opened in Niskayuna, Colonie and Guilderland. In 1973 the Main Branch interior was again enlarged and renovated, and the lot at the rear of the bank (former location of Redmond gas station) was purchased for parking and allowed access to Erie Boulevard. Toward the very end of the seventies, additional properties on Erie Boulevard were purchased that would later become the Trust Operations Building. At the end of 1972, H. Gladstone McKeon was President of the Bank and total assets were $151 million.
1980s and Formation of TrustCo Bank Corp NY[edit]
The bank continued to expand in the 80s as they now extended to the entire Capital Region. In July 1982, TrustCo Bank Corp NY was formed and a new Operations Center opened on Erie Boulevard in 1982 to handle the acquisition of seven Bank of New York offices, which occurred in January 1984. Schenectady Trust Company was renamed Trustco Bank New York in January 1989.
By the end of 1982, Harry E. Whittingham, Jr. was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert A. McCormick was President and Chief Operation Officer of the Bank. Total assets were $301.4 million, net income was $2.9 million and market capitalization was $17 million.
Acquisition of Home & City Savings Bank[edit]
Trustco acquired Home & City Savings Bank and a three-story expansion of the Erie Boulevard Trust Operations Building in 1991. In May 1992, Trustco Bank sponsored and hosted a Block party on Erie Boulevard to celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the Bank and its $2.1 billion in assets by the end of 1995. The nineties also saw new Branch openings in Glens Falls, Queensbury, Wilton Mall and Clifton Park—which along with the former Home & City offices brought the total Branch locations to 53 throughout the Capital Region by the end of the decade. At the end of 1992, Robert A. McCormick was President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, total assets were $1.9 billion, net income was $17.5 million and market capitalization was $222 million.
2000s[edit]
In July 2000 Trustco acquired a Savings Bank Charter and subsequently acquired Landmark Financial Corp. and its subsidiary, Landmark Community Bank, which was completed on July 28, 2000. Further expansion was made possible by an accompanying federal thrift charter. The Trustco Bank corporate headquarters relocated to Trustco Center in Glenville during 2001. The total number of Branch offices tops out at 60, with plans to expand downstate and into Florida. As of December 31, 2001 total assets were $2.6 billion, net income was $45.5 million and market capitalization was $896 million. Robert A. McCormick, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, celebrated 25 years with the Bank in January 2002, 17 of those years serving as CEO. Despite a poor economy and bank bailouts, Trustco expanded into Downstate New York as well as into Florida between 2002 and 2009 (36 in Central Florida and five in other areas of the state). Two Branch openings occurred in the first quarter of 2010 in Sun City Center and Lady Lake, Florida. By March 2010, Trustco Bank had 134 branch locations in five states (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Vermont and Florida).
Community involvements[edit]
As Trustco opens additional branches in new markets, they host grand opening events, as well as become a “Home Town Bank” by participating in and sponsoring local and community-centric events. Trustco Bank is a sponsor of the annual celebration, Red, Hot & Boom, a July Fourth celebration at Crane’s Roost Park in the Uptown Altamonte area of Altamonte Springs, Florida. Florida Collegiate Summer League, a wood bat baseball league with five teams in Central Florida, is a recipient of a seasonal Trustco Bank sponsorship. Further, Holiday in the Park at Lake Eola in Downtown Orlando is an annual sponsorship event that Trustco participated in December 2008 and 2009. In New York, Trustco has sponsored the Clifton Park 4 July Parade that runs all the way from the Shenendehowa High School campus to Clifton Common. Giving back to their Schenectady roots, Truscto Bank also sponsors the Tri-City ValleyCats, a minor league baseball team named after the Tri-Cities - Troy, Albany and Schenectady - that make up New York state's Capital District.
Green initiatives[edit]
Trustco has incorporated green initiatives into its service offerings with online banking capabilities, as well as the marketing and promotions materials. In the spring of 2009, Trustco Bank sent out postcards on actual “seed paper,” encouraging deposits from new customers as well as put the wild-flower-growing mailer in the ground. Additionally, Trustco Bank created promotions centered on several local supermarkets and offered recyclable/reusable shopping totes and $50 gift cards, to keep the money and other natural resources, in the local community.
Awards and accolades[edit]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

It also accepts demand, savings, checking accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit from customers.

Recently, Trustco has added “eStatements,” an electronic version of the monthly statement with images available online and Free Online Banking via the Trustco Bank Internet site.

History[edit]
Purchase of Schenectady Bank and General Electric[edit]
On February 17, 1902, the first trust company was chartered in Schenectady, formed through the purchase of the assets of the Schenectady Bank (c. 1832). As the credit union for General Electric Corporation (GE), Schenectady Trust Company opened for business on June 9, 1902 with 11 employees, and initial deposits of $762,578.11[citation needed]. The original buildings resided at 320 and 318 State Street in downtown Schenectady, New York. Charles P. Steinmetz (the “Electrical Wizard”) of General Electric and Union College fame was a major depositor and Samuel M. Hamill of General Electric became the first President of the Schenectady Trust Company. Total deposits at the end of the bank’s first year were over $1.5 million.
Schenectady Trust Company[edit]
By 1912, business in Schenectady, especially GE, was booming. As many new businesses emerged at a rapid rate, many of them received their earliest financing from Schenectady Trust Company. In 1919 Schenectady Trust Company built the current structure that is now known as the Main Trustco Bank branch office at 320 State Street. Gerardus Smith was President of the Bank at the close of 1912, and total assets were $4.5 million.
The Roaring Twenties[edit]
The Mont Pleasant branch office opened in 1924. In 1925, Proctor’s Theatre, Erie Boulevard and the Western Gateway Bridge opened more culture, tourism and commerce to Schenectady. The third branch, the Brandywine office, was opened in 1928. In the late twenties Schenectady’s building boom took place and Schenectady Trust provided mortgage loans. At the close of 1922, H.B. Boardman was President of the Bank, and total assets were $12.1 million.
The Depression and World War II[edit]
Even though the thirties saw the economy come to a virtual standstill, Schenectady Trust continued to pay out dividends to shareholders, making a consistent record of paying dividends since 1904. At the end of 1932, H.B. Boardman was still President of the Bank, and total assets were $16.7 million. The forties threw the nation into World War II, Schenectady Trust put plans in motion to provide direct auto financing for the increasing mobile population. By 1946, the Union Street Branch was open. At the end of 1942, Edward T. Rice was Chairman of the Board and Laurence G. Magner was President of the Bank; total assets were $34.9 million. In 1947, Schenectady Trust acquired Union National Bank, which opened in 1891. Modernization of the Main Branch and State Street Branch began.
Post War Era[edit]
In response to the 1954 opening of the New York State Thruway, Schenectady Trust expanded with branches into the suburbs to accommodate the growing population. By 1956, the Mayfair Branch office in Glenville and the Sheridan Plaza Branch office were opened. The Union Street Branch office was moved into its present location during the fifties. Ralph H. Rue was President of the bank at the end of 1952 and total assets were $74.2 million.
1960s[edit]
Though the local Schenectady economy began the decade with a slowdown, employment ended on an upswing at Schenectady Trust as they continued to grow with the community. Four more Branch offices were opened during the time: Rotterdam in 1965, the Trust Division in March 1968 and in June, 1968 Clifton Park and Plaza Seven were opened. In 1965, the financial computer center of Eastern New York was organized as a joint electronic data processing center by Schenectady Trust and eight other area banks. At the end of 1962, Ralph H. Rue was still President of the Bank, and total assets were $100.2 million.
1970s[edit]
In spite of inflation, the seventies showed growth in the Schenectady area—that growth was reflected in the Bank’s services and prompted additional Branch office openings. New services were introduced during this period: Personal Line of Credit, Statement Savings and Bank Americard (now VISA). Along with the new services, new Branches were opened in Niskayuna, Colonie and Guilderland. In 1973 the Main Branch interior was again enlarged and renovated, and the lot at the rear of the bank (former location of Redmond gas station) was purchased for parking and allowed access to Erie Boulevard. Toward the very end of the seventies, additional properties on Erie Boulevard were purchased that would later become the Trust Operations Building. At the end of 1972, H. Gladstone McKeon was President of the Bank and total assets were $151 million.
1980s and Formation of TrustCo Bank Corp NY[edit]
The bank continued to expand in the 80s as they now extended to the entire Capital Region. In July 1982, TrustCo Bank Corp NY was formed and a new Operations Center opened on Erie Boulevard in 1982 to handle the acquisition of seven Bank of New York offices, which occurred in January 1984. Schenectady Trust Company was renamed Trustco Bank New York in January 1989.
By the end of 1982, Harry E. Whittingham, Jr. was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert A. McCormick was President and Chief Operation Officer of the Bank. Total assets were $301.4 million, net income was $2.9 million and market capitalization was $17 million.
Acquisition of Home & City Savings Bank[edit]
Trustco acquired Home & City Savings Bank and a three-story expansion of the Erie Boulevard Trust Operations Building in 1991. In May 1992, Trustco Bank sponsored and hosted a Block party on Erie Boulevard to celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the Bank and its $2.1 billion in assets by the end of 1995. The nineties also saw new Branch openings in Glens Falls, Queensbury, Wilton Mall and Clifton Park—which along with the former Home & City offices brought the total Branch locations to 53 throughout the Capital Region by the end of the decade. At the end of 1992, Robert A. McCormick was President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, total assets were $1.9 billion, net income was $17.5 million and market capitalization was $222 million.
2000s[edit]
In July 2000 Trustco acquired a Savings Bank Charter and subsequently acquired Landmark Financial Corp. and its subsidiary, Landmark Community Bank, which was completed on July 28, 2000. Further expansion was made possible by an accompanying federal thrift charter. The Trustco Bank corporate headquarters relocated to Trustco Center in Glenville during 2001. The total number of Branch offices tops out at 60, with plans to expand downstate and into Florida. As of December 31, 2001 total assets were $2.6 billion, net income was $45.5 million and market capitalization was $896 million. Robert A. McCormick, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, celebrated 25 years with the Bank in January 2002, 17 of those years serving as CEO. Despite a poor economy and bank bailouts, Trustco expanded into Downstate New York as well as into Florida between 2002 and 2009 (36 in Central Florida and five in other areas of the state). Two Branch openings occurred in the first quarter of 2010 in Sun City Center and Lady Lake, Florida. By March 2010, Trustco Bank had 134 branch locations in five states (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Vermont and Florida).
Community involvements[edit]
As Trustco opens additional branches in new markets, they host grand opening events, as well as become a “Home Town Bank” by participating in and sponsoring local and community-centric events. Trustco Bank is a sponsor of the annual celebration, Red, Hot & Boom, a July Fourth celebration at Crane’s Roost Park in the Uptown Altamonte area of Altamonte Springs, Florida. Florida Collegiate Summer League, a wood bat baseball league with five teams in Central Florida, is a recipient of a seasonal Trustco Bank sponsorship. Further, Holiday in the Park at Lake Eola in Downtown Orlando is an annual sponsorship event that Trustco participated in December 2008 and 2009. In New York, Trustco has sponsored the Clifton Park 4 July Parade that runs all the way from the Shenendehowa High School campus to Clifton Common. Giving back to their Schenectady roots, Truscto Bank also sponsors the Tri-City ValleyCats, a minor league baseball team named after the Tri-Cities - Troy, Albany and Schenectady - that make up New York state's Capital District.
Green initiatives[edit]
Trustco has incorporated green initiatives into its service offerings with online banking capabilities, as well as the marketing and promotions materials. In the spring of 2009, Trustco Bank sent out postcards on actual “seed paper,” encouraging deposits from new customers as well as put the wild-flower-growing mailer in the ground. Additionally, Trustco Bank created promotions centered on several local supermarkets and offered recyclable/reusable shopping totes and $50 gift cards, to keep the money and other natural resources, in the local community.
Awards and accolades[edit]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

TrustCo Announces 17% Increase in Second Quarter 2017 Earnings
GLENVILLE, N.Y., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 
TrustCo Bank Corp NY (TrustCo) (NASDAQ:TRST) today announced second quarter of 2017 net income of $12.2 million compared to $10.5 million for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 17.0%. 
Summary
Robert J. McCormick, President and Chief Executive Officer noted, "We are pleased to be able to report a 17% increase in net income in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the second quarter of 2016.  Improved revenue growth and expense control combined to produce a solid quarter and an encouraging first half of 2017.  Our focus on traditional lending criteria and conservative balance sheet management has enabled us to produce consistent earnings, maintain strong liquidity and capital and allowed us to continue to grow our business and take advantage of changes in market and competitive conditions.  In terms of our core business, we continue to add customer relationships, which ultimately drive future growth.  We will continue to take advantage of opportunities as they are presented during the balance of 2017 and beyond." 
TrustCo saw continued solid loan growth in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year, led by an increase in residential mortgages.  Loan portfolio expansion was funded by a combination of utilizing a portion of our strong cash balances and by the growth of our deposit base.  The continued shift toward loans helped offset the margin impact from continued comparatively low yields on cash and investments.  Recent decisions by the Federal Reserve to raise short term interest rates have contributed to our results and will provide a further benefit in the second half of 2017 and beyond.  The growth in average deposits in the second quarter of 2017 versus the prior year was led by lower cost checking and savings deposits.  TrustCo's strong liquidity position continues to allow it to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Asset quality measures improved versus June 30, 2016, with nonperforming assets (NPAs) declining $4.7 million.
Details
Average loans were up $150.1 million or 4.5% in the second quarter of 2017 over the same period in 2016. Average residential loans, our primary lending focus, were up $200.0 million or 7.2% in the second quarter of 2017, over the same period in 2016.  Overall loan growth was constrained by a $15.6 million decline in average commercial loans, which have become less attractive on a risk adjusted basis, and a $34.0 million decline in average outstandings on home equity lines of credit, as well as a small decline in installment loans. Average deposits were up $36.0 million or 0.9% for the second quarter of 2017 over the same period a year earlier.  The increase in deposits came from core deposit accounts, which consist of checking, savings and money market deposits, with checking and savings entirely responsible for the growth within core deposits.  Average core deposits increased $110.3 million from the second quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017, while average time deposit balances were down.  Within core, money market balances were down $2.6 million, while checking was up $100.2 million (including interest bearing and non-interest bearing balances) and savings were up $12.7 million.  Core deposits typically represent longer term customer relationships and are generally lower cost than time deposits.  The cost of interest bearing deposits declined from 0.38% in the second quarter of 2016 to 0.34% in the second quarter of 2017.  The shift out of money market balances was also beneficial, as that category is the most expensive type of core deposit.  Mr. McCormick noted that, "The year-over-year growth of our loans and core deposit base reflect the long term strategic focus of the Company."
For the second quarter of 2017, return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.00% and 11.05%, respectively, compared to 0.88% and 9.88% for the second quarter of 2016.  Diluted earnings per share were $0.127 for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $0.109 for the second quarter of 2016.  As previously discussed, some operating costs remain at elevated levels in response to regulatory requirements, however overall expense control remains a key area of focus.  Total operating expenses declined by $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the second quarter of 2016, led by lower deposit insurance, ORE costs and equipment expense.  The decline in expenses coupled with $1.5 million of revenue growth over the same period resulted in the bottom line improvement noted.  We anticipate being able to control expense growth effectively in the second half of 2017.  Some of the costs associated with regulatory issues will be recurring, but others will diminish over time.
"While some banks have backed away from branches, a customer-friendly branch franchise continues to be the key to our long term plans.  We continue to make good progress expanding loans and deposits throughout our entire branch network.  We expect that trend to continue as the newer branches continue to mature."
"At June 30, 2017, our average deposits per branch were $29.2 million, compared to $28.8 million a year earlier.  We have always designed our branches to be smaller and more cost effective than those built by many of our competitors.  We use open floor plans that help maximize the value of our branches.  We remain mindful that fully achieving our goals for newer branches will take time and continued work.  We believe success in growing customer relationships provides basic building blocks that will help drive profit growth for the coming years."
Asset quality and loan loss reserve measures improved versus June 30, 2016.  Nonperforming loans (NPLs) were $24.5 million at June 30, 2017, compared to $28.2 million at June 30, 2016.  NPLs were equal to 0.70% of total loans at June 30, 2017, compared to 0.84% at June 30, 2016.  The coverage ratio, or allowance for loan losses to NPLs, was 180.0% at June 30, 2017, compared to 156.0% at June 30, 2016.  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) were $28.1 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $32.8 million at June 30, 2016.  The ratio of loan loss allowance to total loans was 1.26% as of June 30, 2017, compared to 1.32% at June 30, 2016 and reflects both the improvement in asset quality and economic conditions in our lending areas.  The allowance for loan losses was $44.2 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $44.1 million at June 30, 2016.  The provision for loan losses was $550 thousand for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $800 thousand in the second quarter of 2016.  Net chargeoffs for the second quarter of 2017 decreased versus the second quarter of 2016, falling to $436 thousand from $1.1 million in the year earlier period.  The annualized net chargeoff ratio was 0.05% for the second quarter of 2017, compared to 0.14% in the second quarter of 2016, remaining at the lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. 
The net interest margin for the second quarter of 2017 was 3.21%, up twelve basis points versus the second quarter of 2016, as increases in short term interest rates led to significantly higher earnings on cash, while slightly better returns were also achieved in the investment portfolio.  Loan yields did decline, but that was more than offset by higher volumes in terms of income.  During the same period, the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined, reflecting TrustCo's strong funding base.
For the first half of 2017, net income was $23.2 million, up 11.1% as compared to $20.9 million in the first half of 2016, or $0.241 and $0.219, respectively, per diluted share. 
At June 30, 2017 the equity to asset ratio was 9.09%, compared to 8.91% at June 30, 2016.  Book value per share at June 30, 2017 was $4.66 compared to $4.51 a year earlier.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation
Tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate tangible equity and tangible assets by excluding the balance of intangible assets from shareholders' equity and total assets, respectively. We calculate tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end by dividing tangible equity by tangible assets at period end. We believe that this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios. 
The efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure of expense control relative to revenue from net interest income and fee income.  We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing total noninterest expenses as determined under GAAP, but excluding other real estate expense, net, by net interest income (fully taxable equivalent) and total noninterest income as determined under GAAP, but excluding net gains on the sale of nonperforming loans and securities from this calculation.  We believe that this provides a reasonable measure of primary banking expenses relative to primary banking revenue. 
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our financial results. Our management internally assesses our performance based, in part, on these measures.  However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for these measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures of tangible common equity, tangible book value per share, efficiency ratio, net income and net income per share to the underlying GAAP numbers is set forth below.

We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio.

Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line.
