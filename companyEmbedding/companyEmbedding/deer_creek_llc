The Company You Keep








Closely held management services companies are nothing new. 
									Successful Hollywood actors have used personal services companies to manage expenses and minimize taxation for many years.
									 Landlords and limousine drivers use similar strategies, as do family trusts. 
									 At llctlc, we specialize in helping people like you create your own closely held Montana company, typically an LLC, to manage fixed and movable property. 
									 Using your Montana company to manage movable property like RVs and exotic cars can save you a small fortune and simplify record-keeping too. Your Montana LLCs pays no sales tax and can own vehicles (and airplanes), allowing you to drive your company's car. Find out more today.
									





Maximize Value for Your Stakeholders



Big companies maximize value for their shareholders by avoiding big tax bills. 
									Your stakeholders are you and your family members. You can formalize this relationship by creating a family LLC today with llctlc. 
									Use your family LLC to manage your movable property for maximum savings with a tax-free Montana LLC.
									 You may also be interested in a Wyoming LLC as a vehicle to protect other family assets. You can create your Montana LLC  online or call us at 877-913-5100 for a free consultation about our other other services, including creating Wyoming and New Mexico companies.

Annual LLC Renewal










Expedited Service
						







If you're ready to purchase a recreational vehicle, exotic car, or plane and need to form a Montana LLC fast, our expedited registered agent service is the fastest in the state.
									 We can walk to the Montana Secretary of State's offices or to the County Treasurer (while the Montana Motor Vehicles Division Title and Registration Bureau is responsible for MT vehicle registration, plates are obtained from the County Treasurer's office) from our downtown Helena, Montana office location. 
									 





One Low Flat Fee Regardless of Vehicle Value



Just say no to value-added county  taxes. Other registered agents may have to charge you up to 0.7 percent of a new vehicle's sticker price for a new vehicle registration. 
									We can  eliminate even this small fee by registering your Montana LLC RV or car in the lowest-priced county in Montana. RV full timers, car collectors, and airplane owners prefer Montana LLCs for managing movable property because Montana LLCs pay 0% sales tax and save them thousands of dollars. 
									Now you can save thousands more by registering your brand new motorhome or exotic car for just one low fee, regardless of the vehicle's actual purchase price. Just call 877-913-5100 and say flat fee!






llctlc is "A" rated by the Better Business Bureau.

No Montana Driver's License or Vehicle Inspection Required








You can easily create your Montana LLC and register your RV, collectible automobile, or trailer from the comfort of your own home. 
									While some of our clients prefer to obtain a Montana driver's license, neither vehicle inspections nor a Montana driver's license are required to register a vehicle with your Montana LLC. Call us at 877-913-5100 
									for more information or create your MT LLC online.





Bulletproof LLC Privacy Option



LLC member names and addresses are public records. 
									If you're concerned about litigants or other interested parties locating you through your LLC, rest easy: llctlc has three different privacy options to choose from. 
									Our new bulletproof privacy protection package keeps your name and the names of your shareholders entirely out of the public record.
									 Rest assured; you still control your assets: our custom corporate structure leaves you in the driver's seat, privately and anonymously, without the use of proxies. 
With llctlc's new bulletproof privacy package, you can simply say goodbye to nuisance suits and good riddance to "fishing letters". 
									Privacy and asset protection are closely linked. Our LLC privacy solution allows you to be virtually invisible without compromising control or ownership. 
									If you have concerns about the durability or permeability of your corporate veil, our bulletproof privacy package is the economical privacy solution you've been looking for. Call us today at 877-913-5100 
									for a free consultation and find out everything you need to know about all of our privacy packages.

Wyoming LLCs



With the help of llctlc, you can form your Limited Liability Company in New Mexico or
							 Wyoming as easily as you can create a Montana LLC.
							  Our customers choose Wyoming to conduct business in the state or for asset protection (while Montana is sales-tax free, Wyoming imposes no state income taxes). New Mexico, on the other hand, offers very strong LLC member privacy protection. 
							  The advantages of more than one state's LLC statutes can easily be combined. For example, you can use a New Mexico LLC to manage a Montana LLC, reaping the advantages of both. If you need more than a sales-tax free Montana LLC to manage moveable property, we're here to help. Call llctlc at 877-913-5100 
							  for a free consultation, use our live chat, or visit our contact page to get your questions answered.





The Montana Advantage



National registered agents and legal services firms can't compete with llctlc's Montana Registered Agent service because they have no physical presence in Montana. These companies use courier services and low–bid subcontractors, then pass the added costs on to you. A problem as simple as a misspelling on your LLC filing can swiftly become an insurmountable challenge when boiler room telephone support is combined with a strip mall legal office in another time zone. With llctlc as your Montana Registered Agent, you avoid the middlemen and deal directly with native Montanans in Montana's state capitol. Our customer service is second-to-none but don't just take our word for it: check out our written and video testimonials. 
Any questions? If you need more information about Montana LLCs or Montana vehicle registration, call us at 877-913-5100 for a free consultation, use our live chat, or visit our contact page.
 Get a Montana LLC today. You're only one step away from thousands in savings!










Montana LLC and Vehicle or Aircraft Registration Package Pricing


If you need more than a bare-bones Montana Limited Liability Company, you can save even more of your hard-earned money when you choose one of our LLC and vehicle or aircraft packages. We've bundled our most popular options, like privacy, bank accounts, and personal mail boxes into four discounted packages. Call us at 877-913-5100 or use our live chat to find out how much you can save with package pricing. 




llctlc is the World's First Wind-Powered Registered Agent


It's official: llctlc is now the first Registered Agent in the world to have all of its energy needs supplied by wind power. Dealing with llctlc isn't just a sound business decision; it's a sound environmental decision as well. You can even go a step further and support alternative energy development in Montana by purchasing the optional Alternative Energy Resources Organization (AERO) license plates that we sponsor when you register your vehicle in Montana.

Final Words



"Over and over again the courts have said that there is nothing
							sinister in so arranging one's affairs so as to keep taxes as low as
							possible. The rich do so, but they do wrong; for everybody owes a
							public duty to pay what is fair and equitable. Taxes are exactions for
							the general welfare; they should not be voluntary contributions for the
							rich and forced exactions for the poor. To demand less in the name of
							the people is to recant the values of democracy."
							—Judge Learned Hand (1947)
"Avoidance of tax is not a criminal offense. Taxpayers have the right to reduce, avoid, or minimize their taxes by legitimate means. One who avoids tax does not conceal or misrepresent, but shapes and preplans events to reduce or eliminate tax liability within the perimeters of the law."
							—Excerpt From IRS Fraud Handbook (retrieved 2/6/2012)
"Live long and prosper."
							—Mr. Spock (fictional television character)
