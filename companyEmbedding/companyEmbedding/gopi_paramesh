At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Suzanne Schmidt with Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.Suzanne SchmidtThank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining today's conference call. On the call with me today are Dr. Paramesh Gopi, President and CEO; and Marty McDermut, CFO.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that various remarks that we make on this call, including those about future financial results, including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, design wins, product plans, our competitive situation, market trends, statements about future development, production and adoption of X-Gene, X-Weave, HeliX, X-Tend, and other products and technologies, and our anticipated growth and profitability, all constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These forward-looking statements and all other statements that may be made on this call that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, in particular to the section entitled Risk Factors, and to other reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC for additional information on the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update them.I would like to point out that a number of the securities analysts that cover our stock use various financial measures, and this creates a range of variability relative to the Street financial models. When we say Street estimates, we mean the consensus of the major financial analyst models and they are not necessarily the guidance that was given by the Company.With that, I will now turn the call over to Paramesh.Paramesh GopiThank you for joining us today. We are very pleased with what we've accomplished this past quarter. We delivered solid financial results highlighted by our 7th sequential quarter of revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings of $0.02 per share. In fact, this marks our first quarter of profitability since the beginning of 2015.Let me start by reviewing key operating achievements from this past quarter and follow with important customer developments that illustrate the increasing traction we are seeing across our business. First, on the computer side. I would like to highlight that HP Enterprise, the industry's leading storage vendor announced the launch of their high volume enterprise storage using our X-Gene ARM-based processor solutions. Second, this was a milestone quarter for our connectivity business on multiple fronts; notably, the IEEE standards body recommended the adoption of Applied Micro single lambda 100 gigabit per second PAM4 Solution to be an industry standard for enterprise and datacenter connectivity. This is important because it positions Applied Micro's technology as a solution of choice for datacenter connectivity going forward.We expect an accelerated PAM4 adoption cycle given the move towards standardizing around our approach, and the clear value this technology brings to customers. Also on the connectivity front, we saw record shipments of our X-Gene OTM and five products across our Tier 1 customer base, an unprecedented demand for our industry leading Ethernet security products.Turning now to our computer business. HP Enterprise introduced the StoreVirtual 3200, the industry's 64-bit ARM-based high volume enterprise storage platform which is based on Applied Micro's X-Gene Technology. This platform targets large enterprise customers and their private clouds. HPE chose our X-Gene 64-bit server on a chip solution because it provides a powerful computing engine, multiple integrated 10-gigabit and 1-gigabit Ethernet networking port, and multiple PCIe Gen 3 lane for storage expansion; all in a single socket. X-Gene provided a clear and substantial cost savings for HPE when compared with existing x86 based platform solution. This latest collaboration with HPE underscores the continued penetration of X-Gene based platforms into enterprise areas that were once effectively controlled by x86 based chip.In addition during the quarter we successfully tapped out our next-generation X-Gene3 processor using TSMC 60 nanometer FinFET Technology. We are thrilled to share with you that X-Gene3 is expected to deliver six times the performance of currently flipping X-Gene product and is targeted to compete with mainstream high-end beyond E5 and E7 processors in a similar power. With eight DDR4 channels, X-Gene3 outclasses beyond E5 memory bandwidth, making it well suited to hyperscale workload such as in-memory computing, Big Data, and machine learning. X-Gene3 is built upon two generations of industry hardened and shipping products. We continue to expect X-Gene3 samples will be available before the end of our fiscal year which ends in March.We are seeing customer interest in this product as it offers socket levels beyond E5 and E7 class performance coupled with the maturity of an industry proven third-generation product. Finally, I'd like to report that we remain on-track with our X-Gene deployments in Asia where we are now running production traffic with one of the world's top eight mega-data center operator.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com

Good day ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Applied Micro Circuits Corporation Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Suzanne Schmidt, Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.
Suzanne Schmidt - Managing Director, The Blueshirt Group LLC
Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's conference call. On the call with me are Dr. Paramesh Gopi, President and CEO; and Marty McDermut, CFO.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that various remarks that we make on this call, including those about future financial results, including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, design wins, product plans, our competitive situation, market trends, statements about future development, production and adoption of X-Gene, X-Weave, HeliX, X-Tend, and other products and technologies, and our anticipated growth and profitability all constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These forward-looking statements and all other statements that may be made on this call that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, in particular to the section entitled Risk Factors, and to other reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and we disclaim any obligation to update them.
I would like to point out that a number of the securities analysts that cover our stock use various financial measures and this creates a range of variability relative to the Street financial model. When we say Street estimates, we mean the consensus of the major financial analyst models and they are not necessarily the guidance that was given by the company.
With that, I will turn the call over to Paramesh.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Suzanne. I'm pleased to announce that we closed our fiscal year with another quarter of sequential growth and that we exceeded our revenue and margin guidance.
In addition, I'd like to highlight key accomplishments from this past quarter. One, we unveiled X-Gene 3 performance specifications at the recent Open Server Summit. X-Gene 3 is expected to be the first ARM-based SoC to address the high end of the Xeon mainstream server market by offering roughly six times the performance of currently shipping X-Gene products. X-Gene 3's unprecedented level of overall performance combined with its best-in-class performance per watt makes it an ideal choice for mainstream high-volume servers.
According to Linley Gwennap "X-Gene is a disruptive product with the potential to change the game for general-purpose cloud computing". Please refer to the Linley Group's White Paper covering the key performance attributes of X-Gene 3 as posted on linleygroup.com. Based on these performance estimates, we see accelerating customer traction and interest from the top hyperscale data center operators both in the U.S. and in China.

Number two, I'm also happy to announce that key hyperscale data center customers in China are making excellent progress with their X-Gene platforms. Number three, APM demonstrated the industry's first single-lambda 100-gigabit-per-second PAM4 solution at the recent Optical Fiber Communications Conference and expects to lead the industry's transition to 400-gig with customer-sponsored devices.
And finally, I would now like to provide some color on the significant customer engagements and tractions that occurred this past quarter. First, I'm happy to note that we have secured POs and backlog that represent demand from key storage server and networking platform customers for our current X-Gene products. Second, at Mobile World Congress, we showed the Kontron SYMKLOUD converged infrastructure platform powered by X-Gene. This platform is designed to enable telco service providers to migrate their infrastructure from specialized hardware to commercial-off-the-shelf equipment supporting SDN and NFV capabilities, leveraging the server class performance and power efficiency of X-Gene ARM servers.
At Open Compute Summit, several of our platform partners announced new products based on X-Gene. Wistron, a leading ODM announced their X5 multi-services 5U OCP compliant chassis platform with X-Gene targeting both compute and storage market segment. XS a leading supplier of customized data center solutions announced that they have selected AppliedMicro's X-Gene for their next generation V-Raptor servers in an OCP compliant form factor.
Vapor IO, provider of the world's first intelligent hyper modular data center solution announced collaboration with APM to deploy Vapor IO's Open Data Center Runtime Environment on our 4-node OCP compliant X-Gene 2 server platform. The one half width one unit form factor server platform also integrates our X-Tend interconnect technology, which enables multiple generations of X-Gene SoCs to be seamlessly connected. As you can see, X-Gene has established a very large footprint industry-wide.
Above all, at the Open Server Summit this year, we announced our expected performance of X-Gene 3, our next generation flagship processor SoC with performance competitive with mainstream high-end Xeon E5/E7. I'd like to highlight the key unique features for X-Gene 3. One, high performance scores running over 3 gigahertz with strong scaling to 32 cores in a single socket, delivering socket level performance that exceeds the high end Xeon E5 family. Two, eight DDR channels that support 1 terabyte per socket, delivering the memory bandwidth and capacity of a 2P Xeon in a single X-Gene 3 socket. Three, general-purpose PCIe lanes to interconnect networking, storage and acceleration IO. X-Gene 3 builds upon the foundation of two generations of server products, which are battled hardened and that are currently shipping into a variety of data center, storage and HPC platforms.
Also at the Open Server Summit, we announced our follow-on generation, X-Gene 3XL which scales from X-Gene 3's 32 cores to deliver 64 cores per socket and extends coherency across sockets to deliver a 2P SMP, symmetric multiprocessing system. This continues our trajectory of delivering the leading edge compute performance at full rack scale.
Finally, we're pleased to announced that we've started shipping HeliX, our embedded ARM product line to leading Tier-1 networking platforms. We're also seeing strong design win activity across a wide variety of embedded application including, networking, storage and industrial platforms.
Turning now to our connectivity business, I'd like to make three key points. One, for 100-gig PAM4, we're the clear leader in this emerging high volume, high growth data center optical connectivity market. Multiple OEMs have chosen to sponsor development activities by funding multiple Customer Specific Standard Products or CSSPs with us.

Number two. The complete component ecosystem for single-lambda PAM4 has come together nicely as demonstrated by multiple optical component manufacturers at the recent Optical Fiber Communications Conference. Three, we are now looking to extend our technology lead and are working with customers to develop sponsored 400 gigabit per second solutions.
Additionally, this quarter we have added three major Tier-1 design wins with our X-Weave OTN and secure Ethernet product families that will have revenue contributions starting this fiscal year. With our X-Weave product line, including PAM4, secure Ethernet and OTN products, we are poised to capture meaningful revenue growth in the high volume rapidly growing data center optical connectivity market.
Let me summarize before I turn the call over to Marty. One, our current-generation X-Gene products are making excellent progress in the storage server and networking market segments worldwide. Two, X-Gene 3 is expected to be the first ARM-based SoC to address the high end of the Xeon mainstream server market by offering roughly six times the performance of currently shipping X-Gene products. X-Gene 3's unprecedented level of overall performance, combined with its best-in-class performance per watt makes it an ideal choice for mainstream high-volume servers. We are extremely excited by the accelerating customer traction that has resulted based on our performance estimates. Number three. We are leading the 100- and 400-gigabit-per-second PAM4 market, as evidenced by multiple customer-sponsored standard product engagements for our single-lambda 16-nanometer FinFET technology.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Marty, our CFO, for a review of the March quarter financials and our June quarter guidance. Marty?
Martin S. McDermut - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Paramesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of the financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter 2016, follow with comments on our balance sheet and finish with our fiscal first quarter 2017 guidance.
Fiscal fourth quarter 2016 revenues, gross margins and earnings either met or exceeded our guidance. Total revenues for the quarter increased to $41.1 million, a slight increase over the third quarter, our fifth consecutive quarter increase. Connectivity revenues increased to $23.2 million. As we commented last quarter, the growth was primarily driven by customer-sponsored engagements for our 16-nanometer PAM4 and mixed-signal technologies.
Computing revenues totaled $17.9 million, lower than the prior quarter but in line with earlier quarters. As expected, X-Gene revenues continue to grow. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2% higher compared to the prior quarter and guidance due to the greater portion of connectivity revenues and revenues from customer-sponsored engagements.
Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $25.8 million, higher than the prior quarter due to increased R&D expense, and lower than our guidance due to the shift of an anticipated mask tape-out. Non-GAAP tax expense was $200,000. Our non-GAAP net loss narrowed to $1.4 million or $0.02 per share.
On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the quarter was $8.9 million or $0.11 per share. Our non-GAAP financials exclude certain items required by GAAP. A complete reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financials is available in our fiscal fourth quarter 2016 earnings release, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and short-term investments were $83.8 million, up from the $76.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled $6.3 million, and cash from issuance of employee stock purchase plan shares totaled $1.7 million, which more than offset capital spending and other use of funds. Since most of the cash from operations resulted from temporary changes in working capital, we expect cash to return to the $74 million to $76 million level in the next quarter or two.

Finally, I'll turn to our outlook for the fiscal first quarter 2017. These are estimates based on our current knowledge and are subject to change. As such they're covered under our Safe Harbor statement.
We estimate revenue will range from $41 million to $42 million. We have good backlog coverage and channel inventories are lean. We expect non-GAAP gross margins will be in the range of 58% to 62%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $25.5 million to $27.5 million, which is up slightly compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the timing of the mask tape-out I talked about earlier. We expect our non-GAAP tax expense will be approximately $200,000. And finally we expect non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter to be a loss of $0.02 – plus or minus $0.02.
In summary, we continue to demonstrate financial and operational discipline as we execute on our operating plan. We'll continue to invest in the company's future growth and remain focused on maximizing shareholder value.
And operator, please open the call for questions.

Thank you. Our first question comes from Matt Ramsay of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Yes, thank you very much for letting me ask a question. Good afternoon, guys.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Matt. How are you?
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Doing well, thank you. I guess the first question I'll ask is for Marty. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the – a little bit lower than expected revenue in the computing business and the mix thereof with the gross margins moving higher? Is this a shift maybe away from some of the legacy PowerPC products more quickly than we had anticipated? Just any color on that mix and how it impacts the margins would be helpful as a start. Thanks.
Martin S. McDermut - Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Overall, the shift – you've seen it shift around the past year, and so this is back in line with the prior quarter, prior to Q3, I expect that we'll be at that level on this coming quarter. The margins are definitely – they are impacted, connectivity has higher margin as we talked about that, up to 10% higher. I mean that's sort of what's driving and what's driving the moves in the margins. And as you could see from the guidance this coming quarter, the margins are higher if you take the range that I've given, so we expect it to probably come in around the same levels.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Got it. Got it. And I guess should we think about these type of margins being sustainable on a gross margin basis going forward based on the mix or is there something that we should think about it in future quarters sort of pushing it back down into the range we've been in the last few quarters? Thanks.
Martin S. McDermut - Chief Financial Officer
We don't give what guidance farther out than a quarter, so I'll have to -
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Fair enough. Paramesh, there's been a few things happened in the ecosystem some of which are quite exciting around your X-Gene 3 platform. Maybe you can just talk a little bit more in detail about how the customer interactions have gone with that? And then secondly as I guess somewhat related comment, AMD is certainly been pushing to get back into the server space for a while and there is a big JV announcement in China that was quite topical in the capital markets. Maybe you can give your impressions of that as an alternative to – I mean lots of folks trying to diversify away from Intel, but there is, I guess, a new x86 player that's reemerged itself now, so how that might impact your business one way or the other going forward? Thanks

Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, Matt, maybe I can address the first part of the question. We've talked about X-Gene 3, we first talked about it at last November or early – late November or early December, with ARM TechCon we had received test ships, recognized that the biggest innovation that we've been working on for the last two-and-a-half years is the really, really robust coherent interconnect between all these cores.
And we've really done a lot of work to scale that up. And for the first time we talked about the performance numbers, I think we were very pleased that Linley who is an independent analyst, essentially for the first time when he saw those performance numbers, clearly understood the impact that it's going to have relative to the whole ARM SoC space.
So, I think it's been phenomenal because the customer traction that has resulted from the actual performance estimates, I mean obviously we disclosed the performance estimates at Open Server Summit, and the one thing that's happened over the last six months is that people have really used the first two generations of shipping product developed software. They've used the first two generations, and they've learned a lot in terms of what it means to really kind of inflect the market mainstream.
So, now we're talking about the full range of compute – (18:08) we're just talking about the full range of everything that we could possibly go and intercept a Skylake type generation with. So, I think the proven mature robust shipping technology coupled with the innovation in terms of scaling it up to 32 cores and up to 64 cores with X-Gene 3XL, we're now at a point, where technology-wise we've really, really established the key pieces for ARM to exist in this market in the appropriate way compared to the mainstream x86, right, number one.
Number two, when you talked about AMD in China, from our perspective, it's interesting to see this announcement. China as you know has for the longest time over the last few years, we mentioned this earlier, been a big proponent of having a non-x86 open ecosystem, right. And I think that drive continues to be there. Our engagements and customer traction in China is really, really good, people are – they've ported software, they've got all of the evaluation initial pieces all run, and I think from our perspective, it's great that they're looking at x86, but I got to tell you that ARM camp is really very, very strong relative to the fact that it has no ties whatsoever to Intel. So, I don't think the AMD news changes our prospectus all relative to ARM being there. In fact, I think it actually enhances it.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Thank you very much for the perspectives. Good afternoon.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Longiaru from Sidoti. Your line is open.
Christopher J. Longiaru - Sidoti & Co. LLC
Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I caught the Open Server Summit presentation and you talked a lot about comparative SPECint, when I go in and look at some of these, they're kind of all over the map. So, it depends on who you look at and what they're using it for. So where does yours fit in with respect to somebody like a Cisco or anything along those lines? Can you give me a little bit of color there?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, at the Open Server Summit, we talked about processors SPECint numbers, that have to do with per socket performance for different classes of server parts today that are currently being shipped by Intel, right, because they are the incumbent in the market. So, what we won – what we showed at Open Server Summit was that for the first time we had something that was well north of 500 SPECint per socket at the right socket power, the standard socket power that today Intel ships 2P systems with. So what that does is it breaks two barriers, breaks performance-per-watt barriers and more importantly, we can support 1-terabyte of memory per socket that breaks the entire memory to processor – number of processors barrier. So what we've done is essentially give you a real alternative to Skylake in a much more differentiated and tangible way.

Christopher J. Longiaru - Sidoti & Co. LLC
Okay. And how does that move, I mean, what's the goal with the next version of X-Gene, as you move through that, because right now, I think you said, you're – that X-Gene 3 is sort of pushing the high-end of E5 and above that. Are you looking towards kind of more momentum with the next version and kind of attacking some of the E7 class?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So, I think if you were to go and reflect on Intel's roadmap and reflect on the changes that have happened there, I think for the first time, we're seeing the convergence of the E5 and E7 classes of processors into one big mainstream E5 bucket, and this squarely addresses that in a very, very disruptive way.
Christopher J. Longiaru - Sidoti & Co. LLC
I'll jump out. Thank you very much.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Our next question comes from Cody Acree from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
David Williams - Drexel Hamilton LLC
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. This is David on for Cody; it's a little bit of a busy earnings night for us. I wanted to say first congrats on the Linley White Paper, it obviously was very positive comparisons against Xeon. Can you talk a little bit may be about the genesis of the paper and you covered a little bit of it already, but can you really maybe give us highlight what you thought were the key takeaways from the report?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So, I think for the first time in the – and I guess in APM's brief history of ARM, we had the opportunity to really leverage all of the existing shipping products maturity. We've actually built a whole ecosystem around X-Gene for ARM. And you think about the span of platforms between X-Gene 1 and X-Gene 2 really in the storage server space, we have POs for those types of parts today. We've already talked about how they will affect our revenue towards the second half of our fiscal year, as well as on the embedded side, we talked about HeliX shipping into key networking Tier-1 OEM switches.
One of the things that we had not talked about was what between X-Gene 1, X-Gene 2 and X-Gene 3, there is a pretty big quantum leap in terms of performance, right. And what we did was, we took two-and-a-half years, we essentially in stealth developed the key pieces of the interconnect that would let us scale the number of cores up from 8 to 32 and now to 64, right. So the genesis is, if you really look at Linley, Linley is a pretty recognized industry analyst. He's probably been one of the founders of the microprocessor report. He has had a lot to do with essentially commenting on the microprocessor industry.
And being very data driven, one of the things that we did this time, is we actually have estimates of all the performance data both from emulation as well as our test silicon. So we were able to really boil it all up before the product comes out and really talk it through as we exposed the product in the marketplace, in the future, right. So what it did was it – for the first time offered an analyst or other analyst, the ability to quantify all of the innovation that we had made technologically, and thus the genesis of the White Paper.
David Williams - Drexel Hamilton LLC
Great. Thanks. And then maybe could you give maybe a little stratification of what you're seeing in terms of design activity? Where are you seeing the most strength, and have you seen any major changes in the pace over the last quarter?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Our design activity has grown from the previous quarter, and it's kind of grown on two vectors. The amount of interest in X-Gene 3 has frankly been extremely exciting given the fact that we offer a Skylake-class part in that category right now. And the other thing that's been really exciting is all of the current generation, I'll call it processor, exceed the current generation parts moving like in the storage server front into early production, right.

And then I really want to – I don't want to leave you with – I want to leave you with one more message. We're really excited about our optical connectivity business. I mean we have two engines and the optical connectivity engine is really helping us, as you saw our margins, we are clearly driving PAM4 into high-volume data center applications, working with leading OEMs, leading web-centric module folks, and the web data center operators to really drive this technology mainstream, because we are the only ones who've taken the bold step of putting that technology into 16-nanometer FinFET, enabling the right density and the right power for these 100- and 400-gig installations.
David Williams - Drexel Hamilton LLC
Great. And then the last one for me, you talked a little bit about the competitor landscape a while ago, but are you hearing anything from customer engagements about maybe their level of potential interest in other ARM alternatives? I know you guys are clearly the leader, but are you hearing any discussions from customers about potentially looking at other ARM alternatives?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Honestly, I think we've said this before, I think we're very uniquely positioned given the fact that we were awarded the UniServer award for the H2020 UniServer technology evaluation, clearly puts us kind of head and shoulders above anybody else in terms of maturity, in terms of technology leadership. I think that we're happy to see that the rich ecosystem of people are participating in it; it's great for us. But I think from our perspective, we've been really forthcoming in terms of where we want to go with this. I mean, we've now announced, basically one-and-a-half more generations of technology and to give people an idea of where all this will land relative to Skylake and Skylake Plus, right. That's the real target for us.
David Williams - Drexel Hamilton LLC
Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck to you on next quarter.

Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks. Hey, Paramesh, can you give us a sense of the unit expectation for the fiscal year for X-Gene? I think last quarter you mentioned, 50,000 to 100,000. Is that still the working assumption?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No change, Hans. In fact, I think we said 50,000 to 100,000 from 18 to 24 months, take that and subtract three months, so 15 to 21 months, no change.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then – and that implies the exit rate for the year X-Gene being around 10% of sales?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think that's what Marty had indicated last time, correct.
Martin S. McDermut - Chief Financial Officer
Correct.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Can you give us the exit level or Q4 of the fiscal year, what percent of sales could be coming from PAM4?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I don't think we've broken that out, but what we did say last time, and Marty, what – the exact number we said was that it was going to be high single-digit percentages of our yearly revenue. So, you can imagine, look at – if you really look at it, the clear proof of the leadership is in the fact that we can talk about this as the market emerges, so which is really neat.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. So, PAM4 high single digits of fiscal 2017...
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Total revenue, fiscal 2017 revenue, correct, yeah.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Okay. And just for modeling purposes, is the September quarter kind of like the quarter where you start to see the ramp there at PAM4?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think what we've said is that, we've been – I don't think we've broken it out by quarter. Suffice it to say that these engagements are already in progress.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Hey, Marty, and just a follow-up for you on the financial side. The gross margin guidance is high. Is that a continuation of the customer payments for PAM4?
Martin S. McDermut - Chief Financial Officer
It's a combination of Connectivity's being at that steady state being a higher portion than prior quarter, and these engagements, these customer-sponsored engagements drive it up.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
And then the last one and I'll let others ask questions. For the rest of the fiscal year, how should we expect margins to kind of play out?
Martin S. McDermut - Chief Financial Officer
We said that we don't give guidance more than a quarter out.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
So when would the...
Martin S. McDermut - Chief Financial Officer
I was going to say, let me just comment that, Paramesh did say that this, we're real excited about the PAM4 opportunities and the customer-sponsorship and the effect it has on the margin, so.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And so, I just want to get a sense of, so this is an ongoing thing with this customer after this quarter, the June quarter. Can we...
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, Hans, let me go and set some context for you, so that there is absolute clarity here. Number one, we have multiple customers sponsoring customer-specific products for the high volume data center interconnectivity market, which means that typically this follows more of a Customer Specific Standard Product model from the likes of the Avago's of the world. These things usually stretch – development stretch is anywhere between 9 months to 15 months after which you have a volume because that is very large, because they've skin in the game, which is why they are actually working with us to build these products. So, I think that should give you context of the framework that you should think about.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Very helpful. Thanks guys.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Hans.

Our next question is from Suji De Silva from Topeka. Your line is open.
Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets
Hi, Paramesh. Hi, Marty. A question on the products portfolio you have now, are you still seeing that X-Gene, X-Weave, PAM4 and HeliX are all kind of selling independently or are there instances where the customer wants two or three of these together for a specific reason?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, I would treat them as completely independent at this point.
Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets
Okay. That's fair. And then the other thing is looking ahead to sort of Intel Skylake and on the future, and they are making architectural shifts, perhaps to kind of match some of the things you guys are bringing to the market. I just want to understand how you contrast to what they may be trying to move toward in X-Gene 3 and where the competitive differentiation will be in that future point, if you can comment on that?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Two things, that we bring, one is for the first time, we're actually bringing you E7 class memory, so you have eight channels of DDR4, you can support a terabyte per socket. Along with really, really, robust high-end E5 class core. So we've actually essentially done our own version of collapsing two large pieces of performance into one die, right. So, with X-Gene 3, you have from a technology point of view something that converges the need of all of our hyperscale customers which is to de-constraint memory and compute performance, number one.

Number two, with X-Gene 3XL we talked about. I mean by the way one other thing before I move on. I made this in my prepared comments. We're essentially taking a 2P system and putting it on one die, with X-Gene 3, Suji. And then, we've gone one step further and we talked about the announcement of the technology that comes after X-Gene 3 which is X-Gene 3XL, where we essentially are able to do 64 cores on one die, right. So, what we are essentially doing is really making sure that from a technology perspective, we're going to offer the absolutely top class performance for ARM compute along with no constraints or as little constraints as possible on the memory sub-system supported for a single physical implementation of the socket. Does that kind of makes sense?
Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets
Yeah. I was just wondering if what Intel is doing in terms of their roadmap starts to move towards that opportunity as well with their – are they bundled things or whether that's not what you perceive beyond their roadmap?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I'll give you one example, right. If you look at the highest NE5 that's been announcement or I think has been talked about there, they're only talking about six channels of memory.
Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets
Yes.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So the price quanta between six channels of memory and eight channels of memory is a massive step function. Again, what we're doing is, giving customers or de-constraining them from memory and core performance. We're actually offering you both at the right intersect point. You're not going to have to pay huge amounts of extra dollars to get access to more memory. That's a huge differentiation, right.
Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets
Yeah. Very helpful, Paramesh. Maybe one question for Marty. Marty, what's the operating leverage in the model longer term, just help us understand maybe quantify or just qualitatively just kind of explain that?
Martin S. McDermut - Chief Financial Officer
I mean, our approach here is to have minimal growth in the expenses as we start to ramp the revenues up to where we get rapidly accelerating to higher operating margins in the 20%s.
Suji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets
All right. Very clear. Okay. Thanks guys.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Suji.

Our next question is from Krishna Shankar from ROTH Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Krishna Shankar - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Yes. Paramesh, congratulations on the X-Gene milestones. As you talk about the connectivity business and the guidance for Q3 is a lot of the growth for the June quarter driven by the connectivity business or how much of that is also due to embedded and the continuing ramp of X-Gene?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, I think, Krishna, all those three contribute to the next quarter's revenue number. From our perspective, I made some comments earlier on, on the call, we are now engaged with multiple connectivity customers to bring 100-gig and 400-gig to the market. We also talked about the multiple customer-sponsored standard products – Customer Specific Standard Products that we're engaged in, that's one component.
The other component of it is HeliX, HeliX is ramping in some of the world's largest networking switch SKUs. And the other piece of it is obviously X-Gene, which I think Marty mentioned in his prepared comments has sequentially grown. So, I think all those three are contributing to the number next quarter. And I think from our perspective, also frame this with a notion that these customer-sponsored engagements will span a year. And that started last quarter, right a year to 15 months. So, I hope that gives you enough color to kind of see where things are going, and that's why we're very excited.

Krishna Shankar - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Okay. And then what makes the optical connectivity chip customer specific, does this work with their A6 for switching or router application or what makes this customer specific as opposed to application-specific standard part?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's a really, really good question. So, two or three things. One is most of these customers are driven by shipping into really large enterprises or data centers, so you can know where the volume are large. When that happens, you usually have your own IP, whether it's IP that relates to your particular algorithm to do something proprietary for a rack or a server cluster, that's one piece. The other piece of it is frankly the optics. At the end, what's going to drive this market is the ability to have really good cost points for optics, so various people who are shipping very high volume today in this market or data center customers who are buying very high volume have really centered on how do we bring the right algorithms to play to drive the correct set of optics at the right cost and VaR points. And what they need is the right silicon foundation which is 16-nanometer, 56- and 100-gig SerDes and (37:56) and DACs and we bring that along with our DSP. So, think of programmability, the right mixed-signal power and density product, that is being offered to a guy who either runs the data center or who ships into a data center. And that makes the whole thing kind of hum.
Krishna Shankar - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just final question on the X-Gene, currently are you shipping both the X-Gene 1 and X-Gene 2 for revenues?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
Krishna Shankar - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Okay. Thank you.

We have a follow up question from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord. Your line is open.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Yeah. Paramesh, thanks for let me jump back in. The PAM4 sort of sponsored or semi-custom design that your guys are doing, maybe you could just talk to us philosophically about that type of engagement, right. So why pursue that type of engagement versus just interacting with the customer and pursuing a roadmap? Why are they willing to pay upfront, it's a very different revenue model from what you guys – I mean, as you mentioned some others in the industry have done that, but it's something new for your team? So, just maybe a little bit around that and just if there is any weird accounting or anything that goes along with that, because it's a little bit different and it's obviously impacting the margins quite a bit. So I just think sort of little clarity there might be helpful. Thank you.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, can I maybe start by saying that this is not a strange model for the company. I'll remind you, if you go back five years Alcatel-Lucent, I can tell you this because it was five years ago used to pay us to build CSSPs for them, other big optical companies have done the same, where we can have a version of it, that we can sell commercially and a version of it that we can customize for them. So, a) the model is not new to the company. What is new to the company is the mixed-signal technology that we're bringing to this whole market.
So let me take a step back. I'll go back and tell you that the key to the optical connectivity market in the data center are the ability to get the lowest power per gigabit per second of traffic optical module into a faceplate of a switch or a cluster – into a faceplate at the top of the rack switch or a cluster switch. In other words, the traffic is growing at a hyper-exponential rate. I mean if you look at Cisco's estimates or Google's estimates, you can see that, right? So 100-gig today exists in the form of a very big 4-by-25 or 3-by-40 or 2-by-50 type of solution, which does not fit into a QSFP type form factor and a power that is anywhere between 4 and 6 watts per port.

Now let's look at where things are going. It's pretty clear that this is going to be the year of 50-gig Ethernet ports on switches, right. That's happening. The switch market is moving there. It's also pretty clear that the rate at which traffic is going, several clusters are going to have multi-terabit switches that are going to be connecting them together. That's already happened in some of the big data centers. It's going to happen across both the data center and the enterprise.
So what did we do and why are we in this pole position? Three years ago, we made the bet that we wanted to take all of our fundamental long-haul Forward Error Correction IP, all of our A2D and D2A technology that we've developed for things that are lower rates like the 10-gigabit rate, or the 40-gigabit rate or the 28-gigabit rate, all of SerDes components and then move them to FinFET as well as move the fundamental, programmable DSP engine that we had to accommodate these types of functions for 16-nanometer FinFET.
So the end of that entire IP creation process was somewhere in the fall of last year. A bunch of customers, including end data center operators, wanted to see this kind of working, because they couldn't believe that we could move all this IP at a particular power point and get them what they wanted. So, now as soon as we showed what we were able to do between the optics maturing, between people wanting the higher densities at the lowest possible power, at the lowest possible cost, they basically said, well, you guys are the only ones with proven IP, and so what they did was, in one fell swoop, all of the people who were going to ship millions of units over the next three to five years, decided that they needed to partner with us. Does that answer the question?
Matthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Yeah, and that's helpful for context. I appreciate the patience. Thanks.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No problem.
Operator
We have a second follow-up question from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. Hey, Paramesh, can you give us a sense of the state of the connectivity market, the end-market data center versus the service provider, what's happening out there as you engage with customers just on an ongoing basis?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I think it's pretty clear that – let me start with the data center first and I'll get to the service provider. It's pretty clear that every data center guy that we've talked to or that has engaged with us today have – and in their minds once we showed them the 100-gig technology, they're like, okay, where is 400-gig? So people are already starting to move their entire focus to saying, you've now demonstrated 100-gig working; we're going to go now and move this to more of a – okay, it's the technology piece of it is done, you guys are on the path to develop really compelling customizations for various high-volume applications. How do we now bring your focus to 400-gig?
Because when you have a bunch of 100-gig front ports on a switch, you need something to aggregate them all, so the next big logical alternative is 400-gig, right. So a data center guy today, if you talk to the leading guys who are shipping – I'm not talking about shipping 10,000 units for data center interconnect between data centers. I'm talking about guys who basically run a million servers, okay. All those guys are basically telling us, guys, we need to accelerate 400-gig. First of all, get 100-gig done – you guys are done, let's go focus on 400-gig. That's where the state of the industry and the customer traction is today. 100-gig is yesterday's – as far as they're concerned, we have a path, we know the cost points, we're going to deal with it. You guys are it.

Now, how do we build 400-gig? That's where everybody's focused on, in terms of optics, in terms of mixed signal, in terms of SerDes et cetera. Spending there, Hans, continues unabated. In fact I'll quote a very large data center operator, and he told me this less than six weeks ago he said, if you guys had a 100-gig a year ago, I would have used it, I would be buying it. So, they're not waiting – I mean they want the higher rates, right. That's number one.
Number two, as far as the service provider is concerned, I think it's interesting to see a lot of the service provider equipment that people like Alcatel and Cisco are building, being consumed by data center operators or being consumed by the service provisioning piece of AT&T or Verizon, that deals with the data center operators. You know that Verizon had a major contract that's happened this summer, that's really helped. We talked about it in the past. It has had a very positive effect on these margins as you can see today. We also see the peering points that AT&T has with guys like Amazon or Facebook, starting to use more and more carrier class equipment or packet optical equipment where our chips are being designed in.
So, fundamentally, I think you'll see the data center market driving, and the service provider market following. And you'll see service provider platform is being used in the data center market and vice versa in the future. Does that kind of makes sense?
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah. It does. It does. Another question if I can? Was there any impact to the ZTE situation that was announced in early March?
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Go ahead, Marty.
Martin S. McDermut - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Well, the issue has been resolved, I think, we do sell to ZTE, we said that the revenues are about mid single digits to us. Right now, the issues have been resolved. We are shipping to them and recognizing revenue. If that changes, if the U.S. Government decides to cut them off again, it's possible that we're going to have an impact to our results. However, somebody else would probably going to step in and start shipping product, if they drop out of a market, but right now, it's business as usual and we are not aware of any other issues out there at this point.
Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Hans.
Operator
Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Paramesh Gopi for closing remarks.
Paramesh Gopi - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Thank you all for taking the time and have a good day.

Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Applied Micro Circuits Corporation's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Suzanne Schmidt with Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Suzanne Schmidt
Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining today's conference call. On the call with me today are Dr. Paramesh Gopi, President and CEO; and Marty McDermut, CFO.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that various remarks that we make on this call, including those about future financial results, including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, design wins, product plans, our competitive situation, market trends, statements about future development, production and adoption of X-Gene, X-Weave, HeliX, X-Tend, and other products and technologies, and our anticipated growth and profitability, all constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These forward-looking statements and all other statements that may be made on this call that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, in particular to the section entitled Risk Factors, and to other reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC for additional information on the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update them.
I would like to point out that a number of the securities analysts that cover our stock use various financial measures, and this creates a range of variability relative to the Street financial models. When we say Street estimates, we mean the consensus of the major financial analyst models and they are not necessarily the guidance that was given by the Company.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Paramesh.
Paramesh Gopi
Thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased with what we've accomplished this past quarter. We delivered solid financial results highlighted by our 7th sequential quarter of revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings of $0.02 per share. In fact, this marks our first quarter of profitability since the beginning of 2015.
Let me start by reviewing key operating achievements from this past quarter and follow with important customer developments that illustrate the increasing traction we are seeing across our business. First, on the computer side. I would like to highlight that HP Enterprise, the industry's leading storage vendor announced the launch of their high volume enterprise storage using our X-Gene ARM-based processor solutions. Second, this was a milestone quarter for our connectivity business on multiple fronts; notably, the IEEE standards body recommended the adoption of Applied Micro single lambda 100 gigabit per second PAM4 Solution to be an industry standard for enterprise and datacenter connectivity. This is important because it positions Applied Micro's technology as a solution of choice for datacenter connectivity going forward.

We expect an accelerated PAM4 adoption cycle given the move towards standardizing around our approach, and the clear value this technology brings to customers. Also on the connectivity front, we saw record shipments of our X-Gene OTM and five products across our Tier 1 customer base, an unprecedented demand for our industry leading Ethernet security products.
Turning now to our computer business. HP Enterprise introduced the StoreVirtual 3200, the industry's 64-bit ARM-based high volume enterprise storage platform which is based on Applied Micro's X-Gene Technology. This platform targets large enterprise customers and their private clouds. HPE chose our X-Gene 64-bit server on a chip solution because it provides a powerful computing engine, multiple integrated 10-gigabit and 1-gigabit Ethernet networking port, and multiple PCIe Gen 3 lane for storage expansion; all in a single socket. X-Gene provided a clear and substantial cost savings for HPE when compared with existing x86 based platform solution. This latest collaboration with HPE underscores the continued penetration of X-Gene based platforms into enterprise areas that were once effectively controlled by x86 based chip.
In addition during the quarter we successfully tapped out our next-generation X-Gene3 processor using TSMC 60 nanometer FinFET Technology. We are thrilled to share with you that X-Gene3 is expected to deliver six times the performance of currently flipping X-Gene product and is targeted to compete with mainstream high-end beyond E5 and E7 processors in a similar power. With eight DDR4 channels, X-Gene3 outclasses beyond E5 memory bandwidth, making it well suited to hyperscale workload such as in-memory computing, Big Data, and machine learning. X-Gene3 is built upon two generations of industry hardened and shipping products. We continue to expect X-Gene3 samples will be available before the end of our fiscal year which ends in March.
We are seeing customer interest in this product as it offers socket levels beyond E5 and E7 class performance coupled with the maturity of an industry proven third-generation product. Finally, I'd like to report that we remain on-track with our X-Gene deployments in Asia where we are now running production traffic with one of the world's top eight mega-data center operator.
Turning now to our connectivity business. As I mentioned earlier, this was a milestone quarter on a number of fronts. As you know our connectivity business provides OTM framers, mappers, five Ethernet security products, and PAM4 Technology to Tier 1 data center and service providers around the world. We would like to take this opportunity to provide color on the importance of our PAM4 Technology to the future of enterprise and data center connectivity. Picture a large data center, 1.5 million to 1 million square feet in size, several stories high, and filled with network server-rack on a fixed power button. The only way to content rapid traffic good within such a data center is to enable high capacity, low power connectivity between servers and switches. Current 100-gigabit per second module solutions use either two or four lasers and a corresponding number of photodiode [ph]. This results in high power, high cost and low density thereby limiting the number of connections within a fixed power footprint.
The current solutions use 28 nanometer planar processes and unoptimized photonics. In contrast, our single lambda PAM4 enables a single laser module to carry four times the data rate when compared with current module. Our ground-breaking DSP and analog mixed signal, 60 nanometer FinFET solutions, leap frog today's high power multi-laser solutions by enabling a low power, high density, and highly manufacturable module with 75% fewer optical components and 50% better power efficiency. We believe our PAM4 Technology to be the most viable way to scale current enterprise and data center connectivity to 400-gigabit per second with an industry standard module form factor. Consequently, Tier 1 OEM have committed NRE dollars to Applied Micro towards 100 and 400-gigabit per second custom solution, providing us good visibility on customer demand and market adoption.

The readiness of 100 or 400-gigabit per second PAM4 was demonstrated at the recent European Conference on Optical Communications where our partners and us demonstrated a fully operational 100-gig single laser PAM4 solution over single-mode fiber. This also served as the catalyst for the industry-wide IEEE standardization process and announcement that I mentioned earlier.
Moving now to our secured Ethernet product; we have expanded our customer footprint beyond North American and European Tier 1 sockets, and are pleased to announce our first design win in China. We would like to reiterate our expectation that secured Ethernet revenues will begin to ramp in the first part of calendar 2017. All of this clearly demonstrate a significant fraction we are seeing for our connectivity products worldwide.
To summarize our key business highlights from the quarter, industry-leading storage OEM are shifting platforms powered by X-Gene. X-Gene3 has successfully kept up. Finally, momentum in our connectivity business continues to accelerate driven by our PAM4 products and our X-3 [ph] and secured Ethernet solution.
I will now turn the call over to Marty McDermut, our CFO, for a review of the September quarter financials and our December quarter guidance.
Martin McDermut
Thank you, Paramesh, and good afternoon everyone. I'll start with a review of the financial results for the fiscal second quarter 2017, follow with comments on our balance sheet, and finish with our fiscal third quarter 2017 guidance.
Our key financial metrics for the fiscal second quarter 2017 came in at or above guidance ranges that we provided last quarter. Total revenues for the quarter increased to $41.8 million, our seventh consecutive quarterly revenue increase. Connectivity revenues increased to $30.2 million. The sequential growth was driven by increased sales of our OTM, and FI products and by strong customer demand across Tier 1 data center and service provider customer platform.
Our new products accounted for most of the game. Our X-Weave 100-gig OTM framer is mapping in some of the best-selling platforms in the industry and our X-Weave secured Ethernet products initial ramp also contributed to this upside. Computing revenues totaled $11.6 million for the quarter, lower sequentially due to order patterns for our legacy PowerPC products.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 66.6% above the high end of our guidance range. Gross margins increased sequentially due to the higher mix of connectivity revenue, improved yields, lower materials and other cost. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $25.8 million, lower than the prior quarter, primarily due to lower mask tape-out and new product introduction costs. Our non-GAAP tax expense was $200,000. Non-GAAP net income for the September quarter was $2.1 million or $0.02 per share.
On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the quarter was $4.6 million or $0.05 per share; more than 50% reduction from the GAAP loss per share during the prior quarter. Our non-GAAP financials exclude certain items required by GAAP, a complete reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financials is available on our fiscal second quarter 2017 earnings release, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and short-term investments was $81.7 million, down slightly from $82.3 million at the end of the prior quarter. Operating activity used $900,000 excluding working capital changes operations generated $4 million positive cash flow. We used $800,000 for capital expenditures which was more than offset by cash from issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan.
Our balance sheet continues to be well managed, our networking capital increased by $2.8 billion dollars to $88.7 million. Current assets increased by $3.4 million and were partially offset by $600,000 increase in the liabilities. Our day sales outstanding and our accounts receivables was 29 and based on ending inventory returns are about 4.2.

Finally, I'll turn to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter 2017; and these are estimates based on our current knowledge and are subject to change, as such they are covered by a Safe Harbor statement.
We estimate revenues will range between $42.5 million and $43.5 million. We continue to have strong backlog coverage. We expect non-GAAP gross margins be in the range of 63% to 67%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range $25 million to $27 million, in line with this last quarter. And we expect our non-GAAP tax expense will be approximately $200,000. Finally, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter to be income of $0.02, plus or minus $0.02.
And with that operator, please open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open.
Cody Acree
Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations guys on the progress and return to profitability. Maybe Marty if we could just start with you on the strong gross margins; I guess if we're continuing to see this level of connectivity growth, how high can those margins go and then as you start to see X-Gene ramp in. And what might be the impact of -- how does that level off margins at some point?
Martin McDermut
Okay. One I mean it is, you could see the connectivity revenues through the last quarter and that accounted for almost all of the increase there was some part of the increase due to the lower doing the cost reduction effort. We've said that during the last quarters call that I think if we're in the low 60s per margin on an average basis, that's a good place for you to target but it's going to move around quarter to quarter because our product mix moves quarter-to-quarter. Looking out into the next team ramps going in the next year, I mean there -- that's more middle of the road margins for us. So there will be -- I don't expect a lot of impact from it going forward.
Paramesh Gopi
So Cody just to give me some more clarity -- you can see how strong our connected business have been -- it's been a phenomenal quarter for us. I also recognize that team actually consistently moved our margin profile up which is what we said we were going to do and we were -- we are continuing to drive that going forward because our new products that be ramping extremely good margin profile on both sides of the business.
Cody Acree
Paramesh, if we can switch gears -- I guess and help us maybe understand some of the impact of some of your announcements this quarter, specifically around the IEEE standard. How did that come about? What does that mean for the world? How does that accelerate things and how do we put some kind of volume estimates around?
Paramesh Gopi
Very good question. So I think there has been a lot of talk about PAM4 for the last -- probably two years. And really people have essentially used that in a in a loose way to talk about multiple types of optical module solution. For the first time, I think there is a significant two move towards changing the module landscape going forward to have a single-laser 100-gigabit per second; and the only way you can do that in a sub four to five module is to have in fact advanced DSP technology, and advanced mixed signal analog technology, all come together with photonics. So I think there has been a lot of talk about PAM4. We have -- we now have taken all of -- probably three and a half years' worth of work that we have done and have led the industry from a development point-of-view. And it was our solution that catalyzed a move to standardize the technology across module form factors and module members.
What does that do? First of all it renders the two laser and four solutions, rather important going forward. Second, it starts to really build a new ecosystem of 100 and 40-gig type modules in 2017. We've always said that this is going to happen, people are paying us to build semi-custom solutions for volumes, and now you have a standards body that's going to make it a mandate. So what does that do for us? It puts us on a very nice track to having a very clear visible growth pattern over the next few years. And it's no longer determined by elastic factors that are beyond our control but mostly, all now driven by standards and we probably have in my opinion -- two-year lead on anybody else. So we stand to gain and poised to gain a very -- expect to gain a very good share of this market as it evolves.

Cody Acree
And then lastly, the workload orders that you received last quarter -- you talked about last quarter, have you used follow-on orders or any feedback that you can talk about just how is that -- those first workload orders starting to shape up?
Paramesh Gopi
So Cody, can you rewind? When you say workload, can you be more specific.
Cody Acree
Well, you announced on the last call that you have received your first workload orders; production server orders for X-Gene and you talked about two different customers; service provider and data center operator. I'm just wondering what the feedback has been from the customers? Have they come in and ordered more, just what is the statement here?
Paramesh Gopi
They are doing, the feedback is definitely we mentioned one of them in our prepared remarks; they are fully in the production traffic phases, so this is now real-time in their yield production environment and so that's a huge validation of the technology and it's robustness and the other engagement proceeding just as we expected and we are very pleased with the progress on it.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
Matthew Ramsay
Thank you very much, good afternoon. Paramesh, I wanted to follow-up on the PAM4 stuff and obviously you guys are making progress there with the [indiscernible] and the NRE funded work for a couple of partners, specifically though could you talk to any kind of potential revenue target in the 2018 to 2020 time frame for you guys and if there are any contractual volume orders attached to any of those NRE payments that you can walk us through a little bit just so that we can bound the problem and lastly just to complete that conversation I think we had talked in the past about say $750 million PAM for those type of modules is that still sort of a ball park PAM that you're going after there? Thanks.
Paramesh Gopi
Yes, so let me start by saying that yes there are volumes associated with all those contractual agreements, yes we said there are going to be high signal percentage of our yearly revenue fully on track and yes all of those will start the ramp in the second half of our fiscal -- of calendar 2017, we talked about and yes the IEEE standardization does accelerate and make certain the way this market evolve.
Now to go back to your PAM question, the PAM for all optics in that market is I think too close to what we said between 500 million and 750 million specifically for single lambda and for what I call single lambda 50 and 400 gig, there is going to be an adoption code associated with that market. I believe that adoption curve will start to really ramp towards the second half of our 2017 and the fact that we're leading the charge there along with the various photonics partners and the IEEE gives an extremely good position to take a good share of that market. Just you asked about quantifying this market if you really think about it Matt, before the IEEE standards process you would say that for typical market ramp we're talking about for a new technology to ramp in to an existing market, it takes between 18 and 24 months that is with no standards. With standards we will definitely see at least a 50% change in the adoption grade curve so that should give you an idea of how to map and how to model this but nobody gives guys like us significant financial dollars upfront without a volume commitment as you know.
Matthew Ramsay
I guess for either of you guys I want to get a little bit more of an understanding as to the decline of the computing revenue, in your prepared remarks you attributed that mostly to declines of legacy PowerPC products. Maybe you can talk about the magnitude of the legacy product declines, amount of that particular types of legacy products that are still in the revenue run-rate and how we should think about modeling the strip out X-Gene for now but the non-X-Gene portion of the computing business how we should think about modeling that for the next several quarters obviously that revenue has moved around quite a bit. Thanks.

Paramesh Gopi
As I said in remarks too that we cyclicality from that product line. Now going I think in the last quarter's call I talked about that we see headwinds not from all the compute [ph] products but from some of them which is dampening the impact of the ramp that we're seeing in our new products I expect those to be declining to go away early next year when you start seeing additional growth from the top line [Technical Difficulty] of both sides.
Martin McDermut
So Matt, just to be clear, I don't know whether you've noticed a number of that is actually [indiscernible] we had a $30 million connectivity quarter and our guidance reflects two things, one is the connectivity business being very strong, margins being very strong and we're able to essentially take the PowerPC declines and obviously supplement that in large part as ARMs start to take market share with our connectivity revenue. So from a planning perspective we're very confident that the connectivity business and our base business is extremely robust and not just robust from a margin perspective but just look at the rate of designing. I think last time we said we close through the record quarter for our design win closure, right, so we're extremely well-poised to drive our base connectivity business [indiscernible] to sustain our company and growth projects.
Matthew Ramsay
That's helpful. I need to sneak in one more to be a little more granular on the forward outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Would you think that this would be a trough quarter for the combined computing business or is there still some of that legacy business that might come out, I'm just trying to figure out how model mix going forward and how that might relate to gross margins. Thanks guys.
Martin McDermut
We stopped the range for this coming quarter. We brought down you know the margins a little bit and that's because you will see a shift in the business between connectivity and computing. So I think as we said some headwinds going forward but it's to be stable in the last probably should be stable through the end of the year.
Paramesh Gopi
And to add to what Marty said if you go back and look at the margin band in our guidance we're walking the margin band up by a couple of percentage points every single quarter that should give you a good way to assess the robustness and underpinnings of the way we run our business.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Steven Smigie with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Steven Smigie 
I was looking to follow-up a little bit [Technical Difficulty] and production, the sampling you talked about. Can you talk a little bit about breadth of customers that you expect on the sampling and then in terms of timing, how long from a sample to win [Technical Difficulty].
Paramesh Gopi
Sure, just to be clear right, I mean this is going to be the actual first and most significant part from an ARM 64 perspective that will have the ability to compete with Skylink [ph] and we have talked about this over the last quarter or quarter and half, we have actually had many announcements and many I will call it [indiscernible] in terms of what it can do. I recognize that we see very wide interest all the way from where our existing customers where mega data center operators to enterprise type folks like HPE who are already shipping actually one type programs with us. But our focus [Technical Difficulty] to be clear is that mega data center kind of market and I believe that it has all of the right features from a memory addressability perspective from a technology TDP perspective to essentially really be right in the middle of a [indiscernible] class processor.
So from our prospective that's what we have always targeted, we're very, very happy to say that now the chips and the fab are on track to whatever we expected to do last quarter. Finally I think we have always maintained that you won't see [indiscernible] revenue have any big impact until our fiscal '18.

Steven Smigie
And I assume you could talk a little bit more about PAM4, my sense there is that there have some question marks about how big PAM4 is going to be for a 100G but that as we get to 200 and above it has to go to PAM4, and there is some that I think they are starting to suggest that maybe 100-G even won't be that long of a cycle and 200-G maybe coming more quickly than anticipated. So I think that sort of sets you guys up very well that doesn't need turn out to be true and we have to turn the PAM4 and obviously with -- you would be in a strong position to really capitalize on that. So I was hoping you could comment a little bit what you see as a percentage of 100-G and PAM4 and how quickly or maybe 200G could come?

Let me just make, first of all good question. Two things, when we look at PAM4 adoption look at what drives it? It's basically space played [ph] density in a rack. So rack has a fixed amount of power between 2 and 2.5 kilowatts. It has X number of 50-gig or 100-gig Ethernet port. And so at some level that fiber and plumbing in a rack and between rack and between data centers goes in the numbers like one and four. So there is no -- I mean for us a 200-gig solution is definitely viable but when we did -- when we looked at it, it was 100-gig and 400-gig, those were the two things that are going to straddle the growth in this market.
Why? Look at graphic statistics that Cisco puts out every month. I mean we're getting hyper exponential growth of traffic in all of these data centers networks. There is probably three to five new data centers being built every year with roughly about half a million to million servers each over a million square feet of data center, right. So really speaking, we're looking at 100-gig solutions that are more short span and 400-gig solutions that are more long-stand. And fundamentally, these two things are only possible if you have 100-gig base working with DST and the CMOS analog front-end. So that gives you some color on what it takes to participate in 100-gig and 400-gig.
The other big thing that I think cause the standard to go really fast was -- today the pricing of a module, the producability of the module are all depending on the manufacturing yield. This is common sense but sometimes gets ignored; more optics, more problems; more power, less yield. Smaller number of lasers, better yield, less cost and more power. So that's what this technology is going to be critical in driving into the data center in terms of size. If you take the entire market to be between 500 million and 750 million, that includes all the four lambda, 4/25 meet -- 8/25, all of these different feeds; and you say well, what percentage of data centers will switch to it.
Look at it option; they go anywhere between 10% and 30% over the first two years. As I said earlier in my comments, with the standardization we can easily cut that down by factor. I hope that helps.
Steven Smigie
Great. And last question was just -- I think you got a nice win there with 8-key. I believe that was on X-Gene1 and obviously we're very excited about X-Gene3 but to get a X-Gene1 – can you give a little bit more color, any rental wins there? And for that matter, on X-Gene2 as well that we see a potential contraction as customers think?
Paramesh Gopi
Good question, we are very excited about this whole storage platform because for the first time people talked about various feed volume and this is an example of how you see an important volume marker in the ARM space. So there is no better proof than you going -- than you looking at customers -- HPs and customers, the likes of UPS or FedEx or Walmart buying the stuff. Now you're moving this into mainstream. You know, this is what from a maturity perspective Steve, it shows what it takes to go run into a mainstream enterprise platform, and we're very proud because from an ARM technology perspective, I don't think any of the other ARM vendors have had this level of success. And by the way we're having this success with X-Gene1. So you can imagine the potential that lies in X-Gene3.

Steven Smigie
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, this is Corey Grady [ph] for Rick Schafer. I just have one question; with all your new design wins and product ramps, can you talk a little bit about how we should think about incremental R&D going forward?
Paramesh Gopi
I think this is a good base; if you look at the past two -- I mean the guide for this; I mean the actual results for the quarter and the quarter, a good day's work off of what can drive it up and down and any additional tape-ups that we have that we expense and those can run into each one about $1.5 million if we have some project cost in new project introduction cost. So this is -- we're aiming the R&D spend pretty stable except for that -- except for that variable that depends on our new product activity and I think that from what we've talked about the product that are going to come onboard.
Martin McDermut
Yes. So I think another way to look at it is that -- what will change is primarily is math ending up.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Chris Rollins with Hanna [ph] International Group. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey guys, congrats on a really nice quarter here. So, long-term you guys think maybe a year out -- something like that. I know the simple questions on this but how should we think about compute -- should we think about this as a new steady state or a bounce back. I mean it is like mid-teens revenue per quarter like a real number. And then for connectivity, is this kind of a one-time thing or is this a new steady state or could we even grow from this level as we work out like into next year? I mean I think our heads are turning to spending with all those volatility in your segments. So any kind of clues you could give us would be great.
Paramesh Gopi
Sure. I think from our perspective Chris, we don't guide more than one quarter out but just to give you the notion of the connectivity business; these new products, if you really look at it; we have a secured Ethernet product line that is really ramping well. We have huge momentum in terms of our OTN and five products. And we've talked about this for the last four quarters in terms of our leadership positions from a technology perspective on PAM4 which then converted over the people doing semi-custom engagements with the likes of what they would [ph]. So we are planning for sustainability and been driving growth momentum on the connectivity business. So none of -- when you asked about is this a one quarter, two quarter phenomenon; I want to look -- if you really think about it what drove this quarter is stuff that is all centered around -- that's the way you want to be, right.
On the computer side, we've always thought that our PC is kind of in the structural decline; we've maintained that for a long time and we've said that we would make sure that overall from a company perspective, we would continue to drive connectivity and to make sure that our PC business allows us a base to transition to ARM [ph], nothing has changed in that calculation.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And I guess what we think about camp four years -- so I think it's like a DST and a converter on 30's or something. Does that part lie in the transceiver module itself? And then also who are your biggest competitors here? Is it IN5, is Micro-Semi or are there other guys out there or do you have no competitor, whatsoever? And lastly, what percent of your products do you sell to hyperscale guys now; do you know that?
Paramesh Gopi
Chris, first let me answer the first part of the question; and I didn't quite hear the last part. There was a little bit of disturbance, if you can repeat it.

Unidentified Analyst
Sure. So I asked about where this product lies; is it in the transceiver module? I asked who your competitors were in five Micro-Semi or other guys. And then lastly, what percent of your revenue comes from hyperscale?
Paramesh Gopi
Okay, great. First is that it is the heart of the module, it is the silicon that enables the optics to actually go and signals for different entities of light. So it lies right smacking them; number one. Number two, you asked about who are the competitors? We own the closest competitor to us, it's probably Alago [ph] Broadcom and then after that -- we're probably 18 months ahead of INFI [ph] in terms of building something like this. INFI talked about PAM4, I think they did a great job evangelizing it. And they've built, however they built two and four laser types of -- it's not single laser. So that's very important.
Third; you asked about hyperscale. Assume that people who are paying us money, their entire opportunity is all about the risk. Nobody would pay us money for low volume optical [ph]. And then the fourth part of it is; I think -- I'll add to what you asked; a significant portion of this comes because of very large early investments in FinFET Technology. So we had the inside track because we called the data center guys for exchange; we knew that this single laser is going to be the key to volume in this timeframe. The IEEE standardization just pretty much locks the whole thing up for us.
Unidentified Analyst
Great, congrats on the quarter again.
Paramesh Gopi
Okay, thanks Chris. Thank you, operator. I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and our customers and shareholders and their ongoing support. Thanks for joining us today. Have a good evening.

Q. What are the top 3 innovative trends Applied Micro sees 
                  in ESDM technology?

A. Consumerization and Social Media driving the 
                  electronics industry. The growing use of video, the explosion 
                  of Internet connections and the number of connected devices, 
                  spiralling bandwidth requirements and increased use of social 
                  media applications are all contributing to the rise of the 
                  cloud computing as applications become more data intensive and 
                  less compute intensive. 

                  The traditional data center needs remain the same as before 
                  but the move to cloud is driving a consolidation of even 
                  traditional data centers to captive clouds. This changes the 
                  technology requirements for computing servers as well as 
                  brings about a massive change in the connectivity 
                  infrastructure. For example, where the market took a decade to 
                  switch from 1G to 10G bandwidth on the connectivity side, it 
                  has taken roughly only two years to move from 10G to 40G and 
                  it appears that 40G deployment may be very short lived as 100G 
                  solutions are already under late stage development.

                  Power efficiency is not merely a green initiative any more; it 
                  impacts the bottom line of businesses directly. Hence upfront 
                  awareness and analysis of total cost of ownership (TCO) drives 
                  technology solutions.

                  At Applied Micro we see these trends as the primary engine of 
                  growth for the company. By designing devices that deliver the 
                  compute performance to meet todays data center needs with 
                  dramatically lower power consumption, we will dramatically 
                  lower TCO.


Q. What part does India play in the overall technology 
                  strategy and marketing strategy of Applied Micro.

A. AppliedMicros two design centers in India play a 
                  significant role in the companys overall technology strategy. 
                  As a semiconductor company, our centers in Pune and now in 
                  Bangalore offer full design, verification and validation 
                  capabilities for our computing and connectivity chips. This is 
                  one of the most important aspects of getting leading-edge 
                  designs out into a competitive market. If we misstep in this 
                  process, we stand to offer our competitors an open door. We 
                  are expanding in Bangalore partially because of increased 
                  demand for our products, but mostly because our design center 
                  in Pune has proven that we can assemble a team of engineers to 
                  realize our state of the art products that allows us to 
                  compete globally.

                  Further, with several of our global & local customers having 
                  R&D and systems development presence in Bangalore it allows us 
                  to work closely with them to enable design-in and bring-up of 
                  their products with our chips.


Q. With the Government of India giving complete support to 
                  the manufacturing ecosystem, in terms of various policies, 
                  what is the stand taken by Applied Micro

A. The Government of India has been working closely 
                  with the industry and the IESA to formulate policies to give an 
                  impetus to the manufacturing ecosystem in India. Given the 
                  critical impact of ESDM in India it would be foolhardy to 
                  ignore it. At the same time, we need to recognize that success 
                  in manufacturing requires a lot of things to come together - 
                  infrastructure, raw materials, transportation, skilled labour 
                  and favourable tax policies. The government has a huge role to 
                  play in influencing all of these. In the end, the perception 
                  about India as a manufacturing destination would need to 
                  change just like it did for software and electronic design 
                  years back. Applied Micro is very happy to work with industry 
                  bodies like the IESA and the various governmental departments 
                  to help bring about this change.
                  As a fabless semiconductor company, our core output is 
                  semiconductor and electronic design and we are expanding our 
                  operations here in India to do that. As this process evolves, 
                  our local presence strengthens the manufacturing ecosystem. 
                  Today, just like the rest of our industry, our products are 
                  manufactured in the far east, far from where we do our 
                  designs. If additional competitive options are available to 
                  us, for example in India, we will be happy to consider those; 
                  and so would the rest of the fabless industry.


Q. What are the critical challenges facing companies 
                  looking to develop or expand existing semiconductor companies 
                  operations in India?

A. The challenges in India are much the same as all 
                  over the world where semiconductor operations take place: How 
                  do you hire the most talented engineers for your team and 
                  retain them for the long-term? We feel AppliedMicro was quite 
                  successful in doing so in Pune and that is why we are opening 
                  up our new center in Bangalore. Now that more and more 
                  international corporations have discovered India and its rich 
                  pool of engineering talent, it has become a lot more 
                  competitive. But the favorable assets that Indias engineers 
                  bring to the table still make it favorable to establish roots 
                  here and compete for talent.


Q. How do you place the competency of Indian product 
                  companies as compared with MNCs? 

A. Indias highly educated and industrious work force, 
                  and positive business climate have contributed greatly to the 
                  emergence the countrys output. However, while India has 
                  produced great thinkers, philosophers and scientists who have 
                  contributed to the progress of the whole human race, "product" 
                  orientation has never been a focus of the people and the 
                  country in the past. Globalization has brought the realization 
                  about how important "product" focus is in today's world. And 
                  businesses and entrepreneurs in India are starting to create 
                  products that the markets would accept. It might take some 
                  time for successes to emerge but the education, intelligence, 
                  focus and persistence would pay off; it always does.


Q. What would be the key market drivers in 2012? 

A. As a company we see a tectonic shift taking place in 
                  the computing infrastructure as we know it. This is akin to 
                  the major shifts that happened earlier, only perhaps much 
                  bigger. We moved from mainframe based computing to department 
                  level servers, and then to powerful desktop workstations. 
                  Then, with the introduction of PCs, computing came into the 
                  homes of people from being exclusively in the business 
                  offices. With the Internet and mobile phone, it has now moved 
                  into the pockets of the masses. As can been seen, the edge of 
                  inclusion moved from business to the home and now to the 
                  individual. It was only a matter of time that the explosion of 
                  applications like social media happened. The computing 
                  infrastructure to support this explosive growth efficiently is 
                  now rapidly evolving. 

                  Cloud Computing data centers, explosive growth of video and 
                  social media applications, spiralling demand for network 
                  bandwidth, the drive toward lower-power to reduce total cost 
                  of ownership are all key drivers.


Q. How do you see the Indian engineering education 
                  scenario? What do you think are its strengths? 

A. We see legions of highly talented engineers 
                  graduating from Indian Universities who come to work for us 
                  and produce world-class results. The "application" orientation 
                  of fresh graduates could be better but we see that the 
                  industry, academia and government are aware of this and are 
                  taking steps to best address it. Wasn't it one of the first 
                  focus areas taken up by IESA when it was founded?


Q. How does your company plan to leverage the unique needs 
                  of India in the various market verticals?

A. As a fabless semiconductor company Applied Micro 
                  creates chips in the computing and connectivity domains. These 
                  chips are implemented by our customers in their systems 
                  products which are then sold and deployed all over the world 
                  including India. It would not be immodest to say that we are 
                  already a critical part of India's telecom and Internet 
                  backbone infrastructure through our customers' products, for 
                  example. 

                  As we work with our customers in India we realize that they 
                  see some unique needs in India that they need to address with 
                  their systems products. And several of these companies, 
                  including MNCs, have ramped up their Indian presence to define 
                  and develop these products from their development centers in 
                  India. We are closely working with them to create products 
                  that will satisfy the unique needs of India.


Q. How is the regulatory environment in India impacting the 
                  Indian semiconductor industry? 

A. The regulatory environment is allowing the Indian 
                  semiconductor company to grow at a healthy rate from the 
                  AppliedMicro perspective. China is emerging as a significant 
                  player in this industry but our company keeps coming back to 
                  India to expand because we find the work force highly 
                  motivated and highly educated. The regulatory environment has 
                  not caused us to alter our expansion efforts.


Q. How does Applied Micro connect Cloud to ESDM industry in 
                  India. 

A. The major growth in information technology industry 
                  is shifting from compute intensive applications to 
                  unstructured data and even more social networking based 
                  applications. The cloud computing model is emerging as a 
                  result of these trends. With the rapid consumerisation of 
                  computing, there is a huge opportunity to create applications 
                  to address the varied needs of the individual consumers. It 
                  presents a huge opportunity to both software and hardware 
                  developers in India to create solutions for the Cloud market. 
                  Being locally present, the local creators are best placed to 
                  understand the needs and define and develop these solutions, 
                  not just for direct use by the consumer but also for the 
                  backbone Cloud infrastructure required to support it. Applied 
                  Micro's local presence in India is critical for the same 
                  reasons.

                  The ESDM industry is naturally aligned with the cloud 
                  computing model and it will thrive as the cloud becomes more 
                  pervasive in everyday use.



About the author

                  Dr Paramesh Gopi 
                  President & Chief Executive Officer
                  Applied Micro Circuits Corporation

                  Paramesh Gopi is President & Chief Executive Officer of 
                  Applied Micro Circuits Corp, a role he has commanded since May 
                  2009 after joining the company in 2008. Under Dr. Gopis 
                  leadership, AppliedMicro is transforming into a mid-cap 
                  semiconductor company. In fact, no other small cap 
                  semiconductor company is developing and introducing as many 
                  groundbreaking new products as AppliedMicro.

                  Under his leadership, AppliedMicro has set a course for 
                  exponential growth by re-aligning its semiconductor product 
                  portfolio to converge on the cloud computing data center, one 
                  of the most vibrant technology opportunities to emerge over 
                  the last decade. Dr. Gopis vision has guided AppliedMicro to 
                  develop the revolutionary 64-bit ARM processor-based 
                  server-on-a-chip to disrupt the status quo in the cloud 
                  services data center market. The X-Gene platform combines high 
                  performance computing and low power consumption in just the 
                  right quantities to bring game-changing reductions in total 
                  cost of ownership as demand for data center services continues 
                  to grow at an explosive pace.

                  Leveraging AppliedMicros core competencies and resources, Dr. 
                  Gopi reinvigorated the companys existing business lines and 
                  drove an order-of-magnitude increase in new product 
                  introductions over the last fiscal year, a cadence that will 
                  generate upwards of $200 million in new revenue over the next 
                  30 months.

                  Dr. Gopis passion for capitalizing on emerging market 
                  opportunities was established before joining AppliedMicro as 
                  he contributed to the development of Apples iPhone, Sonys 
                  Playstation and the wireless ecosystem. Before joining the 
                  company, he served in executive management positions at both 
                  Marvell and Mindspeed Technologies/Conexant Systems.

                  He holds a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering at 
                  the University of California, Irvine. Gopi is the recipient of 
                  the 2011 Lauds & Laurels Distinguished Alumnus Award from The 
                  Henry Samueli School of Engineering at UC, Irvine.
