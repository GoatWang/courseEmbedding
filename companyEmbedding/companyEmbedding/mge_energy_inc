Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)
How do I notify MGE Energy that my address changed?
To reduce potential delay in receiving your shareholder mailings, keep your address information current. You can update the address information:

By using the tear-off portion of your account statement.
Online in My Shareholder Account.
By contacting Shareholder Services.

May I consolidate my accounts?
If you have more than one account for the same registered owner(s), you may be able to combine the accounts to:

Receive one dividend check.
Avoid multiple mailings.
Contact Shareholder Services with your account information.

Is direct dividend deposit available?
We can deposit dividends directly to your financial institution account. We'll send your dividend by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) directly to your designated bank account on the payable date. To sign up for direct deposit, please send Shareholder Services a completed Dividend Deposit Authorization Form [69 kB PDF].
When are dividends paid?
Dividends are typically paid quarterly on March 15, June 15, Sept. 15 and Dec. 15.
These dividends are paid to shareholders who own shares at the close of business on the dividend record date: March 1, June 1, Sept. 1 and Dec. 1.
What do I do if a dividend check is lost or stolen?
Contact us immediately. We'll issue a:

Stop payment order against the original check.
Replacement check.

Once a dividend check is replaced, the original check is no longer valid and must not be cashed if received. The replacement check stub will list the invalid checks.
How can I replace a lost or stolen stock certificate?
Please notify Shareholder Services immediately if your stock certificates are lost or stolen. We will:

Place a stop transfer on the certificate.
Send you the necessary forms for issuing a replacement certificate.
Charge you approximately 3% of the market value of the shares (minimum of $10) to replace the certificate.

Read the instructions included on the Stock Transfer Form [121 kB PDF]

Fee information can be found on the NetBasis Website.
To use NetBasis, you will need to supply the following information:

Your original purchase/acquisition dates.
Number of shares acquired.
Number of shares sold.
Sale dates.

NetBasis will then be able to supply you with your cost-basis, gain/loss and sale proceeds, and current status of your investment.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
