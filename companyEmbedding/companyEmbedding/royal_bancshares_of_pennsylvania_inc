Excluding expenses directly related to the merger with Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation of $162 thousand, net income attributable to the Company was $3.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2017.Net income attributable to the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $4.8 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to $4.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Excluding expenses directly related to the merger with Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation of $405 thousand, net income attributable to the Company was $5.2 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2017.Kevin Tylus, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, noted, "The continued improvement in the net interest margin contributed to our second quarter results. We also significantly reduced our non-performing assets by 28% during the most recent quarter and 34% during 2017. While we are in the midst of our merger planning activities with Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation, we remain equally focused on the daily operations of the bank and serving our customers." The merger with Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation was approved by the Company's shareholders on May 24, 2017. The merger is subject to certain additional closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.Highlights for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 included:Balance Sheet Trends:At June 30, 2017, total assets were $808.8 million and decreased $23.7 million, or 2.9%, from $832.5 million at December 31, 2016.Total loans were $605.7 million at June 30, 2017, an increase of $3.7 million, or 0.6%, from $602.0 million at December 31, 2016.Total deposits were $622.8 million at June 30, 2017, a decrease of $6.7 million, or 1.1%, from $629.5 million at December 31, 2016. Asset Quality:The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans improved significantly and was 0.73% at June 30, 2017 compared to 1.08% at March 31, 2017 and 1.00% at December 31, 2016.Non-performing loans of $4.4 million at June 30, 2017 decreased $2.3 million, or 34.1%, from $6.7 million at March 31, 2017, and decreased $1.6 million, or 26.5%, from $6.0 million at December 31, 2016.The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets continues to improve and was 0.78% at June 30, 2017 compared to 1.05% at March 31, 2017 and 1.15% at December 31, 2016.Non-performing assets of $6.3 million at June 30, 2017 decreased $2.5 million, or 28.1%, from $8.8 million at March 31, 2017, and decreased $3.2 million, or 33.5% from $9.5 million at December 31, 2016. Other real estate owned ("OREO") has declined $1.6 million, or 45.4%, during the first six months of 2017 mostly due to sales of the properties.For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded a provision to the allowance for loan and lease losses of $57 thousand and $354 thousand, respectively, compared to $197 thousand and $409 thousand for the same periods in 2016, respectively. The 2017 provision was primarily attributable to the leasing subsidiary. Income Statement and Other Highlights:The return on average assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was 1.46% and 1.17%, respectively, compared to 1.02% and 1.06% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.The return on average equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was 21.51% and 17.16%, respectively, compared to 11.55% and 11.77% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.At June 30, 2017, the Company's Tier 1 leverage and Total Risk Based Capital ratios were 9.13% and 14.27%, respectively, compared to 8.49% and 13.30%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 8.90% at June 30, 2017 compared to 7.99% at December 31, 2016.Net interest income increased $1.1 million, or 16.9%, from $6.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $7.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Net interest income increased $1.6 million, or 12.5%, from $12.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $14.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The growth in net interest income was impacted by the growth in average interest-earning assets coupled with interest received from the redemption of a non-performing tax certificate and was partially offset by an increase in the average rate paid on average interest-bearing deposits and borrowings.The net interest margin was 3.84% for the second quarter of 2017 compared to 3.41% for the comparable period in 2016. The net interest margin was 3.72% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 3.46% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest margin was directly related to an increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets due to a change in the composition of such assets coupled with interest received from the redemption of a non-performing tax certificate.Non-interest income for the second quarter of 2017 was $943 thousand and decreased $130 thousand from $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2016. Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $1.5 million and decreased $826 thousand from $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily related to net gains on the sales of investment securities which declined $459 thousand quarter versus quarter and $826 thousand year over year.Non-interest expense was $5.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $5.0 million for the same period in 2016 and increased $124 thousand. Contributing to the increase in non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $162 thousand in merger related expenses. Non-interest expense was $10.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $10.3 million for the same period in 2016 and increased $279 thousand. Contributing to the increase in non-interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $405 thousand in merger related expenses. About Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc.

Ishares Russell Mid Cap* (IWR) presently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 74.23. Spotting these patterns and watching for momentum shifts can be a highly useful tool for any trader or investor. The CCI was created to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Many traders will use the ADX in combination with other indicators in order to help formulate trading strategies. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory.Reading levels close to +100 point to potential overbought range while a reading close to -100 would indicate possible oversold territory.Moving average indicators are used widely for stock analysis.Investors may be taking a look at some additional technical numbers on shares of CGI Group Inc (GIB). Currently, Horizons S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF (HXE.TO) has a 200-day MA of 20.43, and a 50-day of 19.25.Shifting gears to the Relative Strength Index, the 14-day RSI is now sitting at 49.38, the 7-day is 43.72, and the 3-day is now at 30.95 for Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania Inc (RBPAA). As a momentum indicator, the Williams R% may be used with other technicals to help define a specific trend. Wilder introduced RSI in his book "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems" which was published in 1978. The RSI is computed base on the speed and direction of a stock's price movement.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) oscillates between 0 and 100.

				Moving average indicators are commonly tracked by technical stock analysts. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal.Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. iShares US Preferred Stock ETF (PFF)'s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R now sits at -70.97. In general, if the reading goes above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally.Now let's take a look at how the fundamentals are stacking up for iShares MSCI Mexico Investable Market Index Fund (EWW). The ADX alone measures trend strength but not direction. The RSI value will always move between 0 and 100. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool.The 14-day ADX for Horizons S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF (HXE.TO) presently sits at 36.48. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend.Ishares Ftse Kld 400 Social Index Fund (DSI) shares are being closely watched as the Rank Correlation Indicator has shown an upward 3 bar near-term trend, indicating that a reversal might be near. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. Finding continued success in the stock market may entail keeping the portfolio balanced, but also finding the courage to get in when necessary, or get out when needed. Every investor wants their trades to be profitable, and doing that little extra piece of homework could be just what the finance doctor ordered for staying on top of the stock market. Fresh buying opportunities can surface at any moment, and the prepared trader may be poised to take full advantage.

Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc. Reports Second Quarter ProfitJuly 21, 2015 4:30 EDT



Commercial Loan and Customer Growth Produce Results Ahead of Last Year; Retail Strategy Boosted by Branch Acquisition Announcement
BALA CYNWYD, PA—(Marketwired – Jul 21, 2015) – Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc. (“Company”) (NASDAQ: RBPAA), parent company of Royal Bank America (“Royal Bank”), is pleased to report net income attributable to the Company of $1.5 million, or $.03 per diluted share, and $3.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $.04 per diluted share, and $2.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for 2015 were impacted by the increase in average common shares outstanding as a result of the private placement and shareholders’ rights offering which closed in the third quarter of 2014.
Kevin Tylus, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, noted, “Loan and customer growth, coupled with the continuing trend in improved credit quality, positively contributed to second quarter and 2015 year to date earnings. Portfolio growth from our leasing subsidiary also added to earnings. Our multi-faceted retail plan to attract and retain consumer deposits continued with the relocation from Jenkintown to the bustling new Willow Grove branch site. And upon regulatory approval of our entry into contiguous Delaware County, PA, the acquisition of our new branch in the county seat of Media will add approximately $38 million, or 7%, to our deposit base and $10 million, or 2%, in commercial loans.”
The Company continues its focus on modernizing the ways customers can access its products and services. A new custom branded “smart phone” application is now available and provides a simpler on-line banking experience, while on-line loan applications are increasing. The suite of cash management products, together with improved physical locations and the Princeton, NJ loan production office, are helping to drive the growth within the Company’s attractive geography.
Highlights for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 included:
• Total loans were $447.6 million at June 30, 2015, an increase of $29.0 million, or 6.9%, from $418.7 million at March 31, 2015, and an increase of $32.5 million, or 7.8%, from $415.1 million at December 31, 2014. The majority of the increase was in the commercial real estate portfolio which grew $25.6 million, or 11.1%, from $230.5 million at March 31, 2015 to $256.1 million at June 30, 2015.
• Non-performing loans of $5.4 million at June 30, 2015 decreased $3.0 million, or 35.5%, from $8.4 million at March 31, 2015 and decreased $4.4 million, or 45.1% from $9.8 million at December 31, 2014. The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 1.20%, 1.99%, and 2.36% at June 30, 2015, March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Excluding tax liens, the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.99%, 1.82%, and 1.99% at June 30, 2015, March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
• Non-performing assets of $15.9 million at June 30, 2015 decreased $3.0 million, or 15.8%, from $18.9 million at March 31, 2015 and decreased $3.7 million, or 18.8%, from December 31, 2014. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets was 2.19%, 2.61%, and 2.67% at June 30, 2015, March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Excluding tax liens, the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.67%, 1.11%, and 1.19% at June 30, 2015, March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. The purposeful downsizing of the tax lien business, which is not core to Royal Bank’s strategy, has seen a favorable reduction from a high of over $100 million in tax lien assets in 2009 to less than $18.0 million in assets at June 30, 2015.
• The return on average assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 was 0.81% and 0.85%, respectively, compared to 0.75% and 0.79% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014.
• The return on average equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 was 9.03% and 9.56%, respectively, compared to 10.35% and 11.13% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014. The return on average equity was impacted by the increase in average common equity as a result of the private placement and shareholders’ rights offering which closed in the third quarter of 2014.
• At June 30, 2015, the Company’s Tier 1 leverage and Total Risk Based Capital ratios were 12.5% and 18.8%, respectively, compared to 11.9% and 19.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2014. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.2% at June 30, 2015.
• Net interest income increased $76,000, or 0.7%, from $11.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 to $11.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, but declined $107,000, or 1.9%, from $5.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 to $5.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the quarterly net interest income was related to a decline in the average yields earned on average investment securities and average loans, which was partially offset by an increase in the average loan balances.
• The net interest margin was 3.26% for the second quarter of 2015 compared to 3.25% for the comparable period in 2014 and was 3.33% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to 3.24% for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The six month increase of 9 basis points was directly related to an increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets.
• Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 was $1.3 million and increased $467,000, or 57.2%, from $816,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $2.1 million and increased $542,000, or 34.1%, from $1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increases for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015 were related to increases of $293,000 and $480,000, respectively, in net gains on the sale of investment securities. During 2015, the Company sold investment securities to fund the loan growth.

The net interest margin was 3.72% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 3.46% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
