	StoneCastle Financial makes long-term, passive, non-control investments in community banks seeking capital for organic growth, acquisitions, share repurchases and other refinancing activities.

Investment Objectives

	StoneCastle Financial’s primary investment objective is to provide stockholders with current income, and, to a lesser extent capital appreciation. We achieve our investment objectives through investments in preferred equity, subordinated debt, convertible securities and, to a lesser extent, common equity primarily in the U.S. community bank sector.

Together with banks, we refer to these types of companies as banking-related and intend, under normal circumstances, to invest at least 80% of the value of our net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in such businesses. There is no guarantee that we will achieve our investment objective.

Company Overview

	We intend to pursue our investment objective by investing principally in public and privately-held community banks located throughout the United States. For the purpose of our investment objectives and this prospectus, we define "community bank" to mean banks, savings associations and their holding companies with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets that serve local markets. As of March 31, 2013, the community banking sector is a highly fragmented $2.9 trillion industry, comprised of over 6,900 banks located throughout the United States, including underserved rural, semi-rural, suburban and other niche markets. Community banks generally have simple, straightforward business models and geographically concentrated credit exposure. Community banks typically do not have exposure to non-U.S. credit and are focused on lending to borrowers in their distinct communities. As a result, we believe that community banks frequently have a better understanding of the local businesses they finance than larger banking organizations. Many of these community banks are well established, having been in business on average for more than 75 years, and have survived many economic cycles, including the most recent financial crisis. We expect to create a portfolio of securities focused on the bank market, with an emphasis on community banks, through investments in numerous issuers differentiated by asset sizes, business models and geographies.

	We intend to create a portfolio primarily comprised of securities issued by community banks by investing in public and privately held banks, initially in amounts ranging between approximately $5 million to $20 million each (unless our investment size is otherwise constrained or expanded by applicable law, rule or regulation).

Our Advisor will monitor our portfolio companies and market concentrations and may adjust its underwriting criteria based on market conditions and portfolio concentrations. Our Advisor's monitoring operations will include sensitivity analyses to determine the effects of changes in market conditions on our asset portfolio. These analyses may include, among other things, simulations of changes in interest rates, changes in economic activity and other events that would affect the forecasted performance of our assets.

Distribution Policy

Consistent with our primary investment objective of providing stockholders with current income, we intend to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount, and on a timely basis, sufficient to obtain and maintain our status as a regulated investment company ("RIC"). Investment company taxable income includes, among other items, dividends, interest and the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, reduced by deductible expenses. We will pay all dividends at the discretion of our board of directors, and the dividends we pay will depend on a number of factors, including: distribution requirements under the Investment Company Act and to maintain our status as a RIC, our financial condition, general business conditions, actual results of operations, the timing of the deployment of our capital, debt service requirements, availability of cash distributions, our operating expenses, any contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions by us to our stockholders including debt covenants imposed by lenders to the Company, and other factors our board of directors in its discretion may deem relevant.

Company Overview

	We intend to pursue our investment objective by investing principally in public and privately-held community banks located throughout the United States. For the purpose of our investment objectives and this prospectus, we define "community bank" to mean banks, savings associations and their holding companies with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets that serve local markets. As of March 31, 2013, the community banking sector is a highly fragmented $2.9 trillion industry, comprised of over 6,900 banks located throughout the United States, including underserved rural, semi-rural, suburban and other niche markets. Community banks generally have simple, straightforward business models and geographically concentrated credit exposure. Community banks typically do not have exposure to non-U.S. credit and are focused on lending to borrowers in their distinct communities. As a result, we believe that community banks frequently have a better understanding of the local businesses they finance than larger banking organizations. Many of these community banks are well established, having been in business on average for more than 75 years, and have survived many economic cycles, including the most recent financial crisis. We expect to create a portfolio of securities focused on the bank market, with an emphasis on community banks, through investments in numerous issuers differentiated by asset sizes, business models and geographies.

	We intend to create a portfolio primarily comprised of securities issued by community banks by investing in public and privately held banks, initially in amounts ranging between approximately $5 million to $20 million each (unless our investment size is otherwise constrained or expanded by applicable law, rule or regulation).

Distribution Policy

Consistent with our primary investment objective of providing stockholders with current income, we intend to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount, and on a timely basis, sufficient to obtain and maintain our status as a regulated investment company ("RIC"). Investment company taxable income includes, among other items, dividends, interest and the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, reduced by deductible expenses. We will pay all dividends at the discretion of our board of directors, and the dividends we pay will depend on a number of factors, including: distribution requirements under the Investment Company Act and to maintain our status as a RIC, our financial condition, general business conditions, actual results of operations, the timing of the deployment of our capital, debt service requirements, availability of cash distributions, our operating expenses, any contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions by us to our stockholders including debt covenants imposed by lenders to the Company, and other factors our board of directors in its discretion may deem relevant.

Investors
Our primary objective is to provide our investors with current income and capital appreciation primarily through investment in U.S. community banks



Overview
Holdings
Investor Relations







The primary investment objective of StoneCastle Financial Corp. (Nasdaq: BANX) is current income. The  secondary objective is capital appreciation.

Philosophy: We are a disciplined investor focused on investing in U.S. community banks. StoneCastle Financial Corp's investment philosophy is to minimize the risk of loss of principal while capitalizing on opportunity in the community banking sector.
As a value investor, we seek to invest in companies that have demonstrated a long history of generating significant free cash flow, and at prices well below long-term intrinsic value. We seek investments where there is a significantly higher probability of upside potential than downside risk.
Preservation of Capital: We expect a significant portion of our investments to be made in the form of income generating preferred stock with warrants or equity conversion rights.  We therefore seek to minimize downside risk by investing in banks that exhibit the potential for long-term stability. We focus on minimizing the risk of losses by using StoneCastle Financial Corp's disciplined and proven underwriting process when providing capital to community banks. We target:
    • long-term investments in established companies;
    • disciplined credit underwriting processes and positive regulatory relationships;
    • companies with stable balance sheets, lending in attractive markets with solid fundamentals; and
    • experienced management teams with exceptional track records and ties to their local markets.

This Stock Has A 8.24% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

		StoneCastle Financial Direct Capital Investment
	











Page ContentStoneCastle Financial ("BANX") is the first public investment company specifically established to invest in healthy community banks. StoneCastle Financial allows banks to expand their investor base to include a knowledgeable bank investor and efficiently receive the capital they need to grow. ​​

StoneCastle Financial’s Senior Management team is comprised of long-term investors in community banks and is prepared to invest immediately in well-positioned banks and savings institutions.​
 
Investment types and features include, but are not limited to:
Non-control investments from as little as $2 million
Preferred stock, debt and, to a lesser extent,  common equity – depending on individual bank need and situation
Pricing – each bank negotiates their own cost of capital with StoneCastle Financial​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
 ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​









 New Bank Issued Subordinated Debt Opportunity 



**NEW POOL FORMING FOR CLOSING SUMMER 2017**Ever since the financial crisis, raising capital has been difficult for community banks, especially the smallest ones. With these banks in mind, StoneCastle Financial Corp. has developed a structured product that enables community banks to pool together to raise needed capital at relatively low cost.Following the successful closing on October 15, 2015, of a $250 million subordinated loan transaction that consisted of 35 banks across 24 states​, StoneCastle Financial is seeking immediate opportunities to invest in community bank issued subordinated debt at competitive rates on a first-come-first-served basis. 

The capital, which can be counted as Tier 2 capital qualifying subordinated loan, will be priced between 6.75% and 6.99%. This presents an ideal opportunity to refinance higher cost SBLF preferred stock around the time of step up in dividend rate. Learn more. 

Take advantage of this great opportunity! Contact ABA's Helen Sullivan​ at1-800-BANKERS, ext. 5167 today.
