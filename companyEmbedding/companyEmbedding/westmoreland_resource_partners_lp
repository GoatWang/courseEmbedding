The completion of the GP acquisition and the Contribution provide Westmoreland with a platform to implement a value-creating drop-down strategy, pursuant to which it intends to periodically contribute certain U.S. and Canadian coal assets to the MLP in exchange for a combination of cash and additional limited partner interests. Westmoreland expects these transactions to unlock value that is inherent in Westmoreland’s stable cash flow-generating business model, to the benefit of both its stakeholders and the MLP’s unitholders. The MLP will continue to operate as a stand-alone, publicly traded master limited partnership, with Westmoreland owning 77% of the fully diluted limited partner interests.
“We are pleased that these strategic transactions have come to a successful close and excited for Westmoreland to enter the MLP space,” stated Keith E. Alessi, Westmoreland’s Chief Executive Officer. “We believe our strategy with respect to the MLP will help ensure our continued long-term growth.”
“Oxford is very pleased that it has been able to join with Westmoreland,” said Oxford’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Charles C. Ungurean. “This is the culmination of our efforts to bring increased value to our unitholders. We believe that this represents a great opportunity for our company, unitholders, employees and customers, as well as providing a MLP vehicle for Westmoreland and its shareholders. This represents a win for all stakeholders.”
Westmoreland paid a total of $30.0 million in cash to acquire the GP, and received 4,512,500 common units of the MLP (on a post-split basis following the previously disclosed 12-to-1 reverse split of the MLP’s common and general partner units) as consideration for the Contribution. The closing of these transactions followed the successful restructuring of both Westmoreland’s and the MLP’s debt arrangements, as well as the approval by the MLP’s public unitholders of the Contribution and the MLP’s equity restructuring through certain previously announced amendments to its partnership agreement.
In connection with the closing, the MLP’s name was changed to Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP (“Westmoreland LP”) and the name of the GP was changed to Westmoreland Resources GP, LLC. The common units of Westmoreland LP will trade on the NYSE under the symbol “WMLP”.
On January 1, 2015, Westmoreland also completed its acquisition of Buckingham Coal Company, LLC, an Ohio-based coal supplier, for a total cash purchase price of $34.0 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Separately, an affiliate of Westmoreland entered into a five-year coal supply agreement with AEP Generation Resources Inc. (“AEP”), which includes an obligation to purchase a minimum of 5.5 million tons of coal.
“Westmoreland is happy to implement a long-term supply relationship with AEP,” said Mr. Alessi. “We were able to realize significant cost savings through this acquisition and we expect our supply agreement will provide additional value to our shareholders,” he added.

Reclamation
Environmental stewardship is at the core of our business philosophy. We produce more surface-mined coal than any other company in Ohio and have an award-winning history of mine reclamation.
We continue to partner with state universities, the U.S. Department of Interior Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, the Ohio Division of Wildlife and Forestry, and The American Chestnut Foundation to ensure a sterling record for responsible environmental practices.
We are committed to minimizing our environmental impact during the mining process. To minimize this impact, we plan and monitor each phase of our mining projects and perform reclamation activities on a continuous basis as our mining activities progress. As of December 31, 2013, we had $9.6 million in cash deposits supporting $37 million in surety bonds outstanding to secure performance of our reclamation obligations.
Environmental Awards
Our recent reclamation awards include:
2011 National Award for Excellence in Surface Coal Mining from the U.S. Department of Interior in recognition for (then) Oxford’s exemplary reclamation efforts. We was one of only two companies that received this award, which goes to companies exhibiting the best reclamation practices in the country.
Read the full press release (PDF)
Good Neighbor Award recognizing Oxford (prior to becoming Westmoreland) for working closely with local communities during reclamation efforts. Westmoreland allowed multiple groups to use its Jockey Hollow West site as an outdoor classroom for reforestation research and monitoring and training for coal mine inspectors. Westmoreland was the only coal mining operator to be recognized with this award.

Ohio Coal Facts — Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP

Ohio Coal Facts
History of Ohio Coal Mining
Coal mining in Ohio began around 1800, with reported production amounting to 100 tons of coal mined from Jefferson County. Since 1800, over 3 billion tons of coal have been mined in Ohio. Ohio’s coal production has experienced a history of great fluctuation. During the first half of the 19th century, coal production never exceeded one million tons annually. Coal was cut and loaded entirely by hand and transported to local markets by means of wagons, carts, and flatboats. As Ohio transformed into an industrial state in the late 1800s, it became one of the largest coal-producing and coal-consuming states in the nation. During World War I, Ohio’s coal industry realized production levels that would not be seen again until the 1960s. In 1918, Ohio’s coal work force swelled to its greatest level of more than 50,000 individuals.
Today, Ohio’s coal industry employs up to 3,000 individuals. This decline is due in part to decreased production and technological advances. However, these advances have allowed productivity rates to soar, reaching an astonishing average of about 6 tons per miner per hour, or 48 tons in a single 8-hour day.
During the interwar period coal production sagged, but quickly regained momentum following World War II. This time period saw the advent of large, efficient excavating equipment, new drilling techniques, and newly developed explosives making earthmoving operations possible. Thus, surface mining operations became an economic alternative to underground mining. Surface mining involves the excavation of all the rock and soil above the desired coal seam, exposing it at the surface. With the rise of surface mining, coal production steadily increased until 1970. Since this time, production has decreased. This decline is due in part to increased transportation costs, but primarily to the significant impact of the Federal Clean Air Act, which placed stringent controls on emissions, particularly SO2 emissions, from coal-fired power plants.
Ohio Coal Facts

Ohio ranks 4th nationally in coal consumption, trailing only Texas, Indiana, and Illinois
Ohio ranks 4th nationally in industrial energy consumption
Ohio ranks 7th nationally in coal reserves
Ohio ranks 13th nationally in coal production
Approximately 90 percent of Ohio’s electricity is generated by coal, compared to 50 percent nationwide and 40 percent worldwide
Ohio is home to 26 major coal-based electricity generating plants
In 1980, the average miner produced 1.93 tons per hour – today, the number has risen to 7.10 tons per hour, largely through technological advancements
Coal is currently mined in 16 Ohio counties and has been mined in 32 total counties since mining began in the early 19th century
57 percent of mined Ohio coal is transported by trains, with the balance being trucked and barged

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP (NYSE:   WMLP, "Westmoreland LP") today announced that the record date and distribution date have been set for Westmoreland LP's previously announced "25% unit dividend" as a one-time special distribution (the "Special Distribution") of common units of Westmoreland LP ("Westmoreland LP Units").  The Special Distribution is for an aggregate of approximately 202,184 Westmoreland LP Units, representing an approximately 25% unit dividend per Westmoreland LP Unit, payable to public unitholders on a pro rata basis.  The Special Distribution is being effected as part of the completion of the series of transactions involving Westmoreland Coal Company previously announced on January 2, 2015.
The record date for the Special Distribution will be January 27, 2015 (the "Record Date"). The distribution of Westmoreland LP Units is expected to occur on January 30, 2015 (the "Distribution Date").  The transfer agent will not distribute any fractional Westmoreland LP Units or compensation in lieu thereof.  Each fractional Westmoreland LP Unit will be rounded to the nearest whole Westmoreland LP Unit (and a 0.5 Westmoreland LP Unit will be rounded to the next higher Westmoreland LP Unit).
Holders of Westmoreland LP Units on the Record Date are not required to take any action in order to receive Westmoreland LP Units in connection with the Special Distribution. Westmoreland LP common unitholders entitled to receive Westmoreland LP Units in connection with the Special Distribution will either receive a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership of the Westmoreland LP Units distributed to them in the Special Distribution or their brokerage accounts will be credited for the Westmoreland LP Units distributed to them in the Special Distribution.
