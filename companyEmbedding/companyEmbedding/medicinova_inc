About the Company
  





MediciNova, Inc. is a publicly-traded biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and developing novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs with a specific focus on the U.S. market. Through strategic alliances primarily with Japanese pharmaceutical companies, MediciNova holds rights to a diversified portfolio of clinical and preclinical product candidates, each of which MediciNova believes has a well-characterized and differentiated therapeutic profile, attractive commercial potential and patent assets having claims of commercially adequate scope. MediciNova’s pipeline includes clinical-stage compounds for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD, progressive multiple sclerosis, methamphetamine addiction, neuropathic pain, asthma, interstitial cystitis, and solid tumor cancers. MediciNova’s current strategy is to focus on MN-166 (ibudilast) for neurological disorders, MN-221 for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma, and MN-001 for NASH. MediciNova may pursue development independently or establish a strategic collaboration to support further development of its programs. MediciNova will seek to monetize its other product candidates at key value inflection points. MediciNova’s executive management team has extensive global development, regulatory, commercial and financial experience, and manages its international clinical and manufacturing operations through efficient and cost-effective utilization of contract research organizations. Headquartered in La Jolla, California, MediciNova has approximately 15 employees.

Business Development
Our Strategy
  





Our goal is to build a sustainable biopharmaceutical business through the successful development and commercialization of differentiated products for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs in high-value therapeutic areas. Key elements of our strategy are to:

Concentrate on development of our prioritized product candidates, MN-221, MN-166 (ibudilast), and MN-001. We may either pursue the development and commercialization of these product candidates ourselves or enter into strategic alliances with larger pharmaceutical companies. We intend to actively pursue strategic collaborations to draw on the development, regulatory and commercialization expertise and financial resources of larger biotechnology and pharmaceutical partners.
Maximize the value of the remainder of our diversified pipeline of existing product candidates. We will strategically conduct development activities on the remainder of our existing product candidates, to the extent that we deem any further activities necessary, to maximize their value while pursuing a variety of initiatives to monetize these product candidates.
Opportunistically in-license additional product candidates through our global industry relationships. Over the long term, we intend to expand our pipeline of in-licensed product candidates by continuing to cultivate and strengthen our business relationships with pharmaceutical companies in Japan and other markets. We believe that additional diversification and expansion of our pipeline of product candidates will help maximize our commercial opportunities and mitigate the risks inherent in drug development.
Selectively add commercial capabilities as our product development programs mature. To ensure our ability to build a sustainable business, we plan to selectively add commercial capabilities to our management team to support our evolution into a commercial entity as our product development programs mature. We may develop our own marketing and sales organization to promote or co-promote certain of our product candidates.
