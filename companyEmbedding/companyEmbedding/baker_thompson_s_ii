Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

The Church According to Paul: Rediscovering the Community Conformed to Christ

Author: James W. Thompson
Publisher: Baker Academic
Publication Date: 2014
Pages: 303

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The Church according to Paul was the winner of the 2015 Book of the Year Award from the Academy of Parish Clergy.


Amid conflicting ideas about what the church should be and do in a post-Christian climate, the missing voice is that of Paul. The New Testament’s most prolific church planter, Paul faced diverse challenges as he worked to form congregations. Leading biblical scholar James Thompson examines Paul’s ministry of planting and nurturing churches in the pre-Christian world to offer guidance for the contemporary church. The church today, as then, must define itself and its mission among people who have been shaped by other experiences of community. Thompson shows that Paul offers an unprecedented vision of the community that is being conformed to the image of Christ. He also addresses contemporary (mis)understandings of words like missional, megachurch, and formation.


Always with one foot planted firmly in the academy and the other in the church, James Thompson has given us a highly insightful, theologically rich, and timely study of the apostle Paul’s view of the church—one of the best Pauline ecclesiologies in print. Thompson argues compellingly that Paul’s first-century vision of the church as a distinctive community speaks clearly to the twenty-first century. This excellent volume should be studied not only by students of Paul but also by all who are (rightly) concerned about the identity and mission of the church today.
—Michael J. Gorman, Raymond E. Brown Professor of Biblical and Theological Studies, St. Mary’s Seminary & University
James Thompson’s The Church according to Paul is as challenging as it is clever. It is clever because Thompson takes contemporary visions of the church and replaces the language of their proponents with Paul’s own language, thereby upturning today’s categories. It is challenging because it virtually dares those who are concerned with the state of the church today to rethink the church according to the mind of Paul. All in all, The Church according to Paul is a useful and quite valuable read for anyone interested in either the church or the Bible, perhaps even both.
—Raymond F. Collins, visiting scholar, Department of Religious Studies, Brown University
Diagnoses of the church’s problems and prescriptions for its flourishing abound. As James Thompson wisely observes, however, most contemporary discussion of the church shows little evidence of engagement with the letters of Paul. In this careful volume, Thompson studies the church in Paul’s words and his work, in the hope that Paul’s rich wisdom might have its rightful place in contemporary Christian reflection.
—Beverly Roberts Gaventa, distinguished professor of New Testament, Department of Religion, Baylor University


James W. Thompson is scholar in residence at the Graduate School of Theology at Abilene Christian University in Abilene, Texas. He is the editor of Restoration Quarterly and the author of numerous books, including Moral Formation according to Paul, Pastoral Ministry according to Paul, Preaching like Paul, and Hebrews in Paideia: Commentaries on the New Testament.




 

Galatians and Christian Theology: Justification, the Gospel, and Ethics in Paul’s Letter

Editors: Mark W. Elliott, Scott J. Hafemann, N. T. Wright, and John Frederick
Publisher: Baker Academic
Publication Date: 2014
Pages: 400

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The letter to the Galatians is a key source for Pauline theology as it presents Paul’s understanding of justification, the gospel, and many topics of keen contemporary interest. In this volume, some of the world’s top Christian scholars offer cutting-edge scholarship on how Galatians relates to theology and ethics.
The stellar list of contributors includes John Barclay, Beverly Gaventa, Richard Hays, Bruce McCormack, and Oliver O'Donovan. As they emphasize the contribution of Galatians to Christian theology and ethics, the contributors explore how exegesis and theology meet, critique, and inform each other.


Mark W. Elliott is reader in church history and head of the School of Divinity at the University of St. Andrews.
Scott J. Hafemann is reader in New Testament studies at the University of St. Andrews. He is the author of Paul, Moses, and the History of Israel; The God of Promise and the Life of Faith; Understanding the Heart of the Bible; and a commentary on 2 Corinthians. He is also the editor of Biblical Theology: Retrospect and Prospect.
N. T. Wright is research professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the University of St. Andrews. He is the author of over forty books, including Jesus and the Victory of God, The Resurrection of the Son of God, and a popular series of guides to the New Testament.
John Frederick, a PhD candidate at St. Andrews, is assistant professor and worship coordinator in the College of Theology at Grand Canyon University.




 

Ancient Israel’s History: An Introduction to Issues and Sources

Editors: Bill T. Arnold and Richard S. Hess
Publisher: Baker Academic
Publication Date: 2014
Pages: 560

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The history of Israel is a much-debated topic in Old Testament studies. On one side are minimalists who find little of historical value in the Hebrew Bible. On the other side are those who assume the biblical text is a precise historical record. Many serious students of the Bible find themselves between these two positions and would benefit from a careful exploration of issues in Israelite history.
This substantive history of Israel textbook values the Bible’s historical contribution without overlooking critical issues and challenges. Featuring the latest scholarship, the book introduces students to the current state of research on issues relevant to the study of ancient Israel. The editors and contributors, all top biblical scholars and historians, discuss historical evidence in a readable manner, using both canonical and chronological lenses to explore Israelite history.
Illustrative items, such as maps and images, visually support the book’s content. Tables and sidebars are also included.


Those who take the Bible seriously have been subjected to continual attack as skeptics make their accusations concerning the historical unreliability of the Old Testament. The search for scholarly responses has often been futile, but that is no longer the case. The information in this book, provided by an exemplary team of scholars, will arm readers with ways to answer skeptics. Equipped with these insightful investigations of the biblical text and the ancient world, readers can now offer an informed defense of the historical credibility of the Old Testament. This tool should become well worn as readers glean the vital information it provides.
—John H. Walton, professor of Old Testament, Wheaton College
A superb collection orienting readers to historical data and debates relevant to ancient Israel—judiciously weighed, accessibly presented.
—Mark J. Boda, professor of Old Testament, McMaster Divinity College; professor, Faculty of Theology, McMaster University
An excellent new resource for those interested in taking seriously all the evidence, both biblical and extrabiblical, bearing on the history of ancient Israel and in thinking carefully about how to weigh that evidence and integrate it into a coherent account.
—Iain Provan, Marshall Sheppard Professor of Biblical Studies, Regent College

Engaging the Christian Scriptures: An Introduction to the Bible

Authors: Andrew E. Arterbury, W.H. Bellinger, and Derek S. Dodson
Publisher: Baker Academic
Publication Date: 2014
Pages: 288

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This readable, affordable, and faith-friendly introduction to the Bible aids students as they engage in their first informed reading of the biblical text in an academic setting. The authors, who have significant undergraduate teaching experience, approach the Christian Scriptures from historical, literary, and theological perspectives. The book is designed for a one-semester course and is meant to be read alongside the biblical text, enabling students to become educated readers of the Bible. In the process, it introduces critical perspectives and approaches without undermining the theological claims found in the Christian Scriptures. The book includes text boxes, illustrations, maps, and suggestions for further reading.


This introduction to the Bible is brilliant in clarity and thoroughly engaging. Never before have I read a textbook that is as scholarly, concise, imaginatively written, and artistically laid out as this one. For teachers and students alike, this volume is a ‘pearl of great price’.
—Carol J. Dempsey, professor, University of Portland, Oregon
This team of scholars has put together an excellent text for a course covering both Old and New Testaments. Their summaries of the biblical books give a flavor for each book’s contents and the world that influenced the biblical writers. Of particular importance to students is the careful treatment of sometimes controversial materials as the authors demonstrate a moderate and thoughtful consideration of different viewpoints.
—Victor H. Matthews, professor, Missouri State University
An outstanding resource for guiding the beginning student to become an informed reader of Scripture. The authors present both the content of Scripture and the critical issues of interpretation in a way that is accessible and fair, providing students with the information necessary to form their own judgments. The book satisfies the need for an introductory textbook on the entire Bible that will engage student interest and provide resources for further study.
—James Thompson, professor, Graduate School of Theology, Abilene Christian University

In recent years, more and more Christians have come to appreciate the Bible’s teaching that the ultimate blessed hope for the believer is not an otherworldly heaven; instead, it is full-bodied participation in a new heaven and a new earth brought into fullness through the coming of God’s kingdom. Drawing on the full sweep of the biblical narrative, J. Richard Middleton unpacks key Old Testament and New Testament texts to make a case for the new earth as the appropriate Christian hope. He suggests its ethical and ecclesial implications, exploring the difference a holistic eschatology can make for living in a broken world.


Rooted in Scripture, chock-full of insight, clearly and fetchingly written, A New Heaven and a New Earth winsomely presents the biblical story of holistic salvation. Over against the all-too-common eschatology of heavenly rapture and earthly destruction, Richard Middleton’s new book reclaims the scriptural vision of cosmic renewal. In a time when the Bible is often used to justify ecological degradation, since (it is argued) the earth will in the eschaton be burned up to nothing, A New Heaven and a New Earth could not be more timely. Simply put, this sorely needed volume is the best book of its kind. May it find a great multitude of readers.
—Steven Bouma-Prediger, professor of religion, Hope College; author, For the Beauty of the Earth
This volume is a superb theological examination of a key biblical theme that is all too often neglected in academic circles. Ranging widely across Old Testament and New Testament texts, with careful attention to the history of Christian interpretation on this issue, Middleton presents a very thoughtful treatment that deserves wide attention.
—Terence E. Fretheim, emeritus Elva B. Lovell Professor of Old Testament, Luther Seminary
Richard Middleton is talking about a revolution! Why should Christians settle for the anemic goal of eternity spent in heaven when the Bible’s robust vision is one of a resurrected humanity on the new earth? Set your imagination free from the chains of other-worldly dualism, and enter into the brilliant and fascinating world of the biblical story, where the vision of all things redeemed breathes new life into our discipleship.
—Sylvia Keesmaat, adjunct professor of biblical studies, Trinity College, University of Toronto
