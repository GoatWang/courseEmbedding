Troy Industries is an American company that aims to help you upgrade your gun. If you have an AR15 and want to use iron sights but don't like the standard style, Troy has you covered.

Troy Swivels and Slings their bread and butter though, so when you need an easy to attach and super reliable sling there's no better choice than Troy. There are so many ways to upgrade a firearm but it's important to ensure the parts you use are as tough as possible. Troy Industries Products are designed with the battlefield in mind. Even in the worst conditions they will perform, leaving you free to worry about the situation and not your gear. Trust in Troy.
