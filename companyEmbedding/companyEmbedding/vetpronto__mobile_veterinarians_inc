Joe coordinated a vet taxi pickup and dropoff for Mowgli, that arrived both on time and with updates as to when they'd be there/dropping off. Very helpful. The cleaning it self seemingly went very well - his teeth are now very white, and he is resting very soundly. :) As Mowgli is now an 8 year old (kind of fat lab mix) i was a little worried about him going under anesthesia but Joe and the team at VP were very reassuring and did a fantastic job. We'll continue using VetPronto for all of our vet needs for both of our very loved dogs.ReadMoreLessJulian F.San FranciscoHuge convenience.

My cat is shy and still adjusting to our place, so it was great that after the initial shock of the vet entering (she is shy around every new person she meets), we could first talk a little bit while she was in her favorite hideout. The exam and vaccination went well, the vet was very gentle and soothing to my cat, and by the time the vet was leaving, she was already starting to relax!

As the body’s main communication network, the nervous system is capable of altering biochemical and physiologic properties of any intact body system.Acupuncture can:Increase circulationModulate the immune systemRelieve muscle spasm and painRelease endorphinsOptimize healthy nerve transmissionRegulate hormone levelsWhen can acupuncture be used?Arthritis and other joint problemsMuscle problemsNervous system and spinal problemsSkin problemsDigestive tract problemsImmune problemsUrinary tract problemsAllergiesAnd many other disruptions to the body’s functionSafety and pain concernsFor most animals, the insertion of small acupuncture needles is virtually painless. Once the needles are in place, there should be no pain at all. Actually, many animals become very relaxed or sleepy with their needles.Acupuncture is performed using sterile, single-use needles which minimizes the possibility of infection. And because acupuncture balances the body’s own system of healing and no chemicals are administered, complications rarely, if ever, develop.The Best Vet Care Happens at HomeWe carefully review your pet's previous recordsContinuity of care is very important.

You may wish to provide them with their favorite blanket or toy to make them feel even more relaxed during the exam.Your veterinarian will sometimes be accompanied by a veterinary technician to assist with handling or blood tests. We will take as long as you need at the appointment, performing a comprehensive physical exam, devising a treatment plan with you, and answering any questions. Appointments tend to be longer than in a clinic - averaging about 30 minutes per patient.After the appointment, you will receive a summary email outlining everything that was discussed at the appointment and any plans for next steps. Should you need to book a recheck appointment, you can request the same veterinarian as desired. Our staff are also available around the clock to answer any questions that may arise after the appointment.Our ServicesVaccinationsProceduresDiagnosticsMedicationsIntegrative MedicineEnd of Life CareSurgical ProceduresImagingOur Mobile VetsDr. Kirsten JensenSan FranciscoDr. Sarah SantiagoSan JoseDr. Megan CarolanChicagoDr. Rachel GoldfarbSan FranciscoSee MoreThe Best Vet Care Happens at HomeWe carefully review your pet's previous recordsContinuity of care is very important.

Getting to the vet isn't easy either without a car. Luckily for us we found VetPronto! I booked a 6pm appointment for the next day right after dinner. It was probably the easiest experience ever - I counted roughly about 3 clicks (book appointment, pick time, complete appointment)...maybe spent 2 minutes total. I got a phone call about 5 minutes later to confirm the appointment and to ask additional information about my pet and the reason for the visit. They went through the trouble of getting all my dog's historical medical records and connected w/ all the previous veterinarians she has seen. Later I found out I needed to change the appointment time (it was almost midnight at this time). I wanted to get it done the next day first thing in the morning....and I emailed the good folks at VetPronto thinking there was no chance for a response or booked appointment. Looks like I was wrong! 5 minutes later, the CEO personally emailed me and told me he could come see my dog at 9am tomorrow morning. Wow! Appointment went great - perfectly on time, quick, thorough, and I think it was the first time my dog didn't run away from the vet ever. VetPronto are consummate professionals and were exceptionally caring towards my dog. Pricing was very reasonable and nothing beats the convenience of the vet showing up at your own home. Thanks to VetPronto for a great experience! I'll definitely be using them again.ReadMoreLessJohnson H.San FranciscoThe vet and the folks at VetPronto are awesome.

This is my 2nd time using their vets and I'm as impressed as I was the first time around. Their vets are knowledgable and very patient with my cats (let's be honest, my cats aren't the easiest babies to handle). They took amazing care of Veer and Raja. Moreover, the luxury of having a full vet service visit your home means much time saved and so many less tears shed (my cats are very opposed to getting into their carriers).
I love VetPronto and couldn't imagine going back to any other way of treatment for the kitties!ReadMoreLessJackie R.San FranciscoThe other reviewers are spot on - this service is amazing. My tuxedo cat is terrified of people and has never been transported, but his coat is matting, and I want to be sure it's not a sign of something more serious. I was able to schedule an appointment immediately. Dr. O'Conner and her vet colleague arrived on time and were incredibly patient and persistent in getting little Miles situated (wrapped in a towel) so they could examine him and take blood work. The entire process from booking to end of appointment was seamless, and I didn't have to leave my house for any of it. Time (and money) saved is a no brainer. Thanks so much, Vet Pronto! My new favorite service in the Bay Area!ReadMoreLessVeronica B.San FranciscoDr. O'Connor really made us feel at ease during our house call for our dog. The dog's toenail had split, and I was really worried that she was in a lot of pain. Dr. O'Connor was patient (with me and the dog!), answered all my questions, and was quick and efficient with the treatment (of administering a topical anesthetic and clipping back the nail, which I was terrified of doing). She also checked my dog's overall health, and recommended better flea and tick protection than what we were already using. And since I never would have remembered all the stuff she mentioned, I was grateful for the very thorough email detailing everything we went over in the visit. I would definitely recommend Dr. O'Connor and VetPronto! Saved everyone a lot of stress of going into the vet's office and dealing with all that drama. Scheduling was a snap, and I was able to get an appointment the very next morning! They even had all my vet records by the time she came over. Impressive!ReadMoreLessVETPRONTOPricingServicesMeet the VetsPet Health VideosBlogLocationsAtlantaBaltimoreChicagoDallasDenverLocationsJacksonvilleLos AngelesNew OrleansNew YorkOrange CountyLocationsSan DiegoSan FranciscoSan JoseTampa BayWashington DCHaving an Emergency?If your pet is experiencing an emergency, please call San Francisco Veterinary Specialists at 415-401-9200.Terms of ServicePrivacy Policy

Terms and Conditions For All Promotional Vouchers Purchased Through Gilt City, Inc.
Terms & Conditions


The following terms and conditions apply to all promotional vouchers ("Vouchers") purchased through Gilt City, Inc. or its affiliated companies ("Gilt City"), except as otherwise specified on any particular Voucher and except as otherwise required by law.  In the event of a conflict between these terms and conditions and the actual Voucher, the Voucher itself will control.  All persons purchasing, printing, accepting, using or attempting to use any Voucher (each, a "Customer") agree to these terms and conditions.
All Vouchers are promotional in nature and are issued by the participating merchant or vendor ("Vendor") through Gilt City as a service provider. The Vendor is the holder and issuer of the Voucher and under no circumstances shall Gilt City be deemed the holder, issuer or seller of the Voucher. The law applicable to the Voucher shall be the law of the state where the Vendor interaction with the Customer occurs. As the holder and issuer of the Voucher, Vendor is solely responsible for the value and redemption of the Voucher and for any and all bodily injury, illness, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or relating to any Customer and the compliance with all laws, including, without limitation, unclaimed property and escheatment laws relating to the Vouchers. Each Customer hereby knowingly waives and releases Gilt City and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents and representatives, from any and all injuries, liabilities, damages, claims and rights of any nature whatsoever arising from any act or omission of the Vendor in connection with the Voucher, the provision of the services and products relating to the Voucher, and compliance by the Vendor with applicable law, including, without limitation, unclaimed property and escheatment laws. Gilt City's sole role is as a service provider for the Vendor, and the applicability and compliance with any relevant law relating to any Voucher is solely determined by and complied with by the Vendor.
The Vouchers are coupons that provide a discount price from the actual or retail cost from the Vendor.  That discount is available until the expiration date stated on the face of the Voucher.  After that time, the amount originally paid by the Customer to Gilt City (the "Purchase Value") will be valid for goods and services of the Vendor for a minimum of five years in all states.  If the Customer is located in a state which requires the Vendor to honor the Purchase Value of the Voucher beyond five years, the applicable law of Customer's state governs.  For example, a Voucher purchased for a particular service of the Vendor at the discounted price of $50 (actual retail price of $100) with an expiration date on the discount of six months from a specified date, may be used for the particular service for six months from such specified date; thereafter, the Customer may use the $50 value of the Voucher to purchase other goods and services of the Vendor for a minimum of five years, longer if required by applicable law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Vouchers that are redeemable for specific ticketed events, once the event date passes the Voucher expires.  Customer's acceptance of any redemption of a Voucher constitutes an acceptance of the redemption and a waiver of any claims associated with the Voucher.  The Voucher may not be redeemed for products or services other than those specified on the Voucher or as otherwise specifically permitted by this paragraph and may not be used to pay account balances or for products or services purchased from the Vendor prior to the purchase of the Voucher.
Vouchers are transferable without notice to Gilt City or Vendor. No resale of Vouchers is permitted unless such resale is permitted pursuant to applicable law. Vouchers are not redeemable for cash (in whole or in part) and have no cash value except as required by applicable law. If cash redemption is required by applicable law, the Customer will only be entitled to cash redemption based on the amount paid by the Customer to Gilt City for the Voucher, not the actual or retail cost from the Vendor. Vouchers may not be combined with any other offer, coupon, promotion or discount or certificate and must be used in a single visit to Vendor except as required by applicable law. Limit one Voucher per person per visit or purchase. Neither Gilt City nor Vendor is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers. If you lose your Voucher, go to the "My Account" section of the Gilt City site and print your certificate. The Vendor will accept the first Voucher presented with the unique number printed on the Voucher. Treat your Voucher as you would cash. Vouchers are subject to any limitations stated on the Voucher or by the Vendor. The issuance of any credits for the Vouchers are at the sole discretion of the Vendor except as required by applicable law. All restaurant Vouchers are valid for dine in only unless otherwise stated on the Voucher. Vouchers may not be used for alcohol, prior balances, shipping or handling, tips or gratuities or other fees except as expressly provided on the Voucher or as allowed by the Vendor and as permitted by applicable law. Unless otherwise stated on the Voucher or disclosed in connection with the purchase of the Voucher by Customer, the Voucher price does not include sales, value added or use taxes, which may be charged to you separately by the Vendor at the time you redeem the Voucher. Any attempted redemption of a Voucher in violation of these terms and conditions will render the Voucher void.
All purchases of Vouchers and other interactions with Gilt City are subject to our Privacy Policy.

Joe coordinated a vet taxi pickup and dropoff for Mowgli, that arrived both on time and with updates as to when they'd be there/dropping off. Very helpful. The cleaning it self seemingly went very well - his teeth are now very white, and he is resting very soundly. :) As Mowgli is now an 8 year old (kind of fat lab mix) i was a little worried about him going under anesthesia but Joe and the team at VP were very reassuring and did a fantastic job. We'll continue using VetPronto for all of our vet needs for both of our very loved dogs.ReadMoreLessJulian F.San FranciscoHuge convenience.
