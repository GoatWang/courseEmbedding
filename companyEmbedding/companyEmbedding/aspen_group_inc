Clean Air

                        Aspen Products Group has developed an air filter that simultaneously removes particulates and volatile organic compounds from gas streams using catalytically enhanced media. The self-cleaning filter can be integrated into exhaust or intake air systems to meet emissions requirements or provide high quality fresh air. Life cycle cost savings of 20 to 60% can be realized relative to the use of conventional filters, scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators, and activated carbon cartridges in applications such as diesel exhaust filtration, heating appliance exhaust cleanup, and kitchen exhaust cleanup.
                      For more information on exhaust clean-up products, please contact us.

Clean Energy

                        Aspen Products Group is a recognized leader in the production of systems that enable high efficiency fuel cells to operate directly on conventional fuels, bypassing the need for on-site hydrogen generation, storage, and dispensing. Although new infrastructure to deliver alternative fuels to the consumer is being built out, the use of fossil fuels for power generation and heating will remain prevalent for decades to come. Aspen's products are enabling the adoption of more efficient fossil-fueled power generation and heating systems, which is critical to protect the environment and reduce consumer costs now and in the future.
                      

                        Aspen Products Group has developed extensive expertise in the processing of energy-dense liquid fuels such as diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, and kerosene into hydrogen-rich synthesis gas to power fuel cell systems, stoves, and personal heaters. Our fuel reformers are custom-designed to meet customer product specifications to ensure successful integration of the hardware into the fuel cell or heating product at maximum efficiency and minimum cost.
                      Removal of sulfur from hydrocarbon fuels is a key step in the utilization of fossil fuels in fuel cells and other power generation systems, as sulfur is a strong fuel cell poison, contributes to environmental pollution, and, at high enough levels, can impact engine durability. Aspen Products Group is commercializing a highly efficient desulfurization technology capable of eliminating sulfur from a wide variety of fuel streams. Desulfurization systems capable of producing clean liquid fuels at rates of 0.1 to 10 GPH are being productized for stand-alone fuels production.
                      
                        Aspen Products Group is also developing a family of gas separation membranes that can be used to improve the efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of a variety of energy production processes. The membranes are designed to produce gas fluxes several times greater than conventional polymer membranes while maintaining high gas selectivity and improving membrane durability. Application of the membrane technology to hydrogen production, natural gas production, carbon dioxide sequestration, and air separation are being pursued.
                      For more information on fuel reforming, desulfurization, and gas separation products, please contact us.

Clean Water

                          Aspen Products Group is developing a low-cost water treatment method to produce pure water from non-potable water sources, such as sea water, brackish water, fracking water, and contaminated surface and ground waters. At the heart of Aspen's water treatment system is a unique water permeable membrane that exhibits high water flux, high contaminant rejection, and unsurpassed durability. Aspen Products Group's membrane technology helps customers reduce the cost to produce drinking water, reduce problems associated with wastewater disposal, and preserve fresh water supplies.
                        For more information on water purification products, please contact us.

                      Aspen Products Group has been integrating products from its technology base into solutions for its customers for over a decade. We begin the process with a collaborative concept development design step with the customer's input. Our materials and process technologies offer the flexibility of custom hardware design along with an ease of integration that yields predictable improvements to the performance and cost of our customers' products. A prototype development phase yields a hardware deliverable at or near full-scale product performance. Following performance validation, final component product hardware is developed and delivered. Aspen Products Group offers the facilities and expertise to initiate low rate production and then facilitate the transition to commercial manufacturing.

PAYROLLING
Another facet of the Aspen Group is our Payrolling Service. Companies who need to fill a vacancy for a temporary period of time, explore a temporary to permanent arrangement, manage a special project, accommodate seasonal fluctuations or unexpected growth or bring back employees after restructuring or retirement are excellent candidates for contractor payrolling.
If you have candidates who you would like to hire permanently or former employees that you would like to bring back short term, we can payroll them for you. Payrolling affords you the opportunity to work with individuals you might consider for permanent employment before you make a commitment and a large investment. Since you initially identified the candidate, saving us time and money, we can offer a cost savings. Additionally payrolling eliminates finder’s fees or buyouts if you do convert candidates to permanent employees.
Top 5 Reasons to Use Aspen Group’s Payrolling Services:

Focus on your business while we manage your payroll process.
Reduce your unemployment and workers’ comp claims by placing the responsibilities in our hands.
Determine if the perspective employee is the right individual before you make a final hiring decision.
Adjust the size of your workforce based on your staffing needs.
Reduce co employment risk.

Company Overview 
The Aspen Group, Inc. is a Workforce Management and Solutions Company headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland which provides facilities management/outsourcing, staff augmentation, project management, and consulting services. Initially founded in April, 1988, Aspen was the result of a careful analysis of the staffing industry and the identification of a range of unmet needs relative to quality of screening processes and commitment to customer service.  Utilizing a mission of service excellence and a goal of accommodating and cooperating with existing staffing firms, Aspen quickly took its place as a small, but strong industry leader.  Not long after, our intent to become a provider of temporary services morphed and developed into a more robust One-Stop Business Services Center that provides a wide range of employment arrangements and specialized career services throughout the US and abroad.
Aspen is certified by the following organizations:

NMSDC (National Minority Supplier Development Council)
Corporate Plus® Member of National Minority Supplier Development Council
WBENC (Women’s Business Enterprise National Council)
CPUC (California Public Utilities Corporation)
