Better Buy: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. vs. Williams Partners L.P.
If you like a steady income stream, only one of these partnerships is a good choice for you.











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Jun 28, 2017 at 11:26AM
            
            





Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) and Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE:WPZ) are both benefiting from increasing demand for midstream assets like natural gas pipelines. And investors can expect a nice income stream from each, with both offering unitholders distribution yields of around 6.3%. But there's a big difference between the two partnerships that income investors shouldn't ignore.
A bright future
At Williams Partners' recent analyst day, management spoke at length about the future. For example, at this point in time, the partnership's business is largely fee-based. That means demand for the company's midstream assets is more important than the price of what's being pushed through them.   

Image source: Getty Images.

And then there's the increasing demand for natural gas, which is a key focus for Williams. Between 2010 and 2016, the compound annual growth rate of gas demand was 3.2% a year. However, from 2016 to 2021, it's projected to be 3.8%. LNG exports, industrial demand, and utilities switching to natural gas are expected to be key drivers, with Williams' assets positioned to benefit.    
Williams is also expanding its footprint, with billions of dollars' worth of projects lined up to increase throughput. For example, the partnership has $7 billion worth of projects being worked on along the East Coast and Gulf Coast so it can better serve the Northeast's increasing appetite for natural gas.    

The big spend on the East Coast. Image source: Williams Partners L.P.

There's only one problem: Williams pretty much hit the reset button over the last year. In 2016 it sold assets to refocus its business and, in early 2017, it cut its distribution by 30%. There really is a lot to like about the future, and the distribution cut was likely the right thing to do for the partnership to help ensure it can achieve its goals. However, if income consistency is important to you, Williams isn't the right name for your portfolio until it proves it's on the right path to distribution sustainability.     
Steady as she goes
Which is why most investors would be better served by Enterprise Products Partners. This partnership is among the largest midstream players in the United States. It has assets ranging from pipelines to storage to processing to ships. Like Williams, its focus is on fee-based businesses.
And growth is important at Enterprise, too. At this point, it has around $8.4 billion worth of expansion projects in the works through 2019. Williams is a smaller partnership, with a market cap of around $37 billion compared to Enterprise's $57 billion. That means growth will be easier to achieve at Williams. But slow and steady isn't a bad thing if you're looking for consistent income.    

Enterprise is building, too. Image source: Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

Enterprise is, by the way, amazingly consistent. Despite oil falling from over $100 a barrel in mid-2014 to a nadir of $30 a barrel, Enterprise kept chugging along. For example, Its gross margin didn't drop like a rock; it trended sideways at a little over $5 billion. Plus, the distribution kept growing. In fact, there was never any question about the partnership's ability to support its distribution, which obviously can't be said of Williams.    
Enterprise has an incredible distribution record. For example, its streak of paying annual dividends is up to 20 years. That puts this 6.2% yielder in rare company, among names like IBM (22 years) and United Technologies (23 years). In just five more years it will qualify for the Dividend Aristocrats list. In contrast, Williams has to demonstrate its distribution commitment from the ground up.     
Twenty years, however, isn't the only streak Enterprise has going. It has also increased its distribution for 51 consecutive quarters. So not only are unitholders getting pay raises each year -- they're getting them each quarter! The rate of distribution growth is around 5%, handily beating the historical rate of inflation (around 3%) and providing a cornerstone investment for a diversified income portfolio. I'll take that over Williams' business and distribution reset any day.     





Investor takeaway
If you are willing to look past Williams' reset, there are solid reasons to like the partnership. But if you want a steady stream of income, it hasn't provided that and you can't just assume it will in the future. Enterprise, on the other hand, has rewarded unitholders with increasing distributions for 20 years. With nothing to suggest that trend is going to change, income-focused investors should drop Williams and pick up Enterprise.

Between The Numbers: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD), Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ)

By Homer Porter -   July 6, 2017

Shares of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) observed rebound of 12.45% since bottoming out at $24.01 on Nov. 02, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 2.04% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -0.15% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -10.74% from $30.25 , the 52-week high touched on Jan. 26, 2017, but are collecting gains at -6.9% for the past 12 months.
EPD Target Price Reaches $32.93
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD)’s shares projecting a $32.93 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD)’s Sales Declined?
 EPD’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -12.3% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 46.3% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
Williams Partners L.P. Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 10.47%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 17.46%, and the sector’s average is 58.21%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE:WPZ) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -5.1% since hitting a peak level of $42.32 on Jan. 30, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 2.95% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 5.6% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 21.96% higher from $32.93, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Nov. 09, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 4.64% for the past six months.
Analysts See Williams Partners L.P. 14.84% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ) to grow. At recent closing price of $40.16, WPZ has a chance to add $14.84 or 36.95% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($55) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.1 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE:WPZ) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, Williams Partners L.P.’s EPS growth has been nearly -16.3%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 8%, annually.
Is WPZ Turning Profits into Returns?
 Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ)’s ROE is 3.1%, while industry’s is 3.77%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 13.47%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 Williams Partners L.P.’s ROA is 2.33%, while industry’s average is 0.57%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 7.36. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

        Better Buy: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. vs. Williams Partners L.P.
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Reuben Gregg Brewer)

Jun 28, 2017





























































































Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD) and Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ) are both benefiting from increasing demand for midstream assets like natural gas pipelines. And investors can expect a nice income stream from each, with both offering unitholders distribution yields of around 6.3%. But there's a big difference between the two partnerships that income investors shouldn't ignore.A bright futureAt Williams Partners' recent analyst day, management spoke at length about the future. For example, at this point in time, the partnership's business is largely fee-based. That means demand for the company's midstream assets is more important than the price of what's being pushed through them.  
Image source: Getty Images.And then there's the increasing demand for natural gas, which is a key focus for Williams. Between 2010 and 2016, the compound annual growth rate of gas demand was 3.2% a year. However, from 2016 to 2021, it's projected to be 3.8%. LNG exports, industrial demand, and utilities switching to natural gas are expected to be key drivers, with Williams' assets positioned to benefit.    Williams is also expanding its footprint, with billions of dollars' worth of projects lined up to increase throughput. For example, the partnership has $7 billion worth of projects being worked on along the East Coast and Gulf Coast so it can better serve the Northeast's increasing appetite for natural gas.    The big spend on the East Coast. Image source: Williams Partners L.P.There's only one problem: Williams pretty much hit the reset button over the last year. In 2016 it sold assets to refocus its business and, in early 2017, it cut its distribution by 30%. There really is a lot to like about the future, and the distribution cut was likely the right thing to do for the partnership to help ensure it can achieve its goals. However, if income consistency is important to you, Williams isn't the right name for your portfolio until it proves it's on the right path to distribution sustainability.     Steady as she goesWhich is why most investors would be better served by Enterprise Products Partners. This partnership is among the largest midstream players in the United States. It has assets ranging from pipelines to storage to processing to ships. Like Williams, its focus is on fee-based businesses.And growth is important at Enterprise, too. At this point, it has around $8.4 billion worth of expansion projects in the works through 2019. Williams is a smaller partnership, with a market cap of around $37 billion compared to Enterprise's $57 billion. That means growth will be easier to achieve at Williams. But slow and steady isn't a bad thing if you're looking for consistent income.    Enterprise is building, too. Image source: Enterprise Products Partners L.P.
Enterprise is, by the way, amazingly consistent. Despite oil falling from over $100 a barrel in mid-2014 to a nadir of $30 a barrel, Enterprise kept chugging along. For example, Its gross margin didn't drop like a rock; it trended sideways at a little over $5 billion. Plus, the distribution kept growing. In fact, there was never any question about the partnership's ability to support its distribution, which obviously can't be said of Williams.    Enterprise has an incredible distribution record. For example, its streak of paying annual dividends is up to 20 years. That puts this 6.2% yielder in rare company, among names like IBM (22 years) and United Technologies (23 years). In just five more years it will qualify for the Dividend Aristocrats list. In contrast, Williams has to demonstrate its distribution commitment from the ground up.     Twenty years, however, isn't the only streak Enterprise has going. It has also increased its distribution for 51 consecutive quarters. So not only are unitholders getting pay raises each year -- they're getting them each quarter! The rate of distribution growth is around 5%, handily beating the historical rate of inflation (around 3%) and providing a cornerstone investment for a diversified income portfolio. I'll take that over Williams' business and distribution reset any day.    Investor takeaway
If you are willing to look past Williams' reset, there are solid reasons to like the partnership. But if you want a steady stream of income, it hasn't provided that and you can't just assume it will in the future. Enterprise, on the other hand, has rewarded unitholders with increasing distributions for 20 years. With nothing to suggest that trend is going to change, income-focused investors should drop Williams and pick up Enterprise.10 stocks we like better than Enterprise Products PartnersWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
