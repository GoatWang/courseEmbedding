STOUGHTON, Mass., July  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Randolph Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ:RNDB), the holding company for Randolph Savings Bank (the "Bank"), today announced net losses of $150,000, or $0.03 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and $597,000, or $0.11 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to net income of $718,000 and $720,000 for the same periods in the prior year. Operating results for all periods were affected by merger and integration costs related to the acquisition of First Eastern Bankshares Corporation ("First Eastern"), which was completed on July 1, 2016. Such costs amounted to $357,000 and $33,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $524,000 and $150,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, results for the second quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by a gain of $486,000 on a life insurance settlement. Exclusive of these non-recurring items and the related income tax effects, net income for the second quarter of 2017 would have been $67,000 compared to net income of $265,000 for the second quarter of 2016, and the net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2017 would have been $213,000 compared to net income of $384,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2017, total assets amounted to $507.9 million compared to $482.5 million at March 31, 2017, an increase of $25.4 million, or 5.3%. During this quarterly period, net loans held in portfolio increased by $12.0 million and loans held for sale increased by $12.1 million. During this same period, deposits increased by $6.5 million.
James P. McDonough, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with the growth in portfolio loans which have increased nearly 10% during the first half of 2017 as we continue to be focused on opportunities to leverage our capital and infrastructure. We are committed to investing in our people, facilities and technology to lay the foundation for future growth and profitability."
Mr. McDonough added, "We continue to make great progress in our merger integration initiatives and completed the conversion of loan origination systems during the second quarter. This conversion involved everyone in our mortgage banking operations and improves our capabilities in all phases of the residential loan origination process as we work to deliver as smooth and timely a mortgage experience as possible to our customers. The final phase of merger integration involves loan servicing with the conversion of systems expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2017. In addition, plans are underway to rebrand Randolph Savings Bank with a new name that better reflects our niche as a new model for community banking and a leader in residential lending."
Second Quarter Operating Results
Net interest income increased by $818,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was due to both the investment of IPO proceeds and the acquisition of First Eastern, which contributed to an increase in average interest-earning assets of $81.4 million between periods.  The Company's net interest margin increased in the second quarter of 2017 to 3.25% from 3.08% in the second quarter of 2016, due primarily to an increase in the ratio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities to 137.3% in the 2017 period compared to 118.0% in the 2016 period. This improvement was caused by both the deployment of $49.8 million in IPO proceeds and an increase of $23.2 million in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits between periods. The net interest margin for the second quarter of 2017 of 3.25% represented a 3 basis point increase from the first quarter of 2017 when the net interest margin was 3.22% due to rising asset yields following recent Federal Reserve Board increases in the federal funds rate.
The Company recognized a provision for loan losses of $100,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 while no provision was recorded in the prior year period. Classified and nonaccrual loan balances were stable during the quarter while regional and local economic data, including housing prices, continued their positive trend. The provision during the second quarter of 2017 primarily reflected portfolio growth in both real estate secured and non-real estate secured loans. The allowance for loan losses was at 0.97% of total loans at June 30, 2017 compared to 0.98% at December 31, 2016, and was 159.1% of non-performing loans at June 30, 2017 compared to 147.2% at December 31, 2016.
Non-interest income increased $1,348,000 from $2,086,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $3,434,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Exclusive of the gain of $486,000 on a life insurance settlement recognized in the 2016 period, the increase in non-interest income between periods would have been $1,834,000. This increase was primarily due to our mortgage banking business as gains on the sale of mortgage loans increased $1,462,000 to $2,520,000 and mortgage servicing fees increased $221,000 to $290,000 during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016. These increases are due to the acquisition of First Eastern on July 1, 2016. While loan sale gains in the second quarter of 2017 were $482,000, or 23.7%, higher than the first quarter of the year, they continue to be adversely affected by a lower volume of loan refinancing activity than experienced in 2016 and a shortage of homes currently being marketed for sale.
Non-interest expenses increased $3,188,000 from $4,240,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 to $7,428,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Included in both periods are merger and integration costs associated with the First Eastern acquisition, which amounted to $357,000 and $33,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Exclusive of these costs, the increase in non-interest expenses between periods would have been $2,864,000.  This increase is due in large part to the acquisition of First Eastern. While all expense categories experienced increases, the most significant increase was in salaries and employee benefits which increased $2,334,000, or 98.0%, during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016. The First Eastern acquisition resulted in a near doubling of the Company's number of employees.
A tax benefit of $254,000 was recognized for the three months ended June 30, 2017, while no benefit for income taxes was recognized for the three months ended June 30, 2016. State income taxes of $3,000 were provided during the three months ended June 30, 2016, with no state income tax provision in the 2017 period. The tax benefit resulted from, and was limited to, an offsetting tax provision attributable to other comprehensive income, specifically, appreciation in the fair value of available-for-sale securities. The Company has a net operating loss carryforward ("NOL") of $7.9 million. Since 2014, the NOL as well as other deferred tax assets have been subject to a full valuation allowance, which totaled $3.9 million at June 30, 2017.  We evaluate this position on a quarterly basis. In light of recent operating results and our expectations for the coming year, we concluded that the valuation allowance should be maintained at June 30, 2017.
Year-to-Date Operating Results
Net interest income increased by $1,552,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was due to both the investment of IPO proceeds and the acquisition of First Eastern, which contributed to an increase in average interest-earning assets of $79.0 million between periods.  The Company's net interest margin increased in the first half of 2017 to 3.24% from 3.10% in the first half of 2016, due primarily to an increase in the ratio of interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities to 137.7% in the 2017 period compared to 117.8% in the 2016 period. This improvement was caused by both the deployment of $49.8 million in IPO proceeds and an increase of $23.4 million in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits between periods.
The Company recognized a provision for loan losses of $335,000 and $62,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Classified and nonaccrual loan balances were stable during the first half of 2017 while regional and local economic data, including housing prices, continued their positive trend. The provision during the six months ended June 30, 2017 primarily reflected portfolio growth in both real estate secured and non-real estate secured loans.
Non-interest income increased $3,456,000 from $3,388,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $6,844,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Exclusive of the gain of $486,000 on a life insurance settlement recognized in the 2016 period, the increase in non-interest income between periods would have been $3,942,000. This increase was primarily due to our mortgage banking business as gains on the sale of mortgage loans increased $2,819,000 to $4,558,000 and mortgage servicing fees increased $781,000 to $950,000 during the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. The increase in mortgage servicing fees was positively affected by a $231,000 partial reversal of the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights due to an increase in their fair value attributable to slower loan prepayment speeds. The increases in mortgage banking income are due to the acquisition of First Eastern.
Non-interest expenses increased $6,302,000 from $8,255,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $14,557,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Included in both periods are merger and integration costs associated with the First Eastern acquisition, which amounted to $524,000 and $150,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Exclusive of these costs, the increase in non-interest expenses between periods would have been $5,928,000.  This increase is due in large part to the acquisition of First Eastern. While all expense categories experienced increases, the most significant increase was in salaries and employee benefits which increased $4,808,000, or 104.9%, during the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016. The First Eastern acquisition resulted in a near doubling of the Company's number of employees.
A tax benefit of $280,000 was recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2017 while no benefit for income taxes was recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2016. State income taxes of $3,000 were provided during each of the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The tax benefit resulted from, and was limited to, an offsetting tax provision attributable to other comprehensive income, specifically, appreciation in the fair value of available-for-sale securities.
Balance Sheet
Total assets were $507.9 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $481.2 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $26.7 million, or 5.6%. This growth was attributable to an increase in the loan portfolio partially offset by a reduction in cash equivalents.
Net loans totaled $365.0 million at June 30, 2017, an increase of $32.0 million from December 31, 2016. This increase occurred in both real estate secured ($12.4 million) and non-real estate secured ($19.7 million) loans. The increase in non-real estate secured loans was primarily due to $15.4 million in loan participations originated through a regional bank and the purchase of $5.0 million in refinanced student loans from an on-line lender specializing in the origination and refinancing of such loans. The loan participations are to local franchisees of a major international fast food retailer. The growth in real estate secured loans of $12.4 million was spread among residential, home equity, commercial and construction loans.
Deposits increased $17.4 million, or 5.0%, to $368.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $351.2 million at December 31, 2016. This increase was nearly entirely in core deposit accounts, including $10.2 million in noninterest-bearing accounts.  FHLB advances increased $9.8 million during the first half of 2017 to help fund loan growth. This increase consists entirely of overnight advances.
Total stockholders' equity was $83.3 million at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 as the net loss for the first half of 2017 of $597,000 was fully offset by appreciation in the fair value of available-for-sale securities and equity adjustments offsetting the expense of the employee stock ownership plan. The Company's tier one capital to average assets was 16.7% at June 30, 2017 compared to 16.9% at December 31, 2016. The Company and the Bank exceeded all of their regulatory capital requirements at June 30, 2017.

      Randolph Bancorp, Inc. Announces Commencement of Stock Offering
    





May 24, 2016 07:56 PM Eastern Daylight Time



STOUGHTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Randolph Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), the proposed holding company for 
      Randolph Savings Bank, Randolph, Massachusetts (the “Bank”), announced 
      that the registration statement relating to the sale of common stock of 
      the Company has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission.
    

      The Company is offering for sale between 3,655,000 and 4,945,000 
      (subject to a 15% increase to up to 5,686,750) shares at a purchase 
      price of $10.00 per share in connection with the proposed conversion of 
      Randolph Bancorp, a Massachusetts mutual holding company and current 
      parent company of the Bank, to stock form. The Company is offering the 
      shares of its common stock in a subscription offering, with the first 
      priority to depositors of the Bank with a qualifying deposit account as 
      of December 31, 2014, second to depositors of the Bank with a qualifying 
      deposit account as of June 30, 2015, third to the Bank’s employee stock 
      ownership plan, and fourth to employees, officers, directors, trustees 
      and corporators of the Bank who do not have a higher priority to 
      purchase stock.
    

      The Company also intends to establish a charitable foundation as part of 
      the conversion and fund the charitable foundation with 4% of the gross 
      proceeds of the offering in cash and stock.
    

      Shares of common stock not purchased in the subscription offering may be 
      offered for sale to the general public in a community offering, with a 
      preference given to natural persons, and trusts of natural persons, 
      residing in the Massachusetts municipalities of Abington, Attleboro, 
      Avon, Braintree, Brockton, Canton, Easton, Foxboro, Holbrook, Mansfield, 
      Milton, North Attleboro, Norton, Plainville, Quincy, Randolph, Sharon, 
      Stoughton and Weymouth and the Rhode Island municipalities of Central 
      Falls, Cranston, Cumberland, East Greenwich, East Providence, Jamestown, 
      Johnston, Lincoln, Middletown, Newport, North Kingstown, North 
      Providence, North Smithfield, Pawtucket, Portsmouth, Providence, 
      Smithfield, Warwick, West Warwick and Woonsocket, and thereafter to 
      cover orders of other members of the general public. The Company also 
      may offer for sale shares of common stock not purchased in the 
      subscription offering or the community offering to the general public 
      through a syndicated community offering or a firm commitment 
      underwritten offering, which will be managed by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, 
      a Stifel Company.
    

      The subscription offering is scheduled to conclude on June 15, 2016 at 
      2:00 p.m. Eastern time.
    

      The Company has established a Stock Information Center, which opened on 
      Monday, May 23, 2016. Interested investors should contact the Stock 
      Information Center at 1-877-821-5783. Hours of operation are from 10:00 
      a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday, except Bank 
      Holidays.
    

      The Bank’s corporators have voted to approve the plan of conversion and 
      the establishment and funding of the new charitable foundation.
    

      The conversion and offering will not have any impact on depositors, 
      borrowers or other customers of the Bank or their accounts or loans, as 
      there are no changes to the Bank’s products, services, rates or fees 
      contemplated in the plan of conversion.
    

      The Company must sell at least 3,655,000 shares of its common stock in 
      the offering. Completion of the conversion and offering is also subject 
      to final bank regulatory approvals and other customary closing 
      conditions.
    

A registration statement relating to the common stock has been filed 
      with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. This 
      press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer 
      to buy common stock. The offer will be made only by means of the 
      written prospectus forming part of the registration statement (and, in 
      the case of the subscription and community offerings, an accompanying 
      stock order form). The shares of common stock of the Company are 
      not savings accounts or savings deposits and are not insured by the 
      Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Depositors Insurance Fund, or 
      any other government agency.


Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains certain forward-looking statements about the 
      conversion and the offering. Forward-looking statements include 
      statements regarding anticipated future events and can be identified by 
      the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current 
      facts. They often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” 
      “anticipate,” “estimate,” and “intend” or future or conditional verbs 
      such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may”. Forward-looking 
      statements, by their nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties. 
      Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
      from expected results include delays in consummation of the plan of 
      conversion, difficulties in selling the common stock or in selling the 
      common stock within the expected time frame, increased competitive 
      pressures, changes in the interest rate environment, general economic 
      conditions or conditions within the securities markets, and legislative 
      and regulatory changes that could adversely affect the business in which 
      the Company and Bank are engaged.
