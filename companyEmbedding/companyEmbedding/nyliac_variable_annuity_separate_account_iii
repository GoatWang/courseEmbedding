Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

                                            Your Retirement Big Picture: Where Do Annuities Fit?

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

2.
Delete and replace the section titled, New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation and the Separate Account  Money Market Fund Fees and Gates with the following: 
Money Market Fund Fees and Gates 
The SEC has adopted rules that provide that all money market funds can impose liquidity fees and/or suspend redemptions under certain
circumstances. The liquidity fees can be up to 2% of the amount redeemed, and the suspensions of redemptions (redemption gates) can last for ten (10) business days. Money market funds can impose these fees and gates (which could be
applied to all Policy transfers, surrenders, withdrawals and benefit payments from that portfolio) based on the liquidity of the funds assets and other factors. All types of money market funds have the ability to impose these fees and gates,
but government money market funds (that invest at least 99.5% of their assets in cash, U.S. government securities and/or repurchase agreements that are secured by cash or government securities) are less likely to impose such fees and gates.

NYLIAC Variable Annuity Separate Account-IV
 This supplement amends the prospectuses (each a Prospectus, and together, the Prospectuses) for the
New York Life variable annuity policies listed above that are issued by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC). This supplement describes changes to the investment options available under such policies. You should read
this information carefully and retain this supplement for future reference together with the Prospectus for your policy. This supplement is not valid unless it is read in conjunction with the Prospectus for your policy. All capitalized terms used
but not defined herein have the same meaning as those included in the Prospectuses.  NYLIAC has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC) for an order permitting each of NYLIACs above referenced separate accounts to substitute shares of the Existing Portfolio with shares of the Replacement Portfolio below. NYLIAC anticipates that, if such order
is granted, the SEC will issue the order approving the foregoing substitution early August 2016. The effective date established for the substitution is expected to be on or about August 26, 2016 (the Effective Date). All expenses
incurred in connection with the substitution will be paid by either NYLIAC or an affiliate. You will not incur any fees, charges or any tax liability because of the substitution. 
 






Proposed Substitution

Existing Portfolio
 
Replacement Portfolio


Royce Micro-Cap Portfolio  Investment Class
 
MainStay VP Small Cap Core Portfolio  Service Class
 Prior to the Effective Date. For thirty (30) days before the Effective Date, if you have allocations in the
Existing Portfolio, you may transfer such allocations to any other available investment option without any charge or limitation (except potentially harmful transfers (see the Limits on Transfers section in the Prospectus for your
policy)) and without the transfer counting toward the number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given Policy Year. Such transfer will be based on the Accumulation Unit value of the Investment Division for the Existing Portfolio as of
the close of the Business Day that we receive the transfer request. All other transfers are subject to limitations, and may be subject to charges, as described in the Prospectus for your policy. Please see the Prospectus for your policy for
information on how to complete transfers from the Investment Division for the Existing Portfolio to other investment options that we currently offer. 


Until the Effective Date, we will continue to process automatic transactions (such as dollar cost averaging,
automatic asset rebalancing and interest sweep), involving the Existing Portfolio, unless you provide us with alternate allocation instructions. Also note that the Existing Portfolio will not accept new premium payment allocations or transfers as of
the Effective Date. We have included the prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio along with this supplement.  On the Effective Date. Any of your
allocations that remain in the Existing Portfolio will be redeemed. Those redemptions will then be used to purchase Accumulation Units in the Investment Division for the Replacement Portfolio. All policyowners affected by the substitution will
receive a written confirmation of the transaction. The redemption and subsequent repurchase transactions required to effectuate the substitution will not be treated as transfers that count toward the number of free transfers that may otherwise be
made in a given Policy Year.  Your Accumulation Value immediately prior to the Effective Date will be equal to your Accumulation Value immediately after
the Effective Date; however, the number of units you receive in the Investment Division for the Replacement Portfolio may be different from the number of units in the Investment Division for the Existing Portfolio. There will also be no change to
your policys death benefit as a result of the substitution.  After the Effective Date. Immediately following the Effective Date, the Existing
Portfolio will no longer be available as an investment option under the policies. In addition, for the thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, you may transfer all or a portion of your Accumulation Value out of the Investment Division
for the Replacement Portfolio to another investment option without any charge or limitation (except potentially harmful transfers (see the Limits on Transfers section in the Prospectus for your Policy)) and without the transfer counting
toward the number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given Policy Year. Such transfer will be based on the Accumulation Unit value of the Investment Division for the Replacement Portfolio as of the close of the Business Day that we
receive the transfer request. All other transfers are subject to limitations, and may be subject to charges, as described in the Prospectus for your policy. Please see the Prospectus for your policy for information on how to complete transfers from
the Replacement Portfolio to other investment options that we currently offer.  We will also continue to process automatic transactions (such as dollar
cost averaging, automatic asset rebalancing and interest sweep) after the Effective Date, except that allocations previously processed to or from the Existing Portfolio will be processed to or from the Replacement Portfolio. 
A complete list of the investment options that are available under your policy, other than the Replacement Portfolio, is set forth in the Prospectus for your
policy. You may obtain a copy of the Prospectus for your policy by calling 1 (800) 598-2019. Information regarding the Replacement Portfolio, including the investment objectives, policies, risks and fees and expenses, is contained in the
Replacement Portfolios prospectus included with this supplement.

Accumulation Unit Values for New York Life Variable Annuity and New York Life Flexible Premium Variable Annuity Investing in NYLIAC Variable Annuity Separate Account III for Policies Purchased Prior to June 2, 2003*
This daily updated chart is your resource for tracking the accumulation unit values of the Investment Divisions of the New York Life Variable Annuity and New York Life Flexible Premium Variable Annuity. For more current to the most recent month-end performance information including average annual total return, please click on the New York Life Flexible Premium Variable Annuity Performance Summary or the New York Life Variable Annuity Performance Summary.
Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Due to current market volatility, current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown. The investment return and the Accumulation Value of your policy will fluctuate so that a policy, when surrendered, may be worth more or less than the premium payments. All performance reflects the percentage change for the period shown with capital gains and dividends reinvested and includes an annualized Separate Account Expense Charge of 1.40%. A policy service charge equal to the lesser of $30 or 2% of the Accumulation Value of the policy for the New York Life Variable Annuity and $30 for the New York Life Flexible Premium Variable Annuity, is not included in these charges, but will be deducted each year on the policy anniversary and upon surrender if on that date the accumulation value is less than $20,000. The Investment Divisions offered under the New York Life Variable Annuity and New York Life Flexible Premium Variable Annuity described herein are different from mutual funds that may have similar names but are available directly to the general public. Investment results may differ.
New allocations to the MainStay VP Eagle Small Cap Growth – Initial Class or MainStay VP Janus Balanced – Initial Class Investment Divisions will not be accepted from Policyowners who were not invested in the MainStay VP Eagle Small Cap Growth – Initial Class or MainStay VP Janus Balanced – Initial Class Investment Division on February 17, 2012. For existing Policyowners, if you remove all of your Accumulation Value from the MainStay VP Eagle Small Cap Growth – Initial Class or MainStay VP Janus Balanced – Initial Class Investment Divisions on or after February 17, 2012, you will not be able to reinvest in these Investment Divisions.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
