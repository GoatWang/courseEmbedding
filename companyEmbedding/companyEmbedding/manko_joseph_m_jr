ProfileProfessional HighlightsPressroomPublicationsJoe is a founding partner of Manko, Gold, Katcher & Fox, LLP with more than 40 years of experience advising clients on environmental matters involving real estate transactions and development, regulatory permitting and compliance, environmental reporting and alternative dispute resolution. Joe’s experience as the EPA Region III’s general counsel, after almost 10 years as a corporate practitioner, gave him the ability to see and therefore provide counsel on environmental issues in real life situations. He spent 18 years teaching environmental law courses at the University of Pennsylvania and Vermont Law Schools.  Prior to founding the firm in 1989, Joe founded and chaired the Environmental Department at Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen.  Manko served for 27 years as an elected commissioner and officer on the Lower Merion Board of Commissioners, giving him insight into municipal issues. He is the past chair of the Pennsylvania Environmental Council, former vice chair of the State Water Law Committee of the Pennsylvania Bar Association, and past chair of the Environmental Law Committee of the Philadelphia Bar Association.  Appointed by Governor Tom Ridge in July 1997, Joe served on Pennsylvania's 21st Century Environment Commission and served as Governor Rendell’s designee to chair the Board of Directors of the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST) from 2003-2012. He co-chaired Mayor Nutter’s Sustainability Advisory Board from 2008-2015.  Away from work, Joe serves on the boards of the Fairmount Park Conservancy, Philadelphia Film Society and Philadelphia Orchestra. He formerly served on the Fairmount Park Commission board.   Joe has been married to his childhood sweetheart Lynn for more than 50 years; they have 3 children and 6 grandchildren.  His avocations are golf, tennis and traveling.
Representative experience includes the following:  negotiating and drafting the environmental provisions included in transactional documents involving the sale, purchase, leasing, and financing of real estate; counseling with respect to the development and redevelopment of brownfield properties, including attainment of governmental cleanup liability protection under Pennsylvania and New Jersey brownfield programs and the federal Superfund program; negotiating documents to effect the settlement of violations of permits or government laws alleged by the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Departments of Environmental Protection ("DEPs") and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"); obtaining regulatory approvals for real estate developments from the Pennsylvania and New Jersey DEPs, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other federal and state regulatory agencies and municipalities; representing clients before the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board and state and federal administrative agencies and courts; serving as a mediator or arbitrator in numerous environmental cases, including the allocation of costs to be incurred by responsible parties in several Superfund disputes involving tens of millions of dollars; and advising clients and formulating policy on emerging issues related to the emission of greenhouse gases and other aspects of climate change.
