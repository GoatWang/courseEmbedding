Notebook Computers




Does your company have a mobile workforce? Notebook computers are an essential tool for employees who are on the go. Notebooks are compact, lightweight, and portable. Equipped with a computer notebook, an employee in the field or on-site with clients can remain connected to the office and conduct... normal business activities. There are several types of notebooks available—from more robust, powerful desktop replacements to stripped-down, ultra-portable notebooks used primarily for Web browsing and light computing applications. The emergence of Ultrabooks has even provided a computing solution for mobile, power users. Ultrabooks combine powerful processing with a lightweight, ultra-portable body. Connection can help your business find the notebooks to meet your computing and mobility requirements while staying within budget.
We have an extensive inventory of computer notebook options from the top brands, including Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, and Toshiba. Lenovo has a great line of notebook computers designed and engineered specifically for the business professional. The Lenovo ThinkPad T Series is stylishly thin and delivers excellent performance. Its advanced battery technology lets your employees work whenever and wherever they want.
In addition to the computer notebook options we have available, Connection also offers companion products and advanced technology services to improve your company’s mobile computing efforts. Our wide selection of notebook accessories includes carrying cases, docking stations, and batteries. We also have a trained staff of experienced technical experts to help provide your company with a better understanding of its network landscape. Our Mobility Services will help you successfully plan, design, and deploy your next mobile IT initiative. Learn how we can assist you with the security concerns inherent in a BYOD business environment.

Style Scores:



A Value | B Growth | B Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]
PC Connection, Inc. was founded in 1982 by Patricia Gallup and David Hall. The co-founders met while serving as a support crew to hikers on the Appalachian Trail.[5]
The company’s first headquarters occupied a former woodworking mill in Marlow, NH.[5] To launch their business, Gallup and Hall used Gallup’s savings of $8,000 to purchase inventory and take out a 1/9th-page ad in Byte magazine.[6]
In 1987, PC Connection was named to the Inc. 500 as the second fastest growing company in the United States.[7]
In March 1998, the company completed its Initial Public Offering on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol PCCC.[8]
In September 2016, the company announced a corporate rebranding. The "Connection" brand unites all subsidiaries (PC Connection, GovConnection, MoreDirect, and Softmart) under one brand name. NASDAQ stock ticker changes from PCCC to CNXN.[9]

The company’s first headquarters occupied a former woodworking mill in Marlow, NH.[5] To launch their business, Gallup and Hall used Gallup’s savings of $8,000 to purchase inventory and take out a 1/9th-page ad in Byte magazine.[6]
In 1987, PC Connection was named to the Inc. 500 as the second fastest growing company in the United States.[7]

In January 2000, Connection announced the agreement to acquire Merisel Inc. in alliance with its initiative to add infrastructure.[13]

PC Connection, Inc. was founded in 1982 by Patricia Gallup and David Hall. The co-founders met while serving as a support crew to hikers on the Appalachian Trail.[5]
The company’s first headquarters occupied a former woodworking mill in Marlow, NH.[5] To launch their business, Gallup and Hall used Gallup’s savings of $8,000 to purchase inventory and take out a 1/9th-page ad in Byte magazine.[6]
In 1987, PC Connection was named to the Inc. 500 as the second fastest growing company in the United States.[7]
In March 1998, the company completed its Initial Public Offering on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol PCCC.[8]
In September 2016, the company announced a corporate rebranding. The "Connection" brand unites all subsidiaries (PC Connection, GovConnection, MoreDirect, and Softmart) under one brand name. NASDAQ stock ticker changes from PCCC to CNXN.[9]

Acquisitions[edit]
In 1999, Connection purchased ComTeq Federal, a Maryland-based company serving the computing needs of federal government agencies, including the Navy, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, the National Security Agency, and Internal Revenue Service.[12] Renamed GovConnection, Inc., the subsidiary serves all government and education customers.
In January 2000, Connection announced the agreement to acquire Merisel Inc. in alliance with its initiative to add infrastructure.[13]
In 2002, Connection acquired MoreDirect, a Florida-based IT solutions provider specializing in Web-based eProcurement.[14]
In 2005, Connection purchased the business and selected assets of Amherst Technologies, Inc., a New Hampshire-based IT provider.[15]
In 2011, Connection acquired ValCom Technologies, a technology services company in the Chicago metropolitan area.[16]

History[edit]
PC Connection, Inc. was founded in 1982 by Patricia Gallup and David Hall. The co-founders met while serving as a support crew to hikers on the Appalachian Trail.[5]
The company’s first headquarters occupied a former woodworking mill in Marlow, NH.[5] To launch their business, Gallup and Hall used Gallup’s savings of $8,000 to purchase inventory and take out a 1/9th-page ad in Byte magazine.[6]
In 1987, PC Connection was named to the Inc. 500 as the second fastest growing company in the United States.[7]
In March 1998, the company completed its Initial Public Offering on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol PCCC.[8]
In September 2016, the company announced a corporate rebranding. The "Connection" brand unites all subsidiaries (PC Connection, GovConnection, MoreDirect, and Softmart) under one brand name. NASDAQ stock ticker changes from PCCC to CNXN.[9]

In addition to its corporate headquarters in Merrimack, NH, PC Connection, Inc. has sales and support offices in Keene and Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Marlborough, Massachusetts; Rockville, Maryland; Dakota Dunes, South Dakota; Boca Raton, Florida; Shelton, CT; Downingtown, PA, and Schaumburg, IL.[10] The company operates a 268,000-square-foot distribution and fulfillment complex, equipped with an ISO 9001 certified technical configuration lab, in Wilmington, Ohio.[11]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1999, Connection purchased ComTeq Federal, a Maryland-based company serving the computing needs of federal government agencies, including the Navy, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, the National Security Agency, and Internal Revenue Service.[12] Renamed GovConnection, Inc., the subsidiary serves all government and education customers.
In January 2000, Connection announced the agreement to acquire Merisel Inc. in alliance with its initiative to add infrastructure.[13]
In 2002, Connection acquired MoreDirect, a Florida-based IT solutions provider specializing in Web-based eProcurement.[14]
In 2005, Connection purchased the business and selected assets of Amherst Technologies, Inc., a New Hampshire-based IT provider.[15]
In 2011, Connection acquired ValCom Technologies, a technology services company in the Chicago metropolitan area.[16]
In 2016, Connection acquired Softmart, a Microsoft Licensing Solution Provider (LSP) and global supplier of technology, tools, and service solutions.[17]
In 2016, Connection acquired GlobalServe.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
