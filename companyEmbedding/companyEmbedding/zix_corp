    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Zix Corporation (ZixCorp) (NASDAQ: ZIXI) is a security technology company that provides email encryption services, email data loss prevention (DLP) and mobile applications designed to address bring your own device (BYOD) corporate technology trend.[3] Headquartered in Dallas, Texas,[2] the company serves customers that include divisions of the U.S. Treasury, federal financial regulators, health insurance providers and hospitals,[4] and financial companies.[5] As of December 2011, the company has served over thirty Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations, 1,200 hospitals, 1,600 banks, credit unions and associations. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) regulators are also the customers of the company.[6] CIPROMS has signed a three-year renewal for the company in 2014.[7]
The company generates money based on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) strategy and charge annual fees from its customers.[6] ZixCorp was founded in 1983. The company operates its service supported by ZixData Center, a data center storing transaction processing data. In 2002, the company changed its name from Zixlt Corporation to Zix Corporation.[8]
In 2017, Zix acquired Greenview Data for $6.5 million.[9]
Products and Services[edit]
The recent court battle between Apple and the FBI, along with a slew of major security breaches from Experian to Ashley Madison, have popularized encryption as a way to protect messages, yet email encryption is also reported to be difficult to use for people unfamiliar with the encryption process.[10] To simplify the encryption process, Zix email encryption uses an e-mail encryption directory called ZixDirectory that lists other email addresses protected by the encryption service to maintain a community of users who can send and receive e-mails to each other without having to use encryption keys.[11]
Customers install a ZixGateway appliance and configure compliance and security policy requirements, then the appliance monitors outbound emails to determine whether messages should be encrypted, and then works in conjunction with secure servers in a SaaS (software-as-a-service) environment to encrypt outgoing communications and securely decrypt inbound messages from other users listed within the ZixDirectory.[11] The email encryption service, ZixDirectory, is an international community with 30 million members.[6]
In 2014, Google announced a partnership with ZixCorp to introduce a new commercial product for Google Apps accounts dubbed Google Apps Message Encryption (GAME), based on Zix Email Encryption. For a per-user subscription, the service allows Google Apps admins to configure encryption settings and routes from the Google Apps dashboard.[12][13]
Several market and policies have emerged to address BYOD security concerns, including mobile device management (MDM), containerization and app virtualization.[14][15][16]
In 2013, ZixCorp introduced ZixOne, a mobile email application for businesses coping with the BYOD trend of employees using personal devices for work, by protecting corporate data in email, while allowing employees to maintain privacy and control of their personal devices. The service provides access to corporate email in the cloud-based service, allowing employees to view messages and attachments without storing any data on the device.[17] This approach differs mobile device management (MDM),[18] which provides organizations with the ability to control applications and content on the device. Research has revealed controversy around MDM related to employee privacy and usability issues that lead to resistance in some organizations.[19] Corporate liability issues have also emerged when businesses use MDM to wipe devices after employees leave the organization.[20]
To help organizations that must comply with industry and federal regulations restricting content that can be sent via email, the company introduced ZixDLP to quarantine emails violating policies, and ZixDLP Insight to detect and analyze email policy violations without impeding communications or business workflows. The data protection service is offered as an add-on solution for customers who use ZixGateway, a policy-based email encryption service that automatically scans and encrypts outbound email containing sensitive information.[21]

Zix Corporation (ZixCorp) (NASDAQ: ZIXI) is a security technology company that provides email encryption services, email data loss prevention (DLP) and mobile applications designed to address bring your own device (BYOD) corporate technology trend.[3] Headquartered in Dallas, Texas,[2] the company serves customers that include divisions of the U.S. Treasury, federal financial regulators, health insurance providers and hospitals,[4] and financial companies.[5] As of December 2011, the company has served over thirty Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations, 1,200 hospitals, 1,600 banks, credit unions and associations. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) regulators are also the customers of the company.[6] CIPROMS has signed a three-year renewal for the company in 2014.[7]
The company generates money based on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) strategy and charge annual fees from its customers.[6] ZixCorp was founded in 1983. The company operates its service supported by ZixData Center, a data center storing transaction processing data. In 2002, the company changed its name from Zixlt Corporation to Zix Corporation.[8]
In 2017, Zix acquired Greenview Data for $6.5 million.[9]
Products and Services[edit]
The recent court battle between Apple and the FBI, along with a slew of major security breaches from Experian to Ashley Madison, have popularized encryption as a way to protect messages, yet email encryption is also reported to be difficult to use for people unfamiliar with the encryption process.[10] To simplify the encryption process, Zix email encryption uses an e-mail encryption directory called ZixDirectory that lists other email addresses protected by the encryption service to maintain a community of users who can send and receive e-mails to each other without having to use encryption keys.[11]
Customers install a ZixGateway appliance and configure compliance and security policy requirements, then the appliance monitors outbound emails to determine whether messages should be encrypted, and then works in conjunction with secure servers in a SaaS (software-as-a-service) environment to encrypt outgoing communications and securely decrypt inbound messages from other users listed within the ZixDirectory.[11] The email encryption service, ZixDirectory, is an international community with 30 million members.[6]
In 2014, Google announced a partnership with ZixCorp to introduce a new commercial product for Google Apps accounts dubbed Google Apps Message Encryption (GAME), based on Zix Email Encryption. For a per-user subscription, the service allows Google Apps admins to configure encryption settings and routes from the Google Apps dashboard.[12][13]
Several market and policies have emerged to address BYOD security concerns, including mobile device management (MDM), containerization and app virtualization.[14][15][16]
In 2013, ZixCorp introduced ZixOne, a mobile email application for businesses coping with the BYOD trend of employees using personal devices for work, by protecting corporate data in email, while allowing employees to maintain privacy and control of their personal devices. The service provides access to corporate email in the cloud-based service, allowing employees to view messages and attachments without storing any data on the device.[17] This approach differs mobile device management (MDM),[18] which provides organizations with the ability to control applications and content on the device. Research has revealed controversy around MDM related to employee privacy and usability issues that lead to resistance in some organizations.[19] Corporate liability issues have also emerged when businesses use MDM to wipe devices after employees leave the organization.[20]
To help organizations that must comply with industry and federal regulations restricting content that can be sent via email, the company introduced ZixDLP to quarantine emails violating policies, and ZixDLP Insight to detect and analyze email policy violations without impeding communications or business workflows. The data protection service is offered as an add-on solution for customers who use ZixGateway, a policy-based email encryption service that automatically scans and encrypts outbound email containing sensitive information.[21]

Our hospital uses it. Terrible. The most troublesome feature is the complex password requirements. Required password will be difficult or impossible to remember. Then, the password reset process fails. Can't get any work done when that happens.
