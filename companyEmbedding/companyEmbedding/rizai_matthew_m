History[edit]
Workiva was founded as Webfilings in 2008 by three technology entrepreneurs who'd created and run Engineering Animation Inc. (EAI), a 3D computer animation company, also based in Ames—Workiva COO, Martin Vanderploeg, a former engineering professor at Iowa State University (ISU); Jeff Trom, COO; and Matthew M. Rizai, CEO. They sold EAI to EDS/UGS PLM,[3] and it is now a division of Siemens, the German technology multinational.
WebFilings changed its name to Workiva in June 2014 and went public in December 2014 (NYSE: WK).[4][5]
Its customers include Amgen, Colgate Palmolive, Chevron and Google. The company has been recognized as an innovator in its field. A May 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant analysis of the ten leading financial corporate performance management software firms, ranked Workiva in the “Leader” quadrant along with three others: SAP SE, Oracle and BlackLine.[1] In Deloitte's 2015 Technology Fast 500 survey of fastest growing technology companies in America, Workiva ranked fiftieth among all software companies.[6] In February 2017, it won the Business Intelligence Group's BIG Innovation Award.
Applications[edit]
Workiva first SaaS product was SEC reporting software designed to enable corporations to automate their SEC filings by using a proprietary system of document tags and linking.[1] The platform also enabled companies to file electronically directly with the SEC, using the business mark-up language XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language), required by the SEC.[7] A Workiva customer was the first company to file Inline XBRL with the SEC.[8]
The company has since expanded to include other corporate financial and compliance reporting functions, including:

Sarbanes-Oxley reporting and Recovery and Resolution Plans (RRP) - WDesk integrates documentation required for financial statements, risk assessment and forecasts required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act into a single view.[9]

SEC Filing - including EDGAR HTML conversion and xBRL mapping, creating and filing documentation for IPOs, S-1s, 10Ks, 10-Qs, 20-Fs, as well as the reports needed to meet Investor Relations, Mutual Fund reporting regulations.

CAFR and State and Local Reporting - used by municipal securities issuers or agents for preparing documentation for Continuing Disclosures to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and documentation required of state and local education departments to meet mandated guidelines.

Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - WDesk supports most global reporting frameworks that track CSR including Global Responsibility Index, the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.

Internal Reporting - these tasks include compiling management reports, risk assessments, board reports, among others.[1]

Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Ames, Iowa and has domestic offices in Denver and Boulder, CO; Missoula and Bozeman, MT; Chicago, IL; Columbus, GA; Dallas, TX; Miami, FL; New York, NY; Scottsdale, AZ; Seattle, WA; and international offices in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, London, U.K., and Amsterdam, NL.
Related Information[edit]

History[edit]
Workiva was founded as Webfilings in 2008 by three technology entrepreneurs who'd created and run Engineering Animation Inc. (EAI), a 3D computer animation company, also based in Ames—Workiva COO, Martin Vanderploeg, a former engineering professor at Iowa State University (ISU); Jeff Trom, COO; and Matthew M. Rizai, CEO. They sold EAI to EDS/UGS PLM,[3] and it is now a division of Siemens, the German technology multinational.
WebFilings changed its name to Workiva in June 2014 and went public in December 2014 (NYSE: WK).[4][5]
Its customers include Amgen, Colgate Palmolive, Chevron and Google. The company has been recognized as an innovator in its field. A May 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant analysis of the ten leading financial corporate performance management software firms, ranked Workiva in the “Leader” quadrant along with three others: SAP SE, Oracle and BlackLine.[1] In Deloitte's 2015 Technology Fast 500 survey of fastest growing technology companies in America, Workiva ranked fiftieth among all software companies.[6] In February 2017, it won the Business Intelligence Group's BIG Innovation Award.
Applications[edit]
Workiva first SaaS product was SEC reporting software designed to enable corporations to automate their SEC filings by using a proprietary system of document tags and linking.[1] The platform also enabled companies to file electronically directly with the SEC, using the business mark-up language XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language), required by the SEC.[7] A Workiva customer was the first company to file Inline XBRL with the SEC.[8]
The company has since expanded to include other corporate financial and compliance reporting functions, including:

Sarbanes-Oxley reporting and Recovery and Resolution Plans (RRP) - WDesk integrates documentation required for financial statements, risk assessment and forecasts required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act into a single view.[9]

SEC Filing - including EDGAR HTML conversion and xBRL mapping, creating and filing documentation for IPOs, S-1s, 10Ks, 10-Qs, 20-Fs, as well as the reports needed to meet Investor Relations, Mutual Fund reporting regulations.

CAFR and State and Local Reporting - used by municipal securities issuers or agents for preparing documentation for Continuing Disclosures to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and documentation required of state and local education departments to meet mandated guidelines.

Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - WDesk supports most global reporting frameworks that track CSR including Global Responsibility Index, the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.

Internal Reporting - these tasks include compiling management reports, risk assessments, board reports, among others.[1]

Operations[edit]
The company is headquartered in Ames, Iowa and has domestic offices in Denver and Boulder, CO; Missoula and Bozeman, MT; Chicago, IL; Columbus, GA; Dallas, TX; Miami, FL; New York, NY; Scottsdale, AZ; Seattle, WA; and international offices in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Sault Ste.

History[edit]
Workiva was founded as Webfilings in 2008 by three technology entrepreneurs who'd created and run Engineering Animation Inc. (EAI), a 3D computer animation company, also based in Ames—Workiva COO, Martin Vanderploeg, a former engineering professor at Iowa State University (ISU); Jeff Trom, COO; and Matthew M. Rizai, CEO. They sold EAI to EDS/UGS PLM,[3] and it is now a division of Siemens, the German technology multinational.
WebFilings changed its name to Workiva in June 2014 and went public in December 2014 (NYSE: WK).[4][5]
Its customers include Amgen, Colgate Palmolive, Chevron and Google. The company has been recognized as an innovator in its field. A May 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant analysis of the ten leading financial corporate performance management software firms, ranked Workiva in the “Leader” quadrant along with three others: SAP SE, Oracle and BlackLine.[1] In Deloitte's 2015 Technology Fast 500 survey of fastest growing technology companies in America, Workiva ranked fiftieth among all software companies.[6] In February 2017, it won the Business Intelligence Group's BIG Innovation Award.
Applications[edit]
Workiva first SaaS product was SEC reporting software designed to enable corporations to automate their SEC filings by using a proprietary system of document tags and linking.[1] The platform also enabled companies to file electronically directly with the SEC, using the business mark-up language XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language), required by the SEC.[7] A Workiva customer was the first company to file Inline XBRL with the SEC.[8]
The company has since expanded to include other corporate financial and compliance reporting functions, including:

Sarbanes-Oxley reporting and Recovery and Resolution Plans (RRP) - WDesk integrates documentation required for financial statements, risk assessment and forecasts required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act into a single view.[9]

CAFR and State and Local Reporting - used by municipal securities issuers or agents for preparing documentation for Continuing Disclosures to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and documentation required of state and local education departments to meet mandated guidelines.

Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - WDesk supports most global reporting frameworks that track CSR including Global Responsibility Index, the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices.

Internal Reporting - these tasks include compiling management reports, risk assessments, board reports, among others.[1]
