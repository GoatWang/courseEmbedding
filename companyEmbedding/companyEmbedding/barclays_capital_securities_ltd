Macro
A consolidated platform for sales and trading of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivative products.








Understanding the interconnectivity between rates, foreign exchange (FX) and commodities markets has become increasingly important to both our institutional and corporate clients. Our Macro business combines coverage of these asset classes to respond better to their needs.






Barclays has long been a recognised leader in rates and foreign exchange products, and we combine this strength with our focused commodities derivatives and local emerging markets businesses. Our teams, based in financial hubs across the globe, can assist clients with anticipating the impact of macro market moves and events on their portfolios. For example, the impact of central bank interest rate decisions on currency markets, or the relationship between the price of oil and the performance of emerging market currencies.
We strive to give clients the critical short-term and thematic insights they need to effectively manage their portfolios, and partner with them to structure, buy and sell products to meet their hedging and investment goals. Our trading desks specialise in understanding flows across rates, FX and commodities markets, including:

government bonds
interest rate derivatives
inflation-linked products
spot foreign exchange
forwards and options
financial oil
US financial gas
index products







BARX
Our electronic trading platform provides sales and trading capabilities across all major currencies and selected interest rate products. Clients can actively monitor the market, view live prices and execute trades in just a few clicks. Our complementary research and analytical tools help clients stay informed and think creatively about potential investment strategies.
