Our Services : Hedge Fund Marketing : Fund Accounting Administration : Fund Management Solutions








 

























Our value added services  consist of many different pieces. As the hedge fund manager you need to focus  your attention on the buying and selling of securities. Why are hedge fund  managers outsourcing their back-office operations? Simple, focusing on an  in-house back office diverts their attention from their core responsibilities,  namely asset accumulation and building your franchise. Your investors will  appreciate the independent third-party verification of your funds’ operating  results by our CPAs at Strategic Asset Management.  Our individualized services packages tailored  to your fund or situation are crucial to satisfying your customers.   We  greatly reduce expenses and overhead for your fund by eliminating the need for  a large administrative and operational staff.

Goldman Seeding Hedge Fund Startups
Dec 5, 2011 | Hedge Fund Marketing Strategy, Starting a Hedge Fund | 
 

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is turning to the less risky business of providing capital for those who want to start their own hedge funds, reports the Wall Street Journal.
Goldman has raised roughly $600 million from pension funds, wealthy families and large institutions to invest in 10 new hedge funds. Each hedge fund startup is expected to receive between $75 million to $150 million to get off and running. Investors will earn returns based on the success of the funds themselves plus a slice of the hedge fund managers’ fees.
Typically these seeder funds take a 15% to 25% cut of both the annual 2% management fee and 20% of profits earned by hedge fund managers. The actual percentage promised to Goldman investors was not revealed in the Journal article.
Goldman, of course, can gain from a slice of these fees plus the business generated by the hedge funds and sent through Goldman’s trading unit.
The new fund has already invested roughly $100 million in a New York-based hedge fund called Palestra Capital Management LLC. Palestra is a long-short equity fund launched by Jeremy Schiffman and Andrew Immerman, who previously worked for large hedge funds TPG-Axon and SAC Capital.
This “seeding” approach marks a turnaround in strategy for Goldman. Prior to the financial crisis, Goldman and a number of other big banks such as Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. bought hedge funds directly or even set up their own in-house funds. But the financial meltdown hammered returns and resulted in large losses for many of these fledgling funds.
Goldman’s Global Alpha Fund L.P., for example, which was a computer-driven trading fund that had grown as large as $12 billion in assets, closed this past October after investors pulled out money and the fund suffered losses.
The business of seeding hedge funds has heated up this year, however. There are more money managers who have left large banks or other hedge funds looking to start their own funds, and looking to raise capital. An association with a brand-name institution such as Goldman Sachs or Blackstone provides a certain cache and helps with fundraising, particularly from brokers who advise pensions and large institutions on how to allocate their money.

The 2014 Hedge Fund Rising Stars: Jeremy Schiffman

							Schiffman left a partner gig at TPG-Axon in 2011 to found Palestra Capital Management with fellow Hedge Fund Rising Star Andrew Immerman.
						







Palestra Capital Management co-founders Jeremy Schiffman and
    
    Andrew Immerman met in college but became firm friends
    while working in private equity in San Francisco 
    Schiffman for TPG Capital and Immerman for a TPG spin-out. The
    two had remarkably similar backgrounds: Both Immerman and
    Schiffman, 39, graduated from the Wharton School of the
    University of Pennsylvania and worked in investment banking at
    Goldman Sachs Group. After a stint at TPG, Schiffman, who grew
    up in Miami, was a prelaunch hire at TPG-Axon Capital
    Management, the New Yorkbased hedge fund firm founded in
    2004 by former Goldman proprietary trader Dinakar Singh, with
    backing from TPG. Schiffman stayed with TPG-Axon, where he was
    a partner, until 2011, when he left to form New Yorkbased
    Palestra with Immerman. The $900 million, long-short equity,
    value-focused, event-driven fund has funding from Goldman and
    several TPG Capital partners.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
