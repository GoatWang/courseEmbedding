FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Nomination Title: New Product Launch: National Internet Exchange Drove 137% More Leads and New Business

1. Tell the story of this nominated marketing campaign for the judges (up to 525 words). Describe the genesis, planning, execution, and results to date of your campaign. If applicable, remember to describe what's unique or innovative about your campaign:  TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION

Following a successful IPO in January of 2013, CyrusOne was in a rapid growth phase and needed to continue to expand their brand visibility and generate a large increase in number and quality of leads to fill their sales pipeline and support several new data centers around the US and Europe. They needed to do this at a reasonable cost, in part to make sure that their financial results continued to be very attractive to the financial markets. On May 16, 2013, CyrusOne developed and launched the National Internet Exchange – a platform that enables high-performance, low-cost data transfer and accessibility for customers and unites 12 state-of-the-art CyrusOne sites in Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, and Phoenix.

To help the success of the launch, CyrusOne partnered with KEO Marketing, Inc. to provide B2B inbound marketing solutions that would expand online visibility for prospective customers and deliver the most qualified sales leads at a profitable cost. Both CyrusOne and KEO Marketing knew that the best way to launch this product to a senior level IT audience was to deploy a comprehensive integrated marketing campaign that would tell the story about how this new technology transforms an enterprise’s ability to connect their business users and their customers in real time.

The new launch campaign included several strategies:

Content Marketing
	Mobile Advertising
	Corporate Blogging
	SEM – Search Engine Marketing
	SEO – Search Engine Optimization
	Social Media
	Public Relations

KEO Marketing launched and managed the entirety of the campaign over a two-month period with a continued secondary focus through the end of the calendar year. The marketing efforts drove the following substantial results:

• Drove more than 160 new qualified enterprise level leads within the two month time frame
	• Drove 17% of all new leads for the year
	• In 2013 the company gained more than 640% more impressions and 328% more click-throughs with only a 64% increase in budget
	• 137% more website and phone leads year over year
	• Cost per acquisition decreased by 31%
	• Mobile leads increased and accounted for 27% of CyrusOne.com’s impressions
	• Click through rate was 184% better than desktop PPC
	• Mobile engagement increased and accounted for 50% of clicks from PPC campaigns and made up 17% of all new leads
	• Natural search visits increased 72% for the year
	• Form submissions from SEO increased 83%
	• Phone calls from SEO increased 43%
	• Total leads from SEO increased 78%
	• In Q4, 2013 85% of new customer leases included the National IX.

The above stats are proof that the combined efforts of KEO Marketing and CyrusOne resulted in substantial campaign results and a very successful product launch.

Upload a collection of supporting files and web addresses to our server to provide more background information to the judges. You may upload any number of attachments and URLs through the "Add Attachments, Videos, or Links to This Entry" link above. (Do NOT list your URLs below.)

	 

2. Provide a brief biography of the leader of the team that planned and executed this marketing campaign (up to 125 words):

Scott Brueggeman is Chief Marketing Officer of CyrusOne. His responsibilities include worldwide strategic marketing, branding, public relations, and advertising. Scott's marketing experience includes Fortune 50 firms, as well as smaller high-growth companies. Under his leadership, the company received several awards of distinction from the American Marketing Association and Business Marketing Association.

Company Summary


CyrusOne is a global enterprise colocation provider, dedicated to increasing the availability and efficiency of our customer's mission-critical business applications and safeguarding their data in our highly secure data centers.

Improved Reliability - Controlled Costs
Our clients know that building and managing a secure, reliable data center requires a long-term commitment and a heavy up-front investment. Even then, it's a constant challenge to match capacity to the fluctuating demands of today's fast-paced business environment. And there are other considerations, such as the exhaustive task of recruiting, training and retaining outstanding technical talent, and the increased risk posed by unpredictable support costs.

Infrastructure On Demand - Scalability
Specialists in the delivery of infrastructure and professional services on-demand, CyrusOne quickly and precisely meets your changing business needs, eliminating the revenue losses associated with under-investment, and releasing valuable capital tied up in excess IT capacity.

Revenue enhancement, cost avoidance, and a smooth path to expansion: all immediate, concrete, and measurable. It's no wonder so many companies choose CyrusOne to enhance their existing IT resources, and leverage the redundancy and security of our world-class Enterprise Data Center to host and manage their mission-critical data, servers, and networks ...around the clock, and around the globe.

Your Competitive Edge
Above all, CyrusOne is committed to delivering the peace of mind that comes from connecting with your customers, partners, and suppliers across a secure, reliable network, and to helping you regain the competitive edge that comes from concentrating on running your business, and not dealing with IT headaches.

Unsurpassed Customer Service
At CyrusOne, we're dedicated to doing literally whatever it takes to meet the demands and exceed the expectations of our clients. It's ingrained in our culture. We have consistently maintained a 98% overall customer satisfaction rating year over year.

(“CyrusOne”) (NASDAQ:CONE) announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire four data center facilities and two work area recovery facilities (collectively, the “Facilities”) serving the New York metropolitan area through the acquisition of Cervalis Holdings LLC (“Cervalis”), a privately-held owner and operator of data centers. When completed, the transaction will expand CyrusOne’s existing portfolio to 31 data centers across 12 distinct markets (10 cities in the U.S., London and Singapore).“We are really excited about this transaction and expect it to create significant strategic opportunities for our customers and benefits to our stockholders. I have known Mike Boccardi and Larry DeGeorge at Cervalis for many years and have always admired the team they have assembled and the financial services focused platform they have created in the New York Metro area,” said Gary Wojtaszek, president and chief executive officer of CyrusOne. “Their focus on serving the needs of the largest financial enterprise customers in the world will be a valuable complement to CyrusOne, and we look forward to working together to continue to grow the combined business and create value for our shareholders.”Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, a subsidiary of CyrusOne will acquire Cervalis for approximately $400 million, excluding transaction-related expenses, in an all cash transaction. Simultaneously, CyrusOne has obtained financing commitments from KeyBank and intends to finance the acquisition in a manner that takes into consideration balance sheet flexibility, credit ratings impact and accretion to shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the next 45 to 60 days, subject to the fulfillment of customary closing conditions.Transaction HighlightsWhen completed the transaction will add four Tier 3+ data center facilities and two standalone work area recovery facilities serving the New York metropolitan region into CyrusOne’s existing data center platform. The Cervalis Facilities currently comprise more than 500,000 gross square feet of space, including more than 125,000 colocation square feet and over 100,000 square feet of work area recovery space.“We have known CyrusOne and the management team for many years and are glad that we will be able to join the companies together,” said Michael Boccardi, president and chief executive officer of Cervalis. “The combined strength will provide an opportunity to further accelerate the success we have had in the financial services industry and provide our existing customers the ability to grow outside of the New York metropolitan region into CyrusOne’s global platform.”In 2014 Cervalis generated revenues of nearly $70 million, with approximately two-thirds being derived from colocation services, and the remainder from interconnection, enhanced services, and work area recovery products. Over the last five years Cervalis has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of approximately 14%. As of the end of 2014, 77% of the colocation square feet within the Cervalis Facilities was utilized. In addition to the currently available raised floor space, it currently has capacity under shell to deliver an incremental 55,000 colocation square feet.The transaction is expected to provide additional benefits to CyrusOne, including the following:Enhanced Geographic Diversification: The combination will greatly enhance CyrusOne’s geographic diversification, establishing a presence in the Northeast with the addition of a platform that includes 4 data centers in the New York metropolitan market.Access to a High Quality Enterprise Customer Base: Cervalis serves approximately 220 enterprise customers, with a particular niche servicing some of the world’s largest financial institutions, including several Fortune 1000 companies. Approximately two-thirds of its fourth quarter 2014 revenue came from customers within the financial services industry.Strengthened Product Portfolio: The transaction provides a set of interconnected data centers in one of the world’s largest internet hubs, further enhancing the attractiveness of CyrusOne’s National IX platform. Access to a high-end enhanced services offering provides a platform that can be selectively leveraged across CyrusOne’s existing customer base to accelerate growth.Financial ImpactThe acquisition is expected to be accretive to Normalized FFO per diluted share and unit in the first year after completion. Additionally, CyrusOne expects to increase utilization of the data centers which is also expected to create additional long-term accretion. The Company will provide updated guidance for the year subsequent to closing. Additional details surrounding the transaction will be provided on CyrusOne’s first quarter 2015 earnings call on Thursday, May 7.Financial and Legal AdvisorsMorgan Stanley and Allen & Company LLC served as financial advisors to CyrusOne, and DLA Piper served as CyrusOne’s legal advisor. DH Capital served as the financial advisor to Cervalis and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman served as Cervalis’ legal advisor.Safe HarborThis release contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
