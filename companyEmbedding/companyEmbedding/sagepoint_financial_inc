THE SAGEPOINT PERSPECTIVE

Story

Stability







Embracing Independence & Empowering Top Advisors
Since SagePoint was launched in 1970, we have been thoroughly committed as a firm to strengthening and supporting the advisors we serve. Along with delivering the right tools and the right systems to get the job done, we listen carefully to our advisors. This helps ensure that we are providing you with what you need to succeed and that you have the freedom to run your business the way you know it works best. It’s a commitment.
The results of this approach are reflected in the numbers. More than 1,900 advisors now call SagePoint home and they generate an average annual GDC in excess of $178,000 with a total of $37 billion in total client assets. With an impressive 98% retention rate and an average tenure of 10.7 years, we find that when advisors come to us, they stay and tend to stay for a long time. For over 45 years, SagePoint has been the first choice for advisors.

When an advisor selects to affiliate with us, they tend to stay for a very long time—on average for well over a decade and often to the end of their career.

Top producers—and our advisors average over $178,000 in annual GDC—like what they’ve found at SagePoint because of our culture of collaboration and support.



The Options You Want with the Tools You Need
SagePoint puts advisors in control by providing them with both the flexibility to run their business the way they want and the tools to get the job done. While many broker-dealers offer narrow definitions of what open architecture means to them, we are focused on what it means to you. We understand that you have a vision to take your already successful practice to an even better place. The bottom line is that you know the best way to manage your own business.
Your ability to excel in your practice is also tied to having the right tools to do what you know you need to do. That’s why SagePoint is dedicated to developing sophisticated programs, technologies and support teams necessary for success. These include a suite of solutions for business planning, streamlined offices, portfolio management, and a wide range of powerful resources integrated into one dynamic resource center.

Our liberating “open architecture” approach is designed to maximize your flexibility and support so that it fits the way you want to do business.

Choose from a wide range of affiliation options and we’ll help ensure that you are in your comfort zone: Independent, Branch or RIA models.



Advisor-Centric with Advanced Tools & Exceptional Attention
In every way, SagePoint is advisor-centric. As one of our affiliated advisors, you can always count on advanced technology, business-building assistance, learning opportunities, and extensive product listings. Our support begins at the moment you choose to join our team and continues throughout your career with us and even beyond. Now the industry benchmark, our succession and continuity programs help you reap the rewards of a job well done.
We are confident that the financial professionals we serve enjoy the best of all worlds—big-firm resources with small-firm attention. That’s because we are part of one of the largest truly independent broker-dealer networks in the industry and yet have maintained a family feel with a genuine open-door policy that encourages advisor input and helps shape the firm’s direction. We invite you to carefully consider the many benefits of SagePoint Financial.

First-Class Support
SagePoint has made an art of listening to advisors in order to deliver the first-class support that top producers require. Our teams come alongside you to help ensure that you can deliver the service your clients expect.






Personal Attention | Open Architecture | Sales Support | Pro-Business Compliance




Personal Attention
We are confident that the advisors we serve enjoy the best of both worlds—big-firm resources with small-firm attention. As a member of Advisor Group, one of the largest truly independent broker-dealer networks in the industry, we have the tools you need to excel in today’s business environment. Importantly, we also deliver hands-on, customized service.
And it starts at the top. Every member of our senior management team has decades of experience in the industry and promotes an open door policy. When you need to talk to anyone about any issue, you have the complete assurance you will be heard.
We Listen and Respond
But we go further than that. We also have a number of advisory boards that keep us well connected to our advisors. Some of our most significant advances each year come from listening carefully to them and taking the appropriate action as a result. Our advisors help direct our path.
At the end of the day, we put advisors first in all of our thinking and planning. If you’ve ever felt abandoned or ignored by your home office, be prepared for a new and refreshing collaborative experience with SagePoint.



Advisors in Their Own Voice: Taylor Freeman, SagePoint Financial
Ready to Talk?



Open Architecture
For years, broker-dealers have been forcing their advisors into their mold. Making them change their own proven approaches and systems to conform to corporate structures that were set years ago, but possibly no longer effective. We know that what works for one advisor might not be a good fit for another. It’s the reason our advisors appreciate our steadfast commitment to an open architecture platform. And it informs every decision we make.
The bottom line is that we believe you know the best way to manage and grow your business. Because of that belief, we embrace your vision and want you to do business your way. While many broker-dealers offer narrow definitions of what open architecture means to them, SagePoint is focused on what it means to you. We understand that you have a vision to take your already successful practice to an even better place.
Flexibility & Customization
To us, open architecture is more than a philosophy. It’s an everyday reality. One that lets you define your ideal approach to business and then delivers powerful options that make it happen. Our open architecture encourages you to:

Set up and manage your practice in the way that works best for you
Work with the systems you prefer and we’ll look to integrate them into ours
Market yourself to your customers and prospects in the way you know has historically produced results
Offer more products from more sponsor firms and choose from two custody/clearing options
Define a customized succession plan that makes sense today and delivers real benefits for the future





We believe you know the best way to manage and grow your business. Because of that, we embrace your vision and want you to do business your way.

Sales Support
Our Internal Sales Desk, together with our Advanced Sales/Qualified Plans, Investment Advisory Services, Insurance Consulting Services and Retirement Plan Consulting Services teams, provide advisors with comprehensive and consultative sales support across all product lines. Our goal is to offer solution-driven support across the spectrum and throughout all phases of the client engagement process.
The collaborative nature of our sales support teams is central to our ability to effectively support our advisors by identifying opportunities that add true value every time we have a conversation with an advisor. Our sales and education efforts across all product lines are designed to help our advisors, in whatever way possible, deliver quality investment strategies and advice to their clients.
Retirement Plan Consulting Team
Our Retirement Plan Consulting Services Team (RPSC) can help you capture your share of the trillions of dollars that are currently in play in the retirement plans marketplace. Part of  Advisor Group’s dynamic sales organization, RPCS provides the focused support and concrete tools designed to help you thrive in the retirement plan marketplace.
Don’t go it alone trying to navigate the retirement planning landscape. RPCS delivers guidance that’s not one-size-fits-all and it is just a phone call away. Our advisors also have complete access to our Advanced Planning and Plan Design Support teams.
From regulations to legislation, our experts assess the impact on your practice and deliver easy-to-interpret updates via our Advanced Sales Desk—helping you capitalize on information so you can deliver value to your clients.
Benchmarking Tools
There’s a lot of competition out there in the retirement plan marketplace, so differentiation is critical. Deploying our state-of-the-art fee benchmarking programs, RFP comparisons, investment analytics, and compliance tools will give you the edge you need to break away from the pack.
Advanced Sales
Our firm is unique in the independent broker-dealer space in that we have in-house attorneys available to provide subject matter expertise and assist you with case design strategies and complex business issues. Although the attorneys don’t provide tax advice, they do understand and capitalize on the tax attributes of the products you offer by providing tax information designed to help your clients make informed decisions.
Each of our Advanced Sales attorneys bring decades of industry experience to the table and their advice is objective, independent and neutral regarding providers. Their areas of expertise include estate planning, charitable giving, business insurance and non-qualified benefit planning. They also offer expert-level knowledge on everything from IRAs to ESOPs and often challenging subjects such as long-term care, Medicaid and combination products, as well as alternative investments.



Our collaborative nature is central to our ability to effectively support our advisors by identifying opportunities that add true value in every area of their practices.
Ready to Talk?



Pro-Business Compliance
Compliance is a priority at SagePoint and we provide the expert consultation, support and tools you need, designed to help avoid regulatory issues, reduce complaints and manage risk. Our commitment extends beyond the routine supervisory duties and branch exams to include a full suite of resources that enable you to move much of your compliance burden to us.
The bottom line is that we are pro-business with the full intention of helping your practice succeed. It’s not about introducing obstacles, it is all about creating opportunities.
Advertising Review
Personalized advertising consultation that provides access to an advertising analyst is also available just by picking up the phone. Your analyst will guide you through the steps to help ensure that all marketing initiatives meet FINRA guidelines. We also deliver our advisors an online sales practice manual for 24/7 access to current information on compliance issues. This valuable resource is backed by a dedicated phone support staff available during regular business hours.
Also, to assist you in transitioning to a fully paperless office, we supply guidance that can support and enhance your efforts to improve productivity, efficiency and accuracy in record keeping when implementing an electronic storage solution.
And to keep you up-to-date, the latest developments are covered in-person at our annual compliance meeting. We also enable you to meet your annual requirements online so that you can determine what best fits your schedule.
 



The bottom-line is that we operate with the full intention of helping you succeed. It’s not about introducing obstacles, it is all about creating opportunities.

Built for Flexibility
SagePoint Financial combines superior strength, service and support to help ensure that advisors are well-positioned to meet the needs of their clients while building long-term, sustainable practices. And we do it your way.






Setting the Standard | Our Strengths | Service & Support | Transition Support




Setting the Standard
If you’re ready for a partner with the experience, resources and drive to promote your firm in an ever-changing world, then SagePoint Financial is ready to welcome you. We offer a fresh take on the broker-dealer experience and it is why for over 45 years motivated advisors like you have elected to make us their home.
Raising the Bar
It starts with the fact that we’ve raised the bar when it comes to what you can expect from your independent broker-dealer. Our approach has been to transform the way we lead into the way we listen. We see our clients as collaborators. And we bring the weight of a rich heritage as a company into strategies that work both for today and tomorrow.
Whether it’s by providing service that anticipates your needs, offering adaptable solutions that easily conform to your practice, or delivering evolving technologies that enable you to become a leader, as your world changes so do we.
Your Voice Matters
When you choose to affiliate with SagePoint, you’ll enjoy the best of both worlds: big-firm resources with a small-firm feel. That’s because while we are part of one of the largest independent broker-dealer networks in the industry, we’re also driven to be the most flexible, the most nimble, and the most collaborative broker-dealer for your business. And that demands ensuring that your ideas and opinions are always heard and, in turn, influence our course of action.
To us, listening effectively means giving you direct access to senior management and assigning a regional executive dedicated specifically to you and your needs. It means maintaining advisor-lead committees to represent you and provide early input on important issues. And it means a responsive, knowledgeable home-office team that makes you their top priority.
But the bottom line is that in everything we do, and with every step we take, we put the advisor first. We put you first. And we invite you to join our team.



Advisor Group means QUALITY. And this is exactly what quality means to us.
Ready to Talk?



Our Strengths
We understand that all broker-dealers share some things in common. But the features and perspectives that separate them can be critical. For SagePoint, it’s a belief in partnership and a true open-door policy combined with advanced technology and service that sets us apart.
Collaborative Approach We’ve transformed the way we lead…into the way we listen. Our approach with advisors is to see them as collaborators and we are constantly evolving so that as their world changes, so does ours.
Compensation Analysis To help you make the most informed decision on whether a move to SagePoint is right for you, we’ll provide you with a commission schedule and comparative analysis specific to your numbers without any obligation.
Affiliation Options We offer a wide range of affiliation options to ensure that you are reaching your goals according to your own plan. Choose from our Independent, Branch, Employee, and Registered Investment Advisor models. Our goal is to come alongside you and empower what you know works best, not squeeze you into an uncomfortable model.
Clearing Choices SagePoint offers two of the industry’s most powerful clearing firms so that you can move accounts in the direction that is easiest and most effective for you. Choose between Pershing and National Financial Services. This means minimal disruption for your staff and a seamless move for clients.
Business Development Plot the roadmap of your future by developing a customized business plan with our dedicated team and then take advantage of premier coaching that is designed to help you double your business. As a firm we are committed to your growth.
Fee-Based Solutions While SagePoint supports all business models, we can help open new opportunities through our comprehensive Investment Advisory Services. These fee-based management solutions are robust and readily available.
Common-Sense Compliance Our commitment extends beyond routine supervisory duties and branch exams to include a full suite of resources that enables you to rely on our expert team for much of your compliance and regulatory needs.
Succession Planning Working with our expert succession and continuity planning consultants, you can create a plan that will ensure that you are able to protect and benefit from the business into which you invested so many years of your life.



Advisor Group means SUPPORT. And this is exactly what support means to us.
Ready to Talk?



Service & Support
As a broker-dealer that adapts to your needs, SagePoint empowers advisors to reach new levels of success through a true partnership of mutual strength and respect and we do that in very practical ways that impact your everyday operations.
It starts with offering total support through live and experienced telephone customer service featuring extended hours. You can operate with the confidence that we will respond quickly and appropriately to your needs. When we don’t have the answers at our fingertips, we will immediately mobilize as a team to find what you are looking for.

The information presented is neither an offer to sell nor the solicitation of an offer to buy any security, which can be made only by prospectus or official documents. Such documents explain all the implications and risks of the respective offering of the securities to which it relates including risks, fees and expenses. Prospectuses and/or offering documents should be read carefully prior to investing.
Alternative investments are highly speculative and not suitable for all investors. Alternative asset classes are typically more volatile than investments in other asset classes such as equities and fixed income. This volatility may result in significant price fluctuation and loss of some or all principal invested. Additionally, alternative investments may be illiquid and in some cases can create tax liabilities. There is no assurance that the stated objectives will be met. Several of these programs available are for sophisticated investors only or may be limited to established accredited clients.
Product availability changes from time to time. Contact us directly if you have questions about specific products.

Fee-Based Practices Services
Fee-based asset management emphasizes the quality of the relationships you have with your clients. By considering all of your clients’ investment needs, you are able to provide more comprehensive services and support to help them reach their goals. In addition, fee-based asset management enables you to offer a wider selection of products and services that attract clients with more sophisticated needs.

These reports provide the data for creating an actionable business plan with real time client information. Details on AUM for both retail and investment advisory business can be viewed on both summary and detail levels. Advanced data analysis capabilities allow advisors to streamline data flows and create reports to spotlight inefficiencies, validate resource expenditures, or conduct cost/benefit studies.

Email Services available for our advisors’ business-related email communications are Redtail and Smarsh.
Forefield Marketing Resources provides access to an online library of more than 4,000 pre-approved educational and sales resources at no additional charge.
MyProfile allows advisors to view their licensing profile as well as add state licenses, insurance licenses and appointments.

The Power to Excel
Whether its clearing options or delivering a robust lineup of investment products, insurance services and alternative investments, SagePoint puts you in the driver’s seat with the resources you need to satisfy client expectations.






Dual Clearing | Investment Products | Insurance Services | Women Advisors




Dual Clearing
SagePoint is committed to supporting our advisors in the way they are most comfortable rather than making them conform to our preferences. To that end we offer dual clearing arrangements through both Pershing and National Financial Services. Our goal is to make any transition as seamless as possible to both our advisors and the clients they serve.
Pershing
Pershing has been a leading global provider of financial business solutions for 75 years, and serves many of the world’s most respected financial organizations. In addition to SIPC protection, accounts held at Pershing have coverage in excess of SIPC limits through Lloyd’s of London. Pershing’s parent company, the Bank of New York Mellon, has $27.6 trillion in assets under custody or administration and $1.6 trillion under management.*
Our relationship with Pershing offers you access to NetX360, Pershing’s revolutionary technology platform providing the tools needed to manage clients’ accounts, deliver first-rate service, and develop new sales and revenue opportunities. NetX360 offers one complete solution to efficiently manage your entire business, whether commission or fee-based.
National Financial Services (NFS)
National Financial Services is a leading provider of clearing and custody solutions to more than 300 broker-dealers throughout the United States. Established in 1983, NFS, a Fidelity Investments company, is one of the largest providers of brokerage services with more than 25 million brokerage accounts representing $3.2 trillion in assets. Its parent company, Fidelity Investments is one of the world’s largest providers of financial services, with custodial assets of $4.6 trillion, including managed assets of $1.9 trillion.*
The strength and reputation associated with Fidelity Investments is one of the many reasons SagePoint is pleased to partner with NFS. Our relationship with NFS provides trade execution, clearing, and other related services for your commission and fee-based brokerage accounts and offers access to a dedicated service model, leading investment solutions, and access to Streetscape—a powerful global trading platform.
Pershing, NFS and their affiliates are not affiliated with SagePoint Financial or Advisor Group.
* Dates as of (12-31-14)



SagePoint is committed to making sure we support our advisors in the ways they are most comfortable rather than making them conform to our preferences.

Women Advisors
Women FORWARD is Advisor Group’s women’s initiative to foster an environment of success for female advisors and to provide a wide-range of guidance to all advisors looking to enhance their relationships with female clients.
Areas of Focus
Growth: Through our mentorship program and academic curriculum, we will support our female advisors in managing and developing their businesses.
Recruiting: In addition to recruiting existing female advisors, we will support women who choose to be financial advisors as a first or second career, and administrative associates who are on a path to becoming advisors.
Female Clients: In recognition of this growing investor segment, we are dedicated to providing all advisors with the tools and resources to actively—and successfully—engage female clients.
Giving Back: Advisor Group is keenly focused on promoting financial literacy. One way we do this is by working with Junior Achievement USA to provide young people with an opportunity to explore, first-hand, the work of financial advisors. We have also established the Advisor Group Women’s Community Leadership Award, through which we are able to honor a female advisor who has demonstrated outstanding commitment to helping women grow personally, professionally, or financially.
W Forum
This annual conference offers education and networking opportunities for all women affiliated within our broker-dealer network. W Forum features intriguing keynote speakers, advisor-led workshops and an extensive partner exhibit for interacting with industry professionals.
Mentorship
The Women FORWARD Mentorship Program is designed to bring together our network’s top-producing male and female advisors looking to provide real world guidance and share their expertise with female advisors. Central to this flagship program’s success is its focus on collaboration, education, and networking.
Resources
We’ve compiled a library of pre-approved Client Engagement Materials for advisors to take advantage of, as they work with women investors. In addition, we’ve assembled informative resources within our Advisor Materials library that delve into the “what, how and why” of successfully working with women investors. These materials can enhance advisors’ interactions with women investors and help them grow their practices.
For more information about the Women FORWARD initiative, please contact Erica Hinton at WomenForward@advisorgroup.com.



SagePoint has a commitment to fostering success for female advisors, while providing education and tools for all advisors looking to enhance their relationships with female clients.
