CapRocq CoreREIT | Class-A Commercial Real Estate in The U.S. Heartland




































































 















 INVEST NOW


























 





 

CLASS-A COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATEIN THE U.S. HEARTLAND 

Income-producing real estate with expected quarterly payouts. 

 

 


 

 

 

 


 





CapRocq Core REIT provides commercial real estate investment opportunities in underserved markets with attractive cash flow yields.

 


ABOUT

 


The CapRocq team identifies, acquires, owns, and operates a portfolio of commercial properties primarily within the Heartland of the United States, providing Class-A commercial real estate opportunities in underserved markets with attractive cash flow yields.
 
We have a robust pipeline of Class-A commercial investment opportunities and achieve this with our high-caliber team with over 80 years in combined investment experience, proven and profitable investment strategies, and well-established infrastructure.
 
The CapRocq team has acquired and managed $325 million in commercial real estate assets since 2012, executing the same strategy as the REIT, through two prior CapRocq Core funds, Core 1 and Core 2.

 


Learn More About Our Robust Pipeline of Real Estate Investment Opportunities

 SEE INVESTOR DECKQualified Investment Executives
$1.5 billion and over 80 years in combined real estate investment experienceProven Strategy and Robust Deal Flow
Identified, acquired and operated a portfolio of over $325 million for two prior CapRocq Core funds.Strong Track Record of Success
Previous CapRocq Core funds consistently paying out 5% annualized cash distribution to investors.Well-Established Infrastructure
Deep network of contacts, disciplined deal execution and effective portfolio management. 










CLASS-A COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE REIT

 



Our goal is to own a portfolio of commercial properties located primarily in the Heartland of the United States.  We believe focusing on stable investments with quality renovations in underserved markets where cap rates are less volatile and yields are attractive will create significant opportunity.
 
CapRocq Core REIT is uniquely positioned for success because we will implement a successful strategy used for two prior active funds totaling more than $325 million, and we have already identified properties that we initially aim to acquire.  Long term, CapRocq will seek to grow and expand our asset categories and uplist to a major exchange.
 
MARKET OPPORTUNITY
The Real Estate category now represents 5% of the overall value of all companies among 10 industry sectors and is now a distinct classification higher than telecom services and utilities as defined by Standard & Poor.   Investors are now more likely to view real estate as a foundational component of modern portfolio theory leading to higher allocations of dollars to real estate which could represent more than $30 billion in new money into the asset class*.
 
CapRocq Core REIT’s strategy is to seize this market opportunity with a team possessing over $1.5 billion in combined real estate investment experience, a deep network of contacts who can be tapped for deal sourcing and due diligence, disciplined deal execution, and a portfolio management process that allows for close and effective monitoring of our investments.
 
We believe that in the long-term, we will be able to consistently identify an attractive pipeline of new properties in our target markets for purposes of acquiring, owning, and operating our investments, which we expect will enable us to grow our platform.

This presentation is not, and should not be assumed to be, complete. This presentation has been prepared to assist interested parties in making an evaluation of CapRocq and does not purport to contain all of the information that may be relevant. In all cases, interested parties should conduct their own investigation and analysis of CapRocq and the data set forth in this presentation and other information provided by or on behalf of CapRocq. In addition, certain of the information contained herein may be derived from information provided by industry sources. CapRocq believes that such information is accurate and that the sources from which it has been obtained are reliable. CapRocq cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information, however, and has not independently verified such information. The information presented herein remains subject to change. Statements in this presentation are made as of the date of this presentation unless stated otherwise.
This presentation also contains statements that, to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “should,” “expect,” “could,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “predict,” and/or “potential.” The forward-looking statements included herein are based upon CapRocq’s current expectations, plans, estimates, assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond CapRocq’s control. Although CapRocq believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, CapRocq’s actual results and performance and the value of its securities could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements due to the impact of many factors including, but not limited to, risks and uncertainties detailed in the “Risk Factors” in the Risk Factors section of CapRocq’s Final Offering Circular on Form 253G2 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated March 17, 2017, and other discussions of risk factors contained in CapRocq’s periodic filings or supplements to the offering circular. CapRocq claims the safe harbor protection for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. CapRocq undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such information for any reason after the date of this presentation, unless required by law.
In addition, in considering any prior performance information, prospective investors should bear in mind that past results are not necessarily indicative of future results, and there can be no assurance that results comparable to those discussed herein will be achieved. This presentation is not an Offering Circular for CapRocq. Investors must review the Offering Circular for CapRocq and sign a subscription agreement attesting that they reviewed the Offering Circular before making an investment in CapRocq.




CapRocq Core Risk Factors

Prospective  investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the Company's common  stock involves a high, and sometimes speculative, degree  of risk, and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate  the risks of the investment. An investment in  our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of  and to withstand the total loss of their investment. Prospective investors  should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to  purchase shares. 
It is impossible  to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares  of the Company's common stock because of  general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate, the  risks associated with the types of properties the Company intends to acquire,  and certain tax risks, among other risks. These risks may be exacerbated by the  additional risks associated with the specific properties that the Company  acquires and the ownership structure of the Investment. Such specific risks  include, but are not limited to, high vacancy rates, tenants in possession but  not paying rent, tenants paying rent but who have "gone dark," properties that  need substantial capital improvements and/or repositioning in their local  markets, properties that are not generating income, and risks relating to joint  venture and co-investor structures. In addition, prospective investors must  rely solely upon the Advisor to identify Investment opportunities and to  negotiate any debt financing. Prospective investors who are unwilling to rely  solely on the Advisor should not invest in our shares. 
Each prospective  investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering, and  should consult with his own legal, tax, and financial advisors with respect  thereto prior to investing in shares of the Company's common stock. Examples of  a few risks in this offering are the following:
• Upon raising the minimum  offering amount, we will only own one Investment
• Our Advisor may not be  successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities.
• Investments in real  estate-related assets can be speculative.
• Adverse economic  conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and, as a result,  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize  appreciation in the value of our Investments.
• REIT distribution  requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.
• We may have conflicts of  interest with our Advisor and other affiliates, which could result in investment  decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.
• We have used and may  continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or  interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness, which increases  our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in  foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments.
• A limit on the percentage  of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business  combination, which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium  price for their stock.
• The price of our common  stock may fluctuate significantly.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for CapRocq Core REIT, Inc.'s Common Stock, therefore our  Company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its Common  Stock will develop or be sustained after this offering, or how the development  of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock. For a  complete discussion of risks, please refer to the Form 1-A. A Form 1-A offering  circular relating to these securities has been qualified by the Securities and  Exchange Commission. You may obtain a copy of the final offering circular here: https://www.theasmx.com/investment/caprocqcorereit The Form-1-A contains  forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks  and uncertainties. These forward looking statements include statements  regarding commercialization plans, projected timelines, etc. Actual results and  the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these  forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those  discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the  offering circular. This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the  solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these  securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or  sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the  securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. No money or other  consideration is being solicited in connection with this document, and if sent  in response, will not be accepted. Any person's indication of interest involves  no obligation or commitment of any kind.

CapRocq Automotive, LLC (“CapRocq”) is an asset management company focused on origina¬tion, underwriting and oversight of commercial real property used by operators of multi-site, multi-franchised automotive dealerships located in attractive markets throughout the U.S.

W. P. Carey Inc. is a publicly traded REIT (NYSE: WPC) that provides long-term sale-leaseback and build-to-suit financing for companies worldwide and manages an investment portfolio of approximately $15.2 billion.
Together, we help auto dealers access their personal capital tied up in real estate assets by acquiring properties for full market value and leasing them back to the dealer through sale-leaseback transactions:
Our financing solutions enable dealers to convert a depreciating asset into working capital they can use immediately for higher returns on cash, diversifying personal net worth or estate planning.
We are long-term partners for future growth that will provide expansion capital.
Having closed over $80 million in retail automotive dealership sale-leaseback transactions since 2012, CapRocq and W. P. Carey have combined resources and expertise to provide dealers flexible and creative solutions for sale-leaseback transactions with speed and efficiency.
Our philosophy is to work closely with each dealer to find a customized solution that meets individual needs.

CapRocq is an Arkansas-based real estate partnership focused on acquiring real estate assets in key sectors, including office, industrial, retail and automotive. CapRocq has successfully launched two ventures: CapRocq Core Real Estate Fund L.P. and CapRocq Automotive LLC, an asset management company focused on origina¬tion, underwriting and oversight of commercial real property used by operators of multi-site, multi-franchised automotive dealerships located in attractive markets throughout America. Franklin McLarty and Kevin Huchingson are co-founders of CapRocq.
