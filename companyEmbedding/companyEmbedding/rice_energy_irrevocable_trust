Rice Energy +8% as family trust sells 5M shares to pay down credit line - Rice Energy Inc (NYSE:RICE) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Rice Energy +8% as family trust sells 5M shares to pay down credit lineDec. 23, 2015  3:48 PM ET|About: Rice Energy Inc (RICE)|By: Carl Surran, SA News Editor  Rice Energy (RICE +7.9%) is rising after it said a trust formed by CEO Daniel Rice and other family members sold 5M of RICE shares earlier this week to pay down loans dating back to the company's IPO nearly two years ago. Before the block sale by the Rice Energy Irrevocable Trust, no one in the Rice family had sold any of their shares since its January 2014 IPO, the company said following yesterday's close; proceeds from the sale were used to repay a $50M line of credit extended to the trust by Morgan Stanley to pay taxes and other expenses resulting from the IPO. Citing recent volatility for energy stocks in general, RICE said the trust determined that repaying the loans now would help it avoid potential margin calls in the future and the possible impact a forced sale could have on the stock price.

Ohio Utica Shale






Rice Energy trust sells 5 million shares of stock to reduce debt

	From a press release from Rice Energy, a key driller in Ohio's Utica Shale:

CANONSBURG, Pa., Dec. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Rice Energy Inc. (NYSE: RICE) ("Rice") today reported that on December 21, 2015, the Rice Energy Irrevocable Trust ("Rice Trust", the "Trust"), a private Trust established for the benefit of members of the Rice family, executed a block sale of 5,000,000 shares of Rice common stock to pay down a line of credit extended to the Rice Trust by Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association ("Morgan Stanley").

Daniel J. Rice IV, Chief Executive Officer, said, "Prior to this transaction, the Rice family had not sold a single share of Rice Energy since the family formed the company in 2007. In order to pay taxes and expenses incurred as a result of the Rice Energy IPO in 2014, the Rice Trust obtained two loans, the terms of which the Trust has been in compliance with at all times. However, in light of current volatile financial market conditions, the Rice Trust determined that repaying the loans preemptively in an orderly and structured manner was the most prudent path towards preventing a potential margin call event in the future that could possibly detrimentally impact Rice Energy's share price performance. As Rice Energy's largest shareholder, in no way does this stock sale reflect the Rice family's commitment to Rice Energy or its view of Rice Energy's future performance potential."

	As disclosed in a Schedule 13D/A filed on December 21, 2015, on December 15, 2014, the Rice Trust entered into a line of credit agreement (the "Line of Credit Agreement") with Morgan Stanley for up to $33,000,000, and a Financial Assets Security Agreement (the "Security Agreement"), pursuant to which the Rice Trust pledged 6,750,000 shares of Rice common stock as security for its obligations to Morgan Stanley under the Line of Credit Agreement.

	Upon closing of the sale, the Rice Trust intends to repay in full and retire the line of credit, at which time the remaining shares of Rice common stock not sold in the block sale will be released from their pledge under the Security Agreement.

About Rice Energy

	Rice Energy Inc. is an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian Basin. For more information, please visit our website at www.riceenergy.com.
