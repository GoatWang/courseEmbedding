Patient-centered cancer care matters.We bring the voice of the cancer patient – their values, preferences and experiences – into the care planning process to improve survival and quality of life. 
        





     





Improve outcomes with comprehensive patient care plans.
Carevive’s expertise is clinically integrating electronic patient-reported and clinical data with scientific evidence into a care planning process that improves clinical outcomes.
We collaborate with our health system clients to facilitate shared decision-making and to support both clinicians and patients to prevent and manage symptoms and other effects of cancer, both during active treatment and during survivorship and palliative care.

Gain insights to cancer patient real-world experiences.
The cancer journey remains elusive to us all. With our provider organizations clients, we are building an invaluable real-world experience registry of cancer patients. This registry is used to continuously refine our offering, provide insights to our clinician clients to improve patient care, and inform life science and other cancer stakeholder organizations.

Jeannine Brant, PhD, APRN, AOCNBillings Clinic








Dr. Jeannine M. Brant is an oncology clinical nurse specialist, pain consultant, and nurse scientist for the Billings Clinic in Montana. Dr. Brant’s repertoire blends her clinical expertise in pain and symptom management with her program of research that includes improving patient symptoms and focusing on nursing-sensitive indicators that lead to quality nursing and interdisciplinary care.
In 1990, Dr. Brant developed the Women Reaching for Wellness Program, an American Indian outreach education program, on seven Indian reservations in Montana and one in Wyoming focused on cancer prevention in American Indian women. When the project began, American Indians were reluctant to discuss cancer for fear they would get the disease. Over a 15-year period, an award-winning film called “Standing Strong Against the Cancer Enemy” was produced (more than 400 copies distributed nationwide), cancer prevention and education were offered to more than 20,000 women per year, and a screening program was added through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Initially only five women received mammograms per year and the five-year breast cancer survival rate was approximately 65 percent. The program enrolled more than 200 women per year for mammograms when screening started and the breast cancer survival rates have increased.

From Care Plan Template to Survivorship Program: Overcoming Challenges and Demonstrating Value









  



  



 “ I can’t say enough about the Carevive Care Planning System… I think its extremely helpful in making the visit much more complete and efficient …With all the issues cancer patients can have, there’s only so much time one has in a day, so the care plan improves efficiency by helping me 'cut to the chase’ and highlight the top issues from both the patient and clinical perspective, focus the visit on these, and then provide them with targeted resources and referrals for their individual concerns and needs. Dr. Susan Minton - Breast Medical Oncologist, Moffitt Cancer Center “ The Carevive system helps identify problems and issues that patients don’t tell me otherwise. This allows me to direct the encounter to patient needs and goals of care in a way I am not typically able. Dr. Randall Gibb - Gynecologic Oncologist, Billings, Montana “ This product goes far beyond what any of the other survivorship care planning programs on the market are able to provide and creates personalized, evidenced-based survivorship care plans that meet the latest requirements. For patients looking for a clear plan once treatment is complete, providers who want to provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive care, or providers just looking for an easy-to-use care planning system, Carevive Health has thought of it all and is an excellent resource for almost any practice. Carrie Tilley, MSN, ANP-BC - Cancer Survivorship Program at The George Washington Medical Faculty Associates

In order to be successful, any tools, resources, or processes must truly be integrated into existing models of care (e.g. clinic workflow, IT/EMR systems, revenue cycle, etc.). Otherwise it would be challenging to balance the quality of care relative to operational efficiency. Systems thinking is also critical to providing the framework for the analytics and clinical decision support necessary to improve patient-centered care. From there, it is a matter of organizational culture which is the rate-limiting step for meaningful change.10 Features of Carevive Systems Care Planning Platform2016Madelyn HerzfeldChief Executive OfficerCarevive SystemsCarrie Tompkins StrickerChief Clinical OfficerCarevive SystemsThe Oncology Care Model: 10 Ways Carevive Can Assist Cancer Centers Meet the RequirementsTreatment PlanningDelivering care plans to patients can be relatively easy, but how do we do that in a way that reduces our existing administrative/documentation burden  and  makes the information valuable for patients and their care teams."Administrative DashboardMatthew Kemmann, MBADirector, Strategic Planning & AnalyticsSeidman Cancer CenterThe Oncology Care Model: 10 Ways Carevive Can Assist Cancer Centers Meet the RequirementsSymptom Management Clinician Care Management DashboardsThe Oncology Care Model: 10 Ways Carevive Can Assist Cancer Centers Meet the RequirementsSurvivorshipThe Oncology Care Model: 10 Ways Carevive Can Assist Cancer Centers Meet the RequirementsAnalyticsThe Oncology Care Model: 10 Ways Carevive Can Assist Cancer Centers Meet the RequirementsQ & AAdministrative Dashboard (cont.)Carevive - Who We AreCare Planning Offering v2.0ContentEMR IntegrationWorkflowReporting/OutcomesProduct Demonstration Wrap Up and Next StepsCancer Center ROI-Survivorship Care Plan PlatformProduct: Survivorship Care PlansFull transcriptMore presentations by

“Our disposal costs have dropped which at least covers the cost of the compactors. Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”
Doug GehrigMcDonalds

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."
