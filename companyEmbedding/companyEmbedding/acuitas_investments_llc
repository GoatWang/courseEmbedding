Our Research

Exceptional research is a hallmark of Acuitas and is critical to our success.  Our research approach is fundamentally based, forward-looking, and supplemented by quantitative analysis.  
 
Focus - We focus on inefficient areas of the market where our managers will be able to exploit their skill to the fullest extent.
 
Robust idea generation - 
  Our idea generation is a key part of our research.  Early identification of great investment teams is particularly critical in inefficient markets, where products fill up quickly.
 
Deep, qualitative research - Onsite, face to face meetings with our managers aren't just important; we can't assess a manager without them. 
  Visiting managers' offices allows us to assess the depth of the team and improve our knowledge of the process. 
 
Supplemental quantitative analysis - 
Acuitas conducts robust analysis of portfolio decisions, characteristics, and return patterns.  That said, analysis of historical returns and holdings means little without a qualitative understanding of how the team generated the returns, why the team bought and sold the stocks that they did, and how those decisions fit within the process.

Investment Considerations:
There can be no guarantee that any strategy (risk management or otherwise) will be successful. All investing involves risk, including potential loss of principal.
Equity: Equity securities (stocks) are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments, including investments in high-grade fixed income securities. The net asset value per share of this Fund will fluctuate as the value of the securities in the portfolio changes.

Emerging Markets: Investments in emerging markets may be subject to additional economic, political, liquidity, and currency risks not associated with more developed countries.


Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus,
a copy of which can be obtained by calling (844) 805-5628. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.

The funds are offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the funds in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

Acuitas Investments Launches Long/Short Equity Strategy | Business Wire


























































Acuitas Investments Launches Long/Short Equity Strategy




Multi-manager firm builds on its microcap and small cap manager 
      research expertise to offer absolute return strategy






November 17, 2015 03:42 PM Eastern Standard Time



SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Acuitas Investments, LLC, an investment firm offering multi-manager 
      solutions in microcap and non-U.S small cap markets, has launched a 
      long/short equity strategy, the company announced today. The firm’s 
      investment philosophy centers on exploiting the return opportunities 
      available in the least efficient areas of the equity markets. Acuitas’s 
      long/short strategy seeks to deliver high absolute returns with low 
      correlation to equity markets, building on the firm’s expertise in 
      researching microcap and small cap managers.
    


      “Underfollowed areas of the equity markets such as microcap offer 
      opportunities for skilled investors to generate an information advantage 
      and deliver strong returns. This is the basis for Acuitas’s exclusive 
      focus on microcap and small cap markets globally. Implementing in a 
      long/short strategy enhances managers’ ability to exploit these return 
      opportunities through their ability to short,” said Chris Tessin, 
      Managing Partner at Acuitas.
    

      With equity volatility rising, but many investors expecting lower 
      returns from traditional investments, Acuitas believes market 
      participants are increasingly looking for unique sources of returns with 
      less volatility and low correlations to their existing portfolios. The 
      firm’s long/short product is a multi-manager strategy intended for plan 
      sponsors, endowments, wealth managers, and other institutional 
      investors. It will be offered in a commingled vehicle as well as in 
      separate accounts for larger investors.
    

      Acuitas’s research indicates that microcap and small cap stocks remain 
      an “undiscovered” asset class. According to the firm, of the estimated 
      5,200 publicly traded securities with market caps under $1.5 billion and 
      at least $500,000 average trading volume traded globally, over 60 
      percent have no sell-side analytical coverage. Acuitas believes this 
      gives skilled professional investors an opportunity to generate an 
      informational advantage that will result in strong returns.
    

      “In the inefficient areas we target it is critical to identify great 
      managers early in their life cycle when assets are low and their ability 
      to generate returns is the greatest,” said Dennis Jensen, the company’s 
      Director of Research. “Offering a return-focused long/short product with 
      limited net market exposure is a natural extension of the work we do for 
      our existing strategies, as we have been researching long/short managers 
      as part of our investment process since our founding in 2011.”
    

      To identify potential managers, Acuitas employs a fundamental research 
      process supplemented by quantitative analysis, while also taking into 
      account the unique qualities of the capacity-constrained asset classes. 
      The research includes a comprehensive analysis of the manager’s 
      investment process, philosophy, management team, and risk controls.
    

      “Our goal is to identify strong, alpha-focused managers before they turn 
      up on other institutional investors’ radar screens,” added Jensen. 
      “We’ve done this with our long-only products, and we utilize this same 
      approach in the long/short space.”
    

About Acuitas Investments LLC


      Based in Seattle, Washington, Acuitas Investments, LLC is a boutique 
      investment management firm providing access to capacity constrained, 
      inefficient areas of the equity markets through its multi-manager 
      platform.
    

      Acuitas is built on the pillars of exceptional research and a focus on 
      investment excellence in inefficient markets. The firm’s investment team 
      seeks to leverage what it believes are inefficiencies due to lack of 
      institutional attention in global small and microcap stocks to deliver 
      superior returns for institutional and high net worth clients. Acuitas 
      investment professionals are recognized as industry leaders in 
      investment manager research and multi-manager portfolio management.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
