			Mr. Grewal was appointed our President, Chief Executive Officer and a director in October 2009. Beginning in February 2009 until October 2009, he provided advisory services to S&W Seed Company, our predecessor general partnership (the "Partnership"). He became our full-time employee in October 2010. Since October 2009, he also has held the title of President and manager of our subsidiary, Seed Holding, LLC. Mr. Grewal served as the Chief Executive Officer, President and Farm Manager of Chowchilla, California-based Triangle T Partners, LLC ("TTP") from February 2009 through October 2010 and held the same positions with Triangle T Ranch, Inc. ("TTR"), the parent of TTP during the same period. At TTP and TTR, Mr. Grewal was responsible for all operations involved in farming a 13,000 acre diversified farming operation. From January 2006 until he joined TTR, Mr. Grewal was the principal of Grewal Consulting, in Lemoore, California, where he addressed water, land, drainage and fertilizing, herbicide and insecticide management issues. From February 2005 to December 2006, Mr. Grewal served as the Chief Operations Officer of SK Foods, in Lemoore, California, a leading grower and processor of vegetable products for remanufacturers, retail and foodservice markets ("SK Foods"). His responsibilities included being in charge of procuring raw products to ensure proper plant production, with the goal of maximizing cost benefits. Prior thereto, Mr. Grewal served in various executive management and operational roles for over 26 years with JG Boswell, Co., in Corcoran, California, a very large grower of agricultural crops. From 1999 to February 2005, Mr. Grewal served as the Vice President of Ranching and a member of the Board of Director of JG Boswell, Co. At both SK Foods and JG Boswell, he managed over 300 employees. Mr. Grewal is Chairman of the Plant Science Advisory Council of California State University and a member of the Leadership Committee of California State University, Fresno. Mr. Grewal earned a B.S. in Agronomy from California State University, Fresno, and an M.A. in Leadership from Saint Mary's College, Moraga, California. He is also a graduate of the California Agricultural Leadership Program (Class 28). The Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors believe that Mr. Grewal should be re-elected to the Board because his many years of experience working in various positions at major agricultural firms in the Central Valley, which, combined with his status as our Chief Executive Officer, contribute to both his invaluable insights and strategic thinking relevant to our business, as well provide numerous contacts in the farming community, all of which are of great benefit to our board and our company.
