Univar's Gary Pruitt to Retire as CEO


April 22, 2009

BELLEVUE, WA – Univar Chairman and CEO Gary Pruitt has decided to retire as Chief Executive Officer. He will remain with Univar as Chairman of the Board following the transition to a new CEO. 
 
Pruitt, a 30-year veteran of Univar, assumed the Chairman and CEO position after the company’s split-off from Royal Vopak in June 2002. His vision and leadership have solidified Univar’s position as a leading chemical distributor. As Chairman, Pruitt will continue to lead the strategic direction of the company. 
 
“Univar achieved record sales in 2008; the company is financially strong and successfully meeting the current economic challenges,” said Pruitt. “Personally and professionally, I feel the time is right for me to transition the CEO role to a new operating leader. As Chairman of the Board, I will continue to focus on global strategy and help Univar realize its fullest potential. This change will allow me to spend more time with my family and still stay involved with the company.” 
 
Pruitt and the Board of Directors have initiated the search process for his successor. The transition to a new CEO should be completed by the end of 2009.
