Another IPO ETF from Pointbreak On Its Way



May 25, 2016

FPX IPO 

Trades from
$1












 









Read MoreHide Full Article









The euphoria of initial public offering may have slowed in the U.S., but not the enthusiasm for filing new ETFs targeting the IPOs. This is evident from the recent filing of a U.S. IPO ETF by Pointbreak ETF Trust.
The U.S. IPO space saw no activity in the first month of January and since then exhibited very lesser actions than the same period of last year. However, the scenario turned a corner lately with activities in May peaking since October 2015. Also, things may shore up in the coming days once the U.S. market shrugs off volatility and marches ahead.
Below we highlight the newly filed Pointbreak IPO Index Fund (PBIQ) in detail:Inside PBIQ
The fund looks to track the FactSet US IPO index. FactSet Research Systems built the underlying index by following steps. First, it identifies the space of appropriate U.S. companies issuing common stocks through an IPO during the last three years or as a result of a corporate spin-off. Then it chooses the 60 largest companies and settles on the relative weighting of each company.
The likely constituents must have market capitalization of at least $250 million and serve liquidity requirements of a 30-day average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares or a 30-day average trading value of minimum $1 million. The expense ratio is yet to be disclosed.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?
This proposed product could be an interesting choice for investors seeking exposure to IPOs in the U.S. market. Though the U.S. IPO market slowed down lately, this was mainly due to the market upheaval which kept companies from indulging in IPOs, as per FactSet.
Moreover, such a calm period resulted in pent-up demand for IPOs or a pile of private companies seeking to go public, as per renaissancecapital.com. And once the market gains momentum, the IPO mood should charge up. Plus, an improving U.S. economy should help in driving the momentum (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here).Can it Succeed?
There are at present two products operating in the market on the U.S. IPO theme. These are First Trust US IPO ETF (FPX  -  Free Report)	 and Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO  -  Free Report)	. FPX provides exposure to the booming U.S. IPO market by tracking the IPOX-100 U.S. Index. The fund has accumulated $572.7 million in AUM since it debuted in 2006 (read: Another Blowout Quarter for Facebook: ETFs to Ride On).
On the other hand, IPO is a relatively new entrant in the space and has attracted $13.7 million in its asset base since its launch in late 2013. Both ETFs have an expense ratio of 0.60%. So, the proposed fund needs to charge competitively to attract investor attention (read: 5 Low-Cost ETFs Poised for Long-Term Wins).
Although underlying indices and the style of portfolio construction varies from one product to other, the IPO ETF space is gradually getting crowded. Investors should note that the fund IPO lags way behind FPX in terms of assets despite hailing from the same genre. So, PBIQ, if ever approved, should offer investors a better strategy and expense ratio to make a killing.

What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.
See how low-cost, commission-free ETFs are just the start

Another IPO ETF from Pointbreak On Its WayHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets open in 3 hrs 20 minsS&P Futures2,463.75-8.25 (-0.33%)Dow Futures21,707.00-36.00 (-0.17%)Nasdaq Futures5,855.50-54.00 (-0.91%)Another IPO ETF from Pointbreak On Its WayZacks Equity ResearchZacksMay 25, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareThe euphoria of initial public offering may have slowed in the U.S., but not the enthusiasm for filing new ETFs targeting the IPOs. This is evident from the recent filing of a U.S. IPO ETF by Pointbreak ETF Trust.The U.S. IPO space saw no activity in the first month of January and since then exhibited very lesser actions than the same period of last year. However, the scenario turned a corner lately with activities in May peaking since October 2015. Also, things may shore up in the coming days once the U.S. market shrugs off volatility and marches ahead.Below we highlight the newly filed Pointbreak IPO Index Fund (PBIQ) in detail:Inside PBIQThe fund looks to track the FactSet US IPO index. FactSet Research Systems built the underlying index by following steps. First, it identifies the space of appropriate U.S. companies issuing common stocks through an IPO during the last three years or as a result of a corporate spin-off. Then it chooses the 60 largest companies and settles on the relative weighting of each company.The likely constituents must have market capitalization of at least $250 million and serve liquidity requirements of a 30-day average daily trading volume of at least 200,000 shares or a 30-day average trading value of minimum $1 million. The expense ratio is yet to be disclosed.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?This proposed product could be an interesting choice for investors seeking exposure to IPOs in the U.S. market. Though the U.S. IPO market slowed down lately, this was mainly due to the market upheaval which kept companies from indulging in IPOs, as per FactSet.Moreover, such a calm period resulted in pent-up demand for IPOs or a pile of private companies seeking to go public, as per renaissancecapital.com. And once the market gains momentum, the IPO mood should charge up. Plus, an improving U.S. economy should help in driving the momentum (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here).Can it Succeed?There are at present two products operating in the market on the U.S. IPO theme. These are First Trust US IPO ETF (FPX) and Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO). FPX provides exposure to the booming U.S. IPO market by tracking the IPOX-100 U.S. Index. The fund has accumulated $572.7 million in AUM since it debuted in 2006 (read: Another Blowout Quarter for Facebook: ETFs to Ride On).On the other hand, IPO is a relatively new entrant in the space and has attracted $13.7 million in its asset base since its launch in late 2013. Both ETFs have an expense ratio of 0.60%. So, the proposed fund needs to charge competitively to attract investor attention (read: 5 Low-Cost ETFs Poised for Long-Term Wins).Although underlying indices and the style of portfolio construction varies from one product to other, the IPO ETF space is gradually getting crowded. Investors should note that the fund IPO lags way behind FPX in terms of assets despite hailing from the same genre. So, PBIQ, if ever approved, should offer investors a better strategy and expense ratio to make a killing.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

POINTBREAK US INTERNET INDEX FUND 
FUND SUMMARY   
Investment Objective  The
Pointbreak US Internet Index Fund (the Fund) seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Solactive US Internet Index. 
Fees and Expenses  This
table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund. The fees are expressed as a percentage of the Funds average daily net assets.

Other Expenses are estimated amounts for the current fiscal year, as the Fund has not commenced operations as of the date of this prospectus.   


(2) 

 Pointbreak Advisers LLC (the Adviser) has contractually agreed to waive or reduce its fees and to reimburse the Fund for its
expenses until December 31, 2017, so that the total annual operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and other expenses that are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, dividend,
interest and brokerage expenses, extraordinary expenses, if any, and payments, if any, under Rule 12b-1 Plan) of the Fund are limited to 0.XX% of average net assets. After such date, the expense limitation may
be renewed, terminated or revised by the Adviser. The Adviser is permitted to recoup from the Fund previously waived advisory fees or reimbursed expenses for three years from the fiscal year in which fees were waived or expenses reimbursed, as long
as such recoupment does not cause the Funds Operating expenses to exceed the expense cap that was

applicable during the period in which the fees were waived or expenses were reimbursed.  Example   This
Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds.  The Example
assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then sell all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Funds operating
expenses remain the same.  This Example does not include the brokerage commissions that investors may pay on their purchases and sales
of Fund shares. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your cost would be:

 The
3-Year example is calculated with the expectation that the Expense Limitation Agreement will not be in place after December 31, 2017.  Portfolio Turnover  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction
costs and may result in higher taxes when the Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Funds performance. Because the Fund is newly
organized, portfolio turnover information is not yet available.  Principal Investment Strategies 
The Fund will generally invest at least 90% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Solactive US Internet Index (the Underlying
Index). The Underlying Index is designed to track the performance of the largest and most liquid U.S.-listed companies engaged in Internet related business. The Underlying Index is designed to track the performance of small, medium and large
capitalization equities. Companies in the Underlying Index include Internet commerce companies who primarily provide goods or services through an open

Prospectus Xxxx XX, 2016


Table of Contents

network and Internet software and services companies involved in Internet related services, including Internet access providers, Internet search engines, web hosting, website design and
e-commerce.  The universe of companies in the Internet-related business is determined based on proprietary research and analysis
conducted by Solactive AG (Solactive or the Index Provider). Solactive uses a variety of publicly available resources for such analysis, including financial statements and other reports published by issuers to determine
whether a company is actively engaged in the Internet-related business.  Companies meeting the sector criteria are screened for
investibility, a minimum market capitalization of $200 million, liquidity (a minimum three-month average daily dollar trading volume of $2 million, a minimum free float of 20% and an operating company structure (as opposed to a pass-through
security).  The Underlying Index has a quarterly review the Thursday prior to the second Friday of each March, June, September and
December of each year. The Underlying Index is reconstituted and rebalanced using closing prices that day by Solactive. Component changes are made after the market close on the third Friday of March, June, September and December and become effective
at the market opening on the next trading day. Changes are announced on Solactives publicly available website at least five trading days prior to the effective date.  The Underlying Index is developed, owned, calculated and maintained by Solactive. The Underlying Index will generally consist of 35-50 component stocks and, as of [date], the Underlying Index
consisted of [XX] component stocks. Solactive will rank all companies within the universe by their total free-float market value. The free-float market value of a security differs from the total market value of the security in that the free-float
calculation does not include the value of shares held by a typically single controlling entity and that would not normally be available to trade in the marketplace.  Index Weighting. Exposure to each company is capped at 10% and such that the cumulative weight of all components with an individual weight of 4.5% or greater do not in the aggregate account
for more than 45% of the weight of the Underlying Index. Weightings are generally assigned only at the time of each rebalance of the Underlying Index, but

Table of Contents

may adjusted in between rebalance dates if a companys weight exceeds 10% of the Underlying Index. Weightings may be adjusted by Solactive to meet minimum liquidity criteria. 
Additional information about the Underlying Index, including the components and weightings, as well as the rules that govern inclusion and
weighting, is available at www.solactive.com by clicking on the Equity Indexing link at the top of the page, then clicking on the Custom Indices link on the left hand column, and then scrolling down the alphabetical
listings to the Solactive Internet Index link. The index rules can then be accessed under Documents at the bottom of the page by clicking the Guideline link. 
The Adviser generally follows a replication strategy, that is, it invests substantially all of its investments (and at least 90%) in
all of the securities comprising its Underlying Index in proportion to their weightings in the Underlying Index. If it is not possible for the Adviser to acquire component securities due to limited availability or regulatory restrictions, the
Adviser may use a representative sampling indexing strategy to seek to track the Underlying Index instead of a full replication indexing strategy. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy, meaning the Fund generally will invest in
a sample of securities in the index whose risk, return and other characteristics resemble the risk, return and other characteristics of the Underlying Index as a whole. The Fund may from time to time invest up to 10% of its total assets in
securities other than component securities of the Underlying Index, such as short-term U.S. Treasuries (treasuries with a maturity date of two years or less) and money market instruments to the extent that the Adviser believes such investments
should help the Funds overall portfolio track the Underlying Index.  Concentration Policy: The Fund will concentrate its
investments (i.e., invest 25% or more of the value of its total assets) in securities of issuers in any one industry or sector only to the extent that the Underlying Index reflects a concentration in that industry or sector. As of [XX, 2016], the
Underlying Index was concentrated in companies in the [technology sector].  Principal Risks 
As with all funds, a shareholder is subject to the risk that his or her investment could lose money. The principal risks affecting
shareholders investments in the Fund are set forth below. An investment in the Fund

is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any government agency.  Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the Creations and Redemptions section of the Funds prospectus (the Prospectus)) may
engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that act as Authorized Participants. To the extent that these institutions exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation
and/or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined below), Fund shares may trade at a discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts and/or
delisting.  Cash Transaction Risk. The Fund may effect creations and redemptions for cash, rather than for in-kind securities. If
the Fund effects redemptions for cash, rather than for in-kind securities, it may be required to sell portfolio securities in order to obtain the cash needed to distribute redemption proceeds, which may decrease the tax efficiency of the Fund
compared to ETFs that utilize an in-kind redemption process to a greater extent.  Consumer Discretionary Companies Risk. Consumer
discretionary companies are companies that provide non-essential goods and services, such as retailers, media companies and consumer services. These companies manufacture products and provide discretionary services directly to the consumer, and the
success of these companies is tied closely to the performance of the overall domestic and international economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. Success depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending.
Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, the success of, consumer discretionary products in the marketplace.  Equity Risk. Equity risk is the risk that the value of equity securities, including common stocks, may fall due to both changes in general economic conditions that impact the market as a
whole, as well as factors that directly relate to a specific company or its industry. Such general economic conditions include changes in interest rates, periods of market turbulence or instability, or general and prolonged periods of economic
decline and cyclical change. It is possible that a drop in the stock market may depress the price of most or all of the common stocks that the Fund holds. In addition, equity risk includes the risk that investor

Table of Contents

sentiment toward particular industries will become negative. The value of a companys common stock may fall solely because of factors, such as an increase in production costs that negatively
impact other companies in the same region, industry or sector of the market. A companys common stock also may decline significantly in price over a short period of time due to factors specific to that company, including decisions made by its
management or lower demand for the companys products or services. For example, an adverse event, such as an unfavorable earnings report or the failure to make anticipated dividend payments, may depress the value of common stock. 
Geographic Risk. A natural or other disaster could occur, causing an adverse impact on the Fund and the companies to which it has exposure.
 Growth and/or Value Stocks Risk. Investing in value stocks involves the risk that the market will not recognize a
securitys intrinsic value for a long time, or that a security thought to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced when purchased. Investing in growth stocks involves the risk that will not experience faster than average growth as
measured by revenues, earnings, or cash flow. While growth stocks are expected to offer the potential for higher returns, they also generally represent a greater risk when compared to value stocks. Growth stocks tend to do better than the overall
market when stock prices in general are rising, while underperforming the market as stock prices fall, taking into account that past performance does not guarantee future results. As a result, investing in growth funds may require a slightly higher
tolerance for risk, as well as a longer time horizon.  Index-Related Risk. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a
high degree of correlation to the Underlying Index and therefore achieve its investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Funds ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels
in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time, which may
have an adverse impact on the Fund.  Industry Concentration Risk. In followings its methodology, the Underlying Index from time
to time may be concentrated to a significant degree in securities of issuers located in a single industry or a sector. To the extent that the Underlying Index concentrates in the securities of   







 6

  
Prospectus Xxxx XX, 2016


Table of Contents

issuers in a particular industry or sector, the Fund will also concentrate its investments to approximately the same extent. By concentrating its investments in an industry or sector, the Fund
may face more risks than if it were diversified broadly over numerous industries or sectors. Such industry-based risks, any of which may adversely affect the companies in which the Fund invests, may include, but are not limited to, the following:
general economic conditions or cyclical market patterns that could negatively affect supply and demand in a particular industry; competition for resources, adverse labor relations, political or world events; obsolescence of technologies; and
increased competition or new product introductions that may affect the profitability or viability of companies in an industry. In addition, at times, such industry or sector may be out of favor and underperform other industries or the market as a
whole.  Internet Companies Risk. Internet companies are subject to rapid changes in technology, worldwide competition, rapid
obsolescence of products and services, loss of patent protections, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the considerable risk of owning small capitalization companies that have recently begun
operations.  Internet Software and Services Sector Risk. Competitive pressures, such as technological developments, fixed-rate
pricing and the ability to attract and retain skilled employees, can significantly affect the Internet software and services sectors. Changing domestic and international demand, research and development costs, availability and price components and
product obsolescence also can affect profitability of companies in this sector.  Issuer Risk. The Funds performance depends
on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline.  Large-Capitalization Companies Risk. The Fund may invest in large-cap segments of the U.S. stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic
conditions. During a period when large-cap U.S. stocks fall behind other types of investments  mid- or small-cap stocks, for instance  the Funds large-cap holdings could reduce performance.

Table of Contents
Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. Compared to large-capitalization companies,
mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities may be more volatile and less liquid.  Momentum and Correlation Risk. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Solactive US Internet Index, which is designed to track the performance of US listed companies
(i) that are of small, medium and large capitalization equities that represent companies in Internet-related businesses. Securities in the Underlying Index are weighted based on the total market value of their shares, so that securities with
higher total market values generally have a higher representation in the Index. Accordingly, although the Funds investment strategy of investing in [XX] different companies provides a certain level of diversification, because the
selection of companies is based in part on their market capitalization, which in turn reflects in part positive investment performance over a relatively short period, the Funds holdings may be weighted more heavily towards companies in
industries or economic sectors that have outperformed other industries or sectors over the same period. By way of example, high tech stocks, energy stocks, and financial stocks have at times outperformed the general market. There is no assurance
that any industries or economic sectors that may be overweighted in the Funds portfolio will continue to outperform the general market, and to the extent they underperform the general market, their concentration in the Funds portfolio
may adversely impact the Funds performance.   New Fund Risk. There can be no assurance that the Fund will
grow or maintain an economically viable size. If the Fund does not reach an economically viable size, the Board of Trustees of the Fund could decide to liquidate the Fund.  Non-Diversified Fund Risk. Because the Fund is non-diversified and can invest a greater portion of its assets in stocks of individual issuers than a diversified fund, changes in the market
value of a single investment could cause greater fluctuations in Share price than would occur in a diversified fund. This may increase the Funds volatility and cause the performance of a relatively small number of issuers to have a greater
impact on the Funds performance.  Operational Risk. The Fund is exposed to operational risk arising from a number of
factors, including but not limited to human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Funds service providers,   







 8

  
Prospectus Xxxx XX, 2016


Table of Contents

counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund seeks to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures.
However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate for those risks that they are intended to address. 
Passive Investment Risk. The Fund is not actively managed and therefore will not sell a security due to current or projected
underperformance of a security, industry or sector, unless that security is removed from the Underlying Index.  Reliance on Trading
Partners Risk. The Fund invests in an economy that is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the Funds investments. Through its portfolio companies trading
partners, the Fund is specifically exposed to U.S. Economic Risk.  Secondary Market Trading Risk. An investment in the Fund faces
numerous risks from its shares being traded in the secondary market, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption
process of the Fund. Any of these factors, among others, may lead to the Funds shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. 
Trading Issues. Although Fund shares are listed for trading on the BATS Global Markets, Inc. (BATS), there can be
no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund shares may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the BATS, make trading in shares inadvisable. There can be no
assurance that the requirements of the BATS necessary to maintain the listing of any Fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged or that the shares will trade with any volume, or at all. 
Fluctuation of NAV. The NAV of Fund shares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Funds
portfolio holdings. The market prices of shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the Funds NAV and supply and demand of shares on the BATS. It cannot be predicted whether Fund shares will trade below, at or above their
NAV.  Costs of Buying or Selling Shares. Investors buying or selling Fund shares in the secondary market will
pay brokerage

Table of Contents

commissions or other charges imposed by brokers as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to
buy or sell relatively small amounts of shares.  Smaller Companies Risk. Smaller companies in which the Fund may invest may be
more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies, and may underperform other segments of the market or the equity market as a whole.  Stock Market Risk. The values of common stocks in the Underlying Index could decline generally or could underperform other investments. 
Tax Risk. To qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to regulated investment companies, the Fund must satisfy certain
diversification requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In particular, the Fund generally may not acquire a security if, as a result of the acquisition, more than 50% or more of the value of the
Funds assets would be invested in (a) issuers in which the Fund has, in each case, invested more than 5% of the Funds assets and (b) issuers more than 10% of whose outstanding voting securities are owned by the Fund. When the
Underlying Index is concentrated in a relatively small number of securities, it may not be possible for the Fund to fully implement a replication strategy while satisfying these diversification requirements. The Funds efforts to satisfy the
diversification requirements may cause the Funds return to deviate from that of the Underlying Index, and the Funds efforts to replicate the Underlying Index may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy the diversification requirements.
If the Fund were to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company, it would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation, and distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by the Fund in computing its taxable income.
 Telecommunications Sector Risk. Companies in the telecommunications sector may be affected by industry competition, substantial
capital requirements, government regulation and obsolescence of telecommunications products and services due to technological advancement.  Tracking Error Risk. The Funds return may not match or achieve a high degree of correlation with the return of the Underlying Index.

Prospectus Xxxx XX, 2016


Table of Contents
U.S. Economic Risk. The United States is a significant trading partner of, or foreign investor
in foreign markets and such economies may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports, new trade regulations, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the United States may have a
material adverse effect on such foreign economy and, as a result, securities to which the Fund has exposure.  Valuation Risk. The
sales price that the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Funds valuation of the security and may differ from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or assets that trade in low volume or volatile
markets, or that are valued using a fair value methodology. In addition, the value of the securities or other assets in the Funds portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Funds shares.
 Performance Information  The Fund is new and therefore does not have performance history. Once available, the Funds performance information will be accessible on the Funds website at www.pointbreakETFs.com and
will provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Funds performance and by showing how the Funds returns compare with those of a broad measure of market performance. The Funds past
performance is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.  Investment Adviser 
PointBreak Advisers LLC (the Adviser) serves as the investment adviser to the Fund. 
Portfolio Manager  Jason
LaMacchia, Portfolio Manager, has been the Funds portfolio manager since its inception.  Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares
 Individual shares may only be purchased and sold on a national securities exchange through a broker-dealer. You can purchase and
sell individual shares of the Fund throughout the trading day like any publicly traded security. The Funds shares are listed on the BATS. The price of the Funds shares is based on market price, and because exchange-traded fund shares
trade at market prices rather than net asset value (NAV), shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less   






 
 

 11



Table of Contents

than NAV (discount). The Fund issues and redeems shares on a continuous basis, at NAV, only in blocks of 50,000 shares (Creation Units), principally in-kind for securities included in
the Underlying Index, and only Authorized Participants (typically, broker-dealers) may purchase or redeem Creation Units. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, the Funds shares are not redeemable securities. 
Tax Information  The distributions made by
the Fund are taxable, and will be taxed as ordinary income, qualified dividend income, or capital gains (or a combination), unless your investment is in an IRA or other tax-advantaged retirement account. However, subsequent withdrawals from such a
tax-advantaged account may be subject to federal income tax. You should consult your tax advisor about your specific tax situation. 
Financial Intermediary Compensation  If you
purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank) (an Intermediary), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay Intermediaries for certain activities related to the Fund, including
participation in activities that are designed to make Intermediaries more knowledgeable about exchange traded products, including the Fund, or for other activities, such as marketing, educational training or other initiatives related to the sale or
promotion of the Funds shares. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the Intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Any such arrangements do not result in increased Fund expenses.
Ask your salesperson or visit the Intermediarys website for more information.  ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT
OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES  The Fund, using an indexing investment approach, seeks to provide investment results that,
before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Underlying Index. A number of factors may affect the Funds ability to achieve a high correlation with the Underlying Index. There can be no guarantee that
the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation. The Adviser may sell securities that are represented in the Underlying Index or purchase securities not yet represented in the Underlying Index, in anticipation of their removal from or addition to
the Underlying Index. There may also be instances in which the Adviser may choose to overweight securities in the Underlying Index, thus causing the Adviser to purchase or sell securities not in the

Underlying Index which the Adviser believes are appropriate to substitute for certain securities in the Funds Underlying Index. The Fund will not take defensive positions. 
The Fund will generally invest at least 90% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Solactive US Internet Index (the
Underlying Index). The Underlying Index is designed to track the performance of the largest and most liquid U.S.-listed companies engaged in Internet related business. The Underlying Index is designed to track the performance of small,
medium and large capitalization equities. Companies in the Underlying Index include Internet commerce companies who primarily provide goods or services through an open network and internet software and services companies involved in Internet related
services, including Internet access providers, Internet search engines, web hosting, website design and e-commerce.  The universe of
companies in the Internet-related business is determined based on proprietary research and analysis conducted by Solactive AG (Solactive or the Index Provider). Solactive uses a variety of publicly available resources for
such analysis, including financial statements and other reports published by issuers to determine whether a company is actively engaged in the Internet-related business.  Companies meeting the sector criteria are screened for investibility, a minimum market capitalization of $200 million, liquidity (a minimum three-month average daily dollar trading volume of $2
million, a minimum free float of 20% and an operating company structure (as opposed to a pass-through security).  The Underlying Index
has a quarterly review the Thursday prior to the second Friday of each March, June, September and December of each year. The Underlying Index is reconstituted and rebalanced using closing prices that day by Solactive. Component changes are made
after the market close on the third Friday of March, June, September and December and become effective at the market opening on the next trading day. Changes are announced on Solactives publicly available website at least five trading days
prior to the effective date.  The Underlying Index is developed, owned, calculated and maintained by Solactive. The Underlying Index
will generally consist of 35-50 component stocks and, as of the date of this prospectus, the Underlying Index consisted of XX component stocks. Solactive will rank all

Table of Contents

companies within the universe by their total free-float market value. The free-float market value of a security differs from the total market value of the security in that the free-float
calculation does not include the value of shares held by a typically single controlling entity and that would not normally be available to trade in the marketplace.  Index Weighting.  Exposure to each company is capped at 10% and such that the
cumulative weight of all components with an individual weight of 4.5% or greater do not in the aggregate account for more than 45% of the weight of the Underlying Index. Weightings are generally assigned only at the time of each rebalance of the
Underlying Index, but may adjusted in between rebalance dates if a companys weight exceeds 10% of the Underlying Index. Weightings may be adjusted by Solactive to meet minimum liquidity criteria. 
The Fund will generally invest at least 90% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Underlying Index. The Fund may invest up to 10%
of its total assets in securities and other instruments other than the component securities in the Underlying Index to the extent that the Adviser believes such investments should help the Funds overall portfolio track the Underlying Index.
The Fund will also concentrate its investments (i.e., holds 25% or more of its net assets) in a particular industry or group of related industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. 
The Funds investment objective has been adopted as a non-fundamental investment policy and may be changed without shareholder approval upon
60 days written notice to shareholders.  Under the 1940 Act, the Fund must invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus any
borrowings for investment purposes, in securities suggested by its name (the 80% investment policy). The Fund considers the securities suggested by its name to be those securities that comprise its Underlying Index. Therefore, the Fund
will meet the 80% investment policy because the Fund intends to invest at least 90% of its total assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index in accordance with its principal investment strategies. The Funds 90% investment policy
constitutes a non-fundamental policy that the Board may change without shareholder approval, upon 60 days prior written notice to shareholders. The fundamental and non-fundamental policies of the Fund are set forth in the Funds Statement
of Additional Information (SAI).

The Underlying Index  The stocks that are components of the Underlying Index are selected using a proprietary methodology of the Index Provider. Companies eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index are those that
meet the requirements to be classified as XX Equities. The methodology for selecting XX Equities is described in the Principal Investment Strategies section above.  Solactive AG is the index provider for the Fund (the Index Provider). The Index Provider develops, calculates, and maintains its own proprietary indices and serves as the
calculation agent for third-party indices. The Adviser has entered into a license agreement with the Index Provider to use the Underlying Index. The Fund is entitled to use the Underlying Index pursuant to a sub-licensing arrangement with the
Adviser.  ADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION  The following section provides additional information regarding the principal risks identified under Principal Risks in the Funds summary. 
Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with
the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that act as Authorized Participants. To the extent that these institutions exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation and/or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no
other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may trade at a discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting.  Cash Transaction Risk. The Fund may effect creations and redemptions for cash, rather than for in-kind securities. ETFs generally are able to make in-kind redemptions and avoid being taxed on
gain on the distributed portfolio securities at the fund level. If the Fund effects redemptions for cash, rather than for in-kind securities, it may be required to sell portfolio securities in order to obtain the cash needed to distribute redemption
proceeds. The Fund may recognize a capital gain on these sales that might not have been incurred if the Fund had made a redemption in-kind, and this may decrease the tax efficiency of the Fund compared to ETFs that utilize an in-kind redemption
process to a greater extent.

Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk. The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers
is tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend
heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.
 Consumer Staples Sector Risk. Changes in the worldwide economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer
preferences, exploration and production spending may adversely affect companies, as well as natural and man-made disasters and political, social or labor unrest, in the consumer staples sector. Companies in this sector also are affected by changes
in government regulation, world events and economic conditions.  Custody Risk. Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the
process of clearing and settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets may make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments
or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of their local markets. In general, the less developed a
countrys securities markets are, the greater the likelihood of custody problems.  Equity Risk. Equity risk is the risk that
the value of equity securities, including common stocks, may fall due to both changes in general economic conditions that impact the market as a whole, as well as factors that directly relate to a specific company or its industry. Such general
economic conditions include changes in interest rates, periods of market turbulence or instability, or general and prolonged periods of economic decline and cyclical change. It is possible that a drop in the stock market may depress the price of
most or all of the common stocks that the Fund holds. In addition, equity risk includes the risk that investor sentiment toward particular industries will become negative. The value of a companys common stock may fall solely because of
factors, such as an increase in production costs, which negatively impact other companies in the same region, industry or sector of the market. A companys common stock also may decline significantly in price over a short period of time due to
factors specified to that company, including

Table of Contents

decisions made by its management or lower demand for the companys products or services. For example, an adverse event, such as an unfavorable earnings report or the failure to make
anticipated divided payments, may depress the value of common stock.  Geographic Risk. All regions have experienced natural
disasters such as earthquakes, droughts and floods and is economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event could cause a significant impact on the economy.  Healthcare Sector Risk. The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be affected by extensive government regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical
expenses, rising costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare
companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a companys patents may adversely affect that companys profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and
similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The
process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. 
Index-Related Risk. The Fund seeks to achieve a return which corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and
expenses, of the Underlying Index. There is no assurance that the Index Provider will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides
descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve, the Index Provider may not provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of data in respect of the Underlying Index, and may not
guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Providers methodology. The Advisers mandate as described in this prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index as it is provided. Errors in
respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time,

Table of Contents

particularly where the Underlying Index is less commonly used. Therefore, gains, losses or costs associated with Underlying Index errors will generally be borne by the Fund. For example, during a
period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Indexs other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact
the Fund. Any gains due to Index Provider errors will likely be kept by the Fund and any losses resulting from Index Provider errors will likely be borne by the Fund.  Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index
constituents. Where the Underlying Index of the Fund is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to correlate it to its Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing
will be borne directly by the Fund. Unscheduled rebalances to an Underlying Index may also expose the Fund to tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Funds returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and
additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider to the Underlying Index may increase the costs and market exposure risk of the Fund.  Industrial Sector Risk. The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand related to their specific products or services and
industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, world events, economic conditions and
exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector may
also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors.  Industry
Concentration Risk. In following its methodology, the Underlying Index from time to time may be concentrated to a significant degree in securities of issuers located in a single industry or a sector. To the extent that the Underlying Index
concentrates in the securities of issuers in a particular industry or sector, the Fund will also concentrate its investments to approximately the same extent. By concentrating its investments in an industry or sector, the Fund may face more risks
than   







 18

  
Prospectus Xxxx XX, 2016


Table of Contents

if it were diversified broadly over numerous industries or sectors. Such industry-based risks, any of which may adversely affect the companies in which the Fund invests, may include, but are not
limited to, the following: general economic conditions or cyclical market patterns that could negatively affect supply and demand in a particular industry; competition for resources, adverse labor relations, political or world events; obsolescence
of technologies; and increased competition or new product introductions that may affect the profitability or viability of companies in an industry. In addition, at times, such industry or sector may be out of favor and underperform other industries
or the market as a whole.  Information Technology Companies Risk. Information technology companies are generally subject to the
following risks: rapidly changing technologies; short product life cycles; fierce competition; aggressive pricing and reduced profit margins; the loss of patent, copyright and trademark protections; cyclical market patterns; evolving industry
standards; and frequent new product introductions. Information technology companies may be smaller and less experienced companies, with limited product lines, markets or financial resources and few experienced management or marketing personnel.
Information technology company stocks, especially those which are Internet related, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to their operating performance. 
Internet Companies Risk. Internet companies are subject to rapid changes in technology, worldwide competition, rapid obsolescence of
products and services, loss of patent protections, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the considerable risk of owning small capitalization companies that have recently begun operations.
 Internet Software and Services Sector Risk. Competitive pressures, such as technological developments, fixed-rate pricing and
the ability to attract and retain skilled employees, can significantly affect the Internet software and services sectors. Changing domestic and international demand, research and development costs, availability and price components and product
obsolescence also can affect profitability of companies in this sector.  Issuer Risk. The Funds performance depends on the
performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to

Table of Contents

decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or
shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures or other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. 
Large-Capitalization Companies Risk. The Fund may invest in the large-cap segment of the U.S. stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go in
and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. During a period when large-cap U.S. stocks fall behind other types of investments  bonds or small-cap stocks, for instance  the Funds performance also will lag those
investments.  Mid-Capitalization Company Risk. Investing in securities of mid-capitalization companies involves greater risk than
customarily is associated with investing in larger, more established companies. These companies securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies. These securities may have returns that vary, sometimes
significantly, from the overall securities market. Often mid-capitalization companies and the industries in which they focus are still evolving and, as a result, they may be more sensitive to changing market conditions. 
Momentum and Correlation Risk. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Solactive US Internet Index, which is designed to track
the performance of US-listed companies (i) that are of small, medium and large capitalization equities that represent companies in Internet-related businesses. Securities in the Underlying Index are weighted based on the total market value of
their shares, so that securities with higher total market values generally have a higher representation in the Index. Accordingly, although the Funds investment strategy of investing in [50] different companies provides a certain level of
diversification, because the selection of companies is based in part on their market capitalization, which in turn reflects in part positive investment performance over a relatively short period, the Funds holdings may be weighted more heavily
towards companies in industries or economic sectors that have outperformed other industries or sectors over the same period. By way of example, high tech stocks, energy stocks, and financial stocks have at times outperformed the general market.
There is no assurance that any industries or economic sectors that may be overweighted in the Funds portfolio will continue to outperform the general market, and to the extent they underperform the 
 







 20

  
Prospectus Xxxx XX, 2016


Table of Contents

general market, their concentration in the Funds portfolio may adversely impact the Funds performance.  New Fund Risk. There can be no assurance that the Fund will grow or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it may experience greater tracking error than it otherwise would
at higher asset levels, or it could ultimately liquidate. The Fund may be liquidated at any time without shareholder approval and at a time that is not favorable for all of its shareholders. Shareholders will be provided 60 days advance notice
of liquidation. Any liquidation will trigger income tax consequences to the Funds shareholders.  Non-Diversified Fund Risk.
Because the Fund is non-diversified and can invest a greater portion of its assets in securities of individual issuers than a diversified fund, changes in the market value of a single investment could cause greater fluctuations in Share price than
would occur in a diversified fund. This may increase the Funds volatility and cause the performance of a relatively small number of issuers to have a greater impact on the Funds performance. 
Operational Risk. The Fund is exposed to operational risk arising from a number of factors, including but not limited to human error,
processing and communication errors, errors of the Funds service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund seeks to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate for those risks that they are intended to address.  Passive Investment Risk: The Fund is not actively managed. Therefore, unless a specific security is removed from the Funds Underlying Index, the Fund generally will not sell a security
because the securitys issuer is in financial trouble. If a specific security is removed from the Underlying Index, the Fund may be forced to sell such security at an inopportune time or for a price other than the securitys current market
value. An investment in the Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any equity securities traded on an exchange, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and
perceived trends in security prices. It is anticipated that the value of Fund shares will decline, more or less, in correspondence with any decline in value of the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index may not contain the appropriate mix of
securities for any particular economic cycle, and the timing of movements from one

Table of Contents

type of security to another in seeking to replicate the Underlying Index could have a negative effect on the Fund. Unlike with an actively managed fund, the Adviser does not use techniques or
defensive strategies designed to lessen the effects of market volatility or to reduce the impact of periods of market decline. This means that, based on market and economic conditions, the Funds performance could be lower than other types of
mutual funds that may actively shift their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or to lessen the impact of a market decline.  Reliance on Trading Partners Risk. The Fund invests in an economy that is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the
Funds investments. Through its portfolio companies trading partners, the Fund is specifically exposed to U.S. Economic Risk. 
Secondary Market Trading Risk: An investment in the Fund faces numerous risks from its shares being traded in the secondary market,
including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the Fund. Any of these factors, among
others, may lead to the Funds shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.  Trading
Issues. Although Fund shares are listed for trading on the BATS, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund shares may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons
that, in the view of the BATS, make trading in shares inadvisable. In addition, trading in shares is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to BATS circuit breaker rules. There can be no assurance
that the requirements of the BATS necessary to maintain the listing of the Fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged or that the shares will trade with any volume, or at all. 
Fluctuation of NAV. The NAV of Fund shares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Funds
securities holdings. The market prices of shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the Funds NAV and supply and demand of shares on the BATS. It cannot be predicted whether Fund shares will trade below, at or above their
NAV. Price differences may be due, in large part, to the fact that supply and   







 22

Table of Contents

demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the securities of the Underlying Index
trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in time. The market prices of Fund shares may deviate significantly from the NAV of the shares during periods of market volatility. However, given that shares can be created and redeemed in
Creation Units (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAV), the Adviser believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of shares ought not to be
sustained. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it likely that Fund shares normally will trade close to the Funds NAV, disruptions to creations and redemptions may result in trading prices that differ significantly from
the Funds NAV. If an investor purchases Fund shares at a time when the market price is at a premium to the NAV of the shares or sells at a time when the market price is at a discount to the NAV of the shares, then the investor may sustain
losses.  Costs of Buying or Selling Shares. Investors buying or selling Fund shares in the secondary market
will pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by brokers as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts
of shares. In addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the difference between the price that an investor is willing to pay for shares (the bid price) and the price at which an investor is willing to sell shares
(the ask price). This difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as the spread or bid/ask spread. The bid/ask spread varies over time for shares based on trading volume and market liquidity, and is
generally lower if the Funds shares have more trading volume and market liquidity and higher if the Funds shares have little trading volume and market liquidity. Further, increased market volatility may cause increased bid/ask spreads.
Due to the costs of buying or selling shares, including bid/ask spreads, frequent trading of shares may significantly reduce investment results and an investment in shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small
investments.

Table of Contents
Smaller Companies Risk. The Fund may be composed primarily of, or have significant exposure to,
securities of smaller companies. As a result, the Fund may be subject to the risk that securities of smaller companies represented in the Fund may underperform securities of larger companies or the equity market as a whole. In addition, in
comparison to securities of companies with larger capitalizations, securities of smaller-capitalization companies may experience more price volatility, greater spreads between their bid and ask prices, significantly lower trading volumes, and
cyclical or static growth prospects. Smaller-capitalization companies often have limited product lines, markets or financial resources, and may therefore be more vulnerable to adverse developments than larger capitalization companies. These
securities may or may not pay dividends.  Stock Market Risk: An investment in the Fund involves risks similar to those of
investing in any fund of equity securities, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. The values of equity securities could decline
generally or could underperform other investments. In addition, securities may decline in value due to factors affecting a specific issuer, market or securities markets generally.  Tax Risk: To qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to regulated investment companies, the Fund must satisfy certain diversification requirements under the Code. In
particular, the Fund generally may not acquire a security if, as a result of the acquisition, more than 50% of the value of the Funds assets would be invested in (a) issuers in which the Fund has, in each case, invested more than 5% of
the Funds assets and (b) issuers more than 10% of whose outstanding voting securities are owned by the Fund. When the Underlying Index is concentrated in a relatively small number of securities, it may not be possible for the Fund to
fully implement a replication strategy or a representative sampling strategy while satisfying these diversification requirements. Therefore, the Funds return may deviate from that of its Underlying Index. Additionally, if the components of the
Underlying Index do not satisfy the diversification requirements, and the Funds efforts to replicate the Underlying Index may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy the diversification requirements. 
 







 24

  
Prospectus Xxxx XX, 2016


Table of Contents
If the Fund could not or did not cure such failure, it would cease to qualify for the special tax
treatment accorded regulated investment companies under federal income tax law, and the Fund would be liable for federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates on all of its income for that taxable year. This would likely materially reduce
the Funds investment return.  Technology Sector Risk. Technology companies, including information technology companies,
face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources and/or personnel. The products of technology
companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the technology sector are heavily
dependent on patent and other intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity
prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors.  Telecommunications Services Sector Risk. The
telecommunications services sector of an economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new
regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable.
Companies in the telecommunications sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in formulating new products and services using new technology. Technological
innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete.  Tracking Error Risk: Tracking
error refers to the risk that the Adviser may not be able to cause the Funds performance to match or correlate to that of the Underlying Index, either on a daily or aggregate basis. There are a number of factors that may contribute to the
Funds tracking error, such as Fund expenses, imperfect correlation between the Funds investments and those of its Underlying Index, rounding of share prices, changes to the composition of the Underlying Index, regulatory policies,
  






 
 

 25



Table of Contents

and high portfolio turnover rate. In addition, mathematical compounding may prevent the Fund from correlating with the monthly, quarterly, annual or other period performance of its Underlying
Index. Tracking error may cause the Funds performance to be less than expected.  U.S. Economic Risk. The United States is a
significant trading partner of, or foreign investor in foreign countries and such countries may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports, new trade regulations, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or
an economic slowdown in the United States may have a material adverse effect on foreign countries and, as a result, securities to which the Fund has exposure.  Valuation Risk. The sale price the Fund could receive for a security or other asset may differ from the Funds valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used
by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets, or that are valued using a fair value methodology. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its
shares, the value of the securities or other assets in the Funds portfolio may change on days when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Funds shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Funds NAV, the
value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. This conversion may result in a difference between the prices
used to calculate the Funds NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Funds performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. 
A Further Discussion of Other Risks  The Fund may also be subject to certain other non-principal risks associated with its investments and investment strategies.  Industrials Sector Risk. The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand related to their specific products or services
and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, world events, economic conditions and
exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and 
 







 26

  
Prospectus Xxxx XX, 2016


Table of Contents

product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the
industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this sector rely to a significant extent on government demand for their products and
services.  TAX PRODUCT STRUCTURE  Unlike interests in many conventional mutual funds, the Shares are traded throughout the day on a national securities exchange, whereas mutual fund interests are typically only bought and sold at
the closing NAV. The Shares have been designed to be created and redeemed principally in kind in Creation Units at each days next calculated NAV. These arrangements are designed to protect ongoing shareholders from adverse effects on the
Funds portfolio that could arise from frequent cash creation and redemption transactions. The Fund reserves the right to accept cash creation and redemption baskets, which would reduce tax efficiency. In a conventional mutual fund, redemptions
can have an adverse tax impact on shareholders because of the mutual funds need to sell portfolio securities to obtain cash to meet fund redemptions. These sales may generate taxable gains for the shareholders of the mutual fund, whereas the
in-kind redemption mechanism utilized by most ETFs, including the Fund, generally will not lead to a taxable event for the Fund or its shareholders.  PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS  Information about the
Funds daily portfolio holdings is available at www.pointbreakETFs.com. In addition, the Fund discloses its complete portfolio holdings as of the end of its fiscal year and its second fiscal quarter in its reports to shareholders. The Fund
files its complete portfolio holdings as of the end of its first and third fiscal quarters with the SEC on Form N-Q no later than 60 days after the relevant fiscal period. You can find the SEC filings on the SECs website, www.sec.gov. A
summarized description of the Funds policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the Funds portfolio holdings is available in the Funds Statement of Additional Information (SAI). Information on how to
obtain the SAI is on page 36.

BUYING AND SELLING THE FUND 
Fund shares are listed for secondary trading on the BATS. When you buy or sell the Funds shares on the secondary market, you will pay or
receive the market price. You may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the bid and the offered price in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction. The
shares will trade on the BATS at prices that may differ to varying degrees from the daily NAV of the shares. The BATS is generally open Monday through Friday and is closed weekends and the following holidays: New Years Day, Martin Luther King,
Jr. Day, Presidents Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.  NAV per
share for the Fund is computed by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (i.e., the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by its total number of shares outstanding. Expenses and fees, including management and distribution fees,
if any, are accrued daily and taken into account for purposes of determining NAV. NAV is determined each business day, normally as of the close of regular trading of the BATS (ordinarily 4:00 p.m., Eastern time). 
When determining NAV, the value of the Funds portfolio securities is based on market prices of the securities, which generally means a
valuation obtained from an exchange or other market (or based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of the value supplied by an exchange or other market) or a valuation obtained from an independent pricing service. If a securitys
market price is not readily available or does not otherwise accurately reflect the fair value of the security, the security will be valued by another method that the Board believes will better reflect fair value in accordance with the Trusts
valuation policies and procedures. Fair value pricing may be used in a variety of circumstances, including, but not limited to, situations when the value of a security in the Funds portfolio has been materially affected by events occurring
after the close of the market on which the security is principally traded but prior to the close of the BATS (such as in the case of a corporate action or other news that may materially affect the price of a security) or trading in a security has
been suspended or halted. Accordingly, the Funds NAV may reflect certain portfolio securities fair values rather than their market prices. 
   






 
 

 29



Table of Contents
Fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that a fair value determination
for a security will materially differ from the value that could be realized upon the sale of the security. In addition, fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Funds NAV and the prices used by
the Underlying Index. This may result in a difference between the Funds performance and the performance of the Underlying Index. 
Book Entry  Shares of the
Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (DTC) or its nominee is the record owner of all outstanding shares of the Fund. 
Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities
depository for all shares of the Fund. Participants include DTC, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a
beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of
shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any securities that you hold in book-entry or street name form. Your broker will provide you with account
statements, confirmations of your purchases and sales, and tax information.  Frequent Purchases and Redemptions of Fund Shares
 Unlike frequent trading of shares of a traditional open-end mutual funds (i.e., not exchange-traded) shares, frequent trading
of shares of the Fund on the secondary market does not disrupt portfolio management, increase the Funds trading costs, lead to realization of capitalization gains, or otherwise harm the Funds shareholders because these trades do not
involve the Fund directly. Certain institutional investors are authorized to purchase and redeem the Funds shares directly with the Fund. To the extent these trades are effected in-kind (i.e., for securities, and not for cash), they do not
cause any of the harmful effects noted above that may result from frequent cash trades. Moreover, the Fund imposes transaction fees on in-kind purchases and redemptions of Creation Units to cover the custodial and other costs incurred by the Fund in
effecting in-kind trades. These fees increase if an investor substitutes cash in part or in whole for Creation Units, reflecting the fact

that the Funds trading costs increase in those circumstances. For these reasons, the Board has determined that it is not necessary to adopt policies and procedures to detect and deter
frequent trading and market-timing in shares of the Fund.  DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES
 Fund Distributions  The Fund intends to pay out dividends, if any, quarterly and distribute any net realized capital gains to its shareholders at least annually. 
Dividend Reinvestment Service 
Brokers may make available to their customers who own the Funds shares the DTC book-entry dividend reinvestment service. If this service is
available and used, dividend distributions of both income and capital gains will automatically be reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund. Without this service, investors would receive their distributions in cash. In order to achieve the
maximum total return on their investments, investors are encouraged to use the dividend reinvestment service. To determine whether the dividend reinvestment service is available and whether there is a commission or other charge for using this
service, consult your broker. Brokers may require the Funds shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically
reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.  Tax Information 
The following is a summary of some important tax issues that affect the Fund and its shareholders. The summary is based on current tax laws, which
may be changed by legislative, judicial or administrative action. You should not consider this summary to be a detailed explanation of the tax treatment of the Fund, or the tax consequences of an investment in the Fund. The summary is very general,
and does not address investors subject to special rules, such as investors who hold shares through an IRA, 401(k) or other tax-deferred account. More information about taxes is located in the SAI. You are urged to consult your tax adviser regarding
specific questions as to federal, state and local income taxes.  Tax Status of the Fund 
The Fund is treated as a separate entity for federal tax purposes, and intends to qualify for the special tax treatment afforded to regulated
investment companies under the Code. As long as the Fund qualifies as

Table of Contents

a regulated investment company, it pays no federal income tax on the earnings it distributes to shareholders.  Tax Status of Distributions   


 

 
 The Fund will, for each year, distribute substantially all of its net investment income and net capital gains. 
 


 

 
 The Funds distributions from income will generally be taxed to you as ordinary income or qualified dividend income. For noncorporate
shareholders, dividends reported by the Fund as qualified dividend income are generally eligible for reduced tax rates.   


 

 
 Corporate shareholders may be entitled to a dividends-received deduction for the portion of dividends they receive that are attributable to
dividends received by the Fund from U.S. corporations, subject to certain limitations. The Funds strategies may limit its ability to distribute dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction for corporate shareholders.
  


 

 
 Any distributions of net capital gain (the excess of the Funds net long-term capital gains over its net short-term capital losses) that you
receive from the Fund are taxable as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares. Long-term capital gains are currently taxed to noncorporate shareholders at reduced maximum rates. 
 


 

 
 Dividends and distributions are generally taxable to you whether you receive them in cash or in additional shares through a brokers
dividend reinvestment service. If you receive dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares through a brokers dividend reinvestment service, you will be required to pay applicable federal, state or local taxes on the reinvested
dividends but you will not receive a corresponding cash distribution with which to pay any applicable tax.   


 

 
 The Fund may be able to pass through to you foreign tax credits for certain taxes paid by the Fund, provided the Fund meets certain requirements.
  


 

 
 Distributions paid in January but declared by the Fund in October, November or December of the previous year may be taxable to you in the
previous year.


 
 The Fund will inform you of the amount of your ordinary income dividends, qualified dividend income, foreign tax credits and net capital gain
distributions received from the Fund shortly after the close of each calendar year.  Taxes on Exchange-Listed Share
Sales. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of shares will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year and as short-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held
for one year or less, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of amounts treated as distributions of long-term capital gains to the shareholder with
respect to such shares.  Medicare Tax. U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly)
are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on their net investment income, including interest, dividends, and capital gains (including capital gains realized on the sale or exchange of shares). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a
portion of the undistributed net investment income of certain shareholders that are estates and trusts.  Non-U.S. Investors. If
you are not a citizen or permanent resident of the United States, the Funds ordinary income dividends will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies or unless such income is effectively connected
with a U.S. trade or business. This 30% withholding tax generally will not apply to distributions of net capital gain.  Distributions
paid after June 30, 2014 and sale proceeds and certain capital gain dividends paid after December 31, 2018 to a shareholder that is a foreign financial institution as defined in Section 1471 of the Code and that does not
meet the requirements imposed on foreign financial institutions by Section 1471 will generally be subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate. Distributions paid after June 30, 2014 and sale proceeds and certain capital gain dividends paid
after December 31, 2018 to a non-U.S. shareholder that is not a foreign financial institution will generally be subject to such withholding tax if the shareholder fails to make certain required certifications. A non-U.S. shareholder may be
exempt from the withholding described in this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the U.S. and a foreign government, provided that the shareholder and the applicable foreign government comply with the terms of such
agreement.

Backup Withholding. The Fund or your broker will be required in certain cases to withhold (as
backup withholding) on amounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, (2) is subject to backup withholding by the Internal Revenue Service for failure
to properly report payments of interest or dividends, (3) has failed to certify that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding, or (4) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien).
The backup withholding rate is currently 28%. Backup withholding will not, however, be applied to payments that have been subject to the 30% withholding tax applicable to shareholders who are neither citizens nor residents of the United States.
 DISTRIBUTION  The Distributor, ALPS Distributors, Inc., is a broker-dealer registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Distributor distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis
and does not maintain a secondary market in Fund shares. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributors principal address is 1290 Broadway Street,
Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203.  The Board has adopted a Distribution and Service Plan (the Plan) pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under
the 1940 Act. In accordance with the Plan, the Fund is authorized to pay an amount up to 0.25% of its average daily net assets each year for certain distribution-related activities and shareholder services. No Rule 12b-1 fees are currently paid
by the Fund, and there are no plans to impose these fees. However, in the event Rule 12b-1 fees are charged in the future, because the fees are paid out of the Funds assets, over time these fees will increase the cost of your
investment and may cost you more than certain other types of sales charges.  PREMIUM/DISCOUNT INFORMATION
 The Fund is new and therefore does not have any information regarding how often shares of the Fund traded on the Exchange at a
price above (i.e., at a premium) or below (i.e., at a discount) the NAV of the Fund. When available, such information will be available in the Funds Annual Report to shareholders and at www.pointbreakETFs.com. Any such information represents
past performance and cannot be used to predict future results.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRUST 
The Trust is an open-end management investment company currently consisting of multiple investment series, of which the Pointbreak US Internet Index Fund (the
Fund) is one such series. The Trust was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on June 18, 2015. The Trust is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the 1940 Act), and the offering of the Funds shares (Shares) is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Pointbreak Advisers LLC (the Adviser) serves
as investment adviser to the Fund. The Fund is a non-diversified management investment company under the 1940 Act. The investment objective of the Fund is to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the
price and yield performance of the Solactive Internet Index (the Index or Underlying Index).  The Fund offers and issues Shares at
their net asset value only in aggregations of a specified number of Shares (each, a Creation Unit). Only Authorized Participants may purchase or redeem shares directly from the Fund. An Authorized Participant is either
(i) a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or (ii) a Depository Trust Company (DTC) participant and, in each
case, must have executed a Participant Agreement with the Distributor. Most retail investors will not qualify as Authorized Participants or have the resources to buy and sell whole Creation Units. Therefore, they will be unable to purchase or redeem
the shares directly from the Fund. Rather, most retail investors will purchase shares in the secondary market with the assistance of a broker and will be subject to customary brokerage commissions or fees. The Fund generally offers and issues Shares
in exchange for a basket of securities included in its Index (Deposit Securities) together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (Cash Component). The Trust reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of a
cash in lieu amount (Deposit Cash) to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security. The Shares are listed on the BATS Global Markets, Inc. (BATS or the Exchange) and trade on the
Exchange at market prices. These prices may differ from the Shares net asset values. The Shares are also redeemable only in Creation Unit aggregations, and generally in exchange for portfolio securities and a specified cash payment. A Creation
Unit of the Fund consists of at least 50,000 Shares (Creation Unit Aggregations).  Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of Deposit
Securities subject to various conditions including a requirement to maintain on deposit with the Trust an amount in cash at least equal to a specified percentage of the market value of the missing Deposit Securities as set forth in the Participant
Agreement (as defined below). The Trust may impose a transaction fee for each creation or redemption (Creation or Redemption Transaction Fee). In all cases, such fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of the SEC
applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.  ADDITIONAL INDEX INFORMATION 
A brief description of the Solactive Internet Index on which the Fund is based and the equity markets in which the Fund invests is provided below. Additional
information about the Index, including the components and weightings, as well as the rules that govern inclusion and weighting is available at www.solactive.com by clicking on the Equity Indexing link at the top of the page, then
clicking on the Custom Indices link on the left hand column, and then scrolling down the alphabetical listings to the Solactive Internet Index link. The index rules can then be accessed under Documents at the
bottom of the page by clicking the Guideline link.  Component Selection Criteria. The Fund will generally invest at least 90% of
its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Solactive US Internet Index (the Underlying Index). The Underlying Index is designed to track the performance of the largest and most liquid U.S.-listed companies engaged in Internet
related business. The Underlying Index is designed to track the performance of small, medium and large capitalization equities. Companies in the Underlying Index include Internet commerce companies who primarily provide goods or services through an
open network and Internet software and services companies involved in Internet related services, including Internet access providers, Internet search engines, web hosting, website design and e-commerce. 
The universe of companies in the Internet-related business is determined based on proprietary research and analysis conducted by Solactive AG
(Solactive or the Index Provider). Solactive uses a variety of publicly available resources for such analysis, including financial statements and other reports published by issuers to determine whether a company is actively
engaged in the Infrastructure Providers or Service Providers sector. 
  1 


Table of Contents
Companies meeting the sector criteria are screened for investibility (e.g., must not be listed on an exchange in
a country which employs certain restrictions on foreign capital investment), a minimum market capitalization of $200 million, liquidity (a minimum three-month average daily dollar trading volume of $2 million, a minimum free float of 20% and an
operating company structure (as opposed to a pass-through security).  The Underlying Index has a quarterly review the Thursday prior to the second Friday
of each March, June, September and December of each year. The Underlying Index is reconstituted and rebalanced using closing prices that day by Solactive. Component changes are made after the market close on the third Friday of March, June,
September and December become effective at the market opening on the next trading day. Changes are announced on Solactives publicly available website at least five trading days prior to the effective date. 
The Underlying Index is developed, owned, calculated and maintained by Solactive. The Underlying Index will generally consist of 35  50
component stocks and, as of the date of this prospectus, the Underlying Index consisted of XX component stocks. Solactive will rank all companies within the universe by their total free-float market value. The free-float market value of a security
differs from the total market value of the security in that the free-float calculation does not include the value of shares held by a typically single controlling entity and that would not normally be available to trade in the marketplace. 
Index Weighting. Exposure to each company is capped at 10% and such that the cumulative weight of all components with an individual weight of 4.5% or
greater do not in the aggregate account for more than 45% of the weight of the Underlying Index. Weightings are generally assigned only at the time of each rebalance of the Underlying Index, but may adjusted in between rebalance dates if a
companys weight exceeds 10% of the Underlying Index. Weightings may be adjusted by Solactive to meet minimum liquidity criteria.  Additional
information about the Underlying Index, including the components and weightings, as well as the rules that govern inclusion and weighting, is available at www.solactive.com by clicking on the Equity Indexing link at the top of the
page, then clicking on the Custom Indices link on the left hand column, and then scrolling down the alphabetical listings to the Solactive US Internet Index link. The index rules can then be accessed under
Documents at the bottom of the page by clicking the Guideline link.  The Fund generally follows a replication
strategy, that is, it invests substantially all of its investments (and at least 90%) in all of the securities comprising its Underlying Index in proportion to their weightings in the Underlying Index. However, the Fund may from time to time
invest up to 10% of its total assets in securities other than component securities of the Underlying Index, such as short-term U.S. Treasuries and money market instruments to the extent that the Adviser believes such investments should help the
Funds overall portfolio track the Underlying Index.  Index Maintenance. Index maintenance occurs throughout the year and includes monitoring
and implementing the adjustments for company additions and deletions, stock splits, corporate restructurings and other corporate actions. Corporate actions are generally implemented after the close of trading on the day prior to the ex-date of such
corporate actions. To the extent reasonably practicable, such changes will be announced at least two days prior to their implementation.  Index
Availability. The Index is calculated and disseminated throughout each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading.  Index Provider.
Solactive AG is the index provider for the Fund (the Index Provider). The Index Provider is not affiliated with the Trust, the Adviser, the Distributor, or the Administrator. The Adviser has entered into a license agreement with
the Index Provider to use the Index. The Fund is entitled to use the Index pursuant to a sub-licensing arrangement with the Adviser.  The Index Provider
develops, calculates, and maintains its own proprietary indices and serves as the calculation agent for third-party indices.  Changes to the Index
Methodology. The Index is governed by a published, rules-based methodology. Changes to the methodology may be made only by the Index Provider and will be publicly disclosed at www.solactive.com/en/ prior to implementation. Sixty
(60) days notice will be given prior to the implementation of any such change. 
  2 


Table of Contents
Daily Index Calculation. The Index Provider, using the rules-based methodology, will calculate, maintain
and disseminate the Index on a daily basis. In addition, the Index Provider has established policies and procedures designed to prevent non-public information about pending changes to the Index from being used or disseminated in an improper manner.
 CONTINUOUS OFFERING 
The method by which Creation Unit Aggregations of shares are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation
Unit Aggregations of shares are issued and sold by the Fund on an ongoing basis, at any point a distribution, as such term is used in the Securities Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on
their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions
of the Securities Act.  For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Unit Aggregations after
placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares, and sells such shares directly to customers, or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of
secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the
particular case, and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter. Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not
underwriters but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3)
of the Securities Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Fund are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153
under the Securities Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Exchange is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at the
Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is only available with respect to transactions on an exchange.  
PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS  Policy on Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings 
The Board of Trustees of the Trust (the Board) has adopted a policy on disclosure of portfolio holdings, which it believes is in the best interest
of the Funds shareholders. The policy is designed to: (i) protect the confidentiality of the Funds non-public portfolio holdings information, (ii) prevent the selective disclosure of such information, and (iii) ensure
compliance by the Adviser and the Fund with the federal securities laws, including the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder and general principles of fiduciary duty. The Funds portfolio holdings, or information derived from the
Funds portfolio holdings, may, in the Advisers discretion, be made available to third parties if (i) such disclosure has been included in the Funds public filings with the SEC or is disclosed on the Funds publicly
accessible Website, (ii) such disclosure is determined by the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) to be in the best interests of Fund shareholders and consistent with applicable law; (iii) such disclosure information is made equally
available to anyone requesting it; and (iv) the Adviser determines that the disclosure does not present the risk of such information being used to trade against the Fund. 
Each business day portfolio holdings information will be provided to the Funds transfer agent or other agent for dissemination through the facilities of
the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) and/or other fee based subscription services to NSCC members and/or subscribers to those other fee based subscription services, including Authorized Participants (defined below), and to
entities that publish and/or analyze such information in connection with the process of purchasing or redeeming Creation Units or trading shares of the Fund in the secondary market. Information with respect to the Funds portfolio holdings is
also disseminated daily on the Funds website.  The Distributor may also make available portfolio holdings information to other institutional market
participants and entities that provide information services. This information typically reflects the Funds anticipated holdings on the following 
  3 


Table of Contents

business day. Authorized Participants are generally large institutional investors that have been authorized by the Distributor to purchase and redeem large blocks of shares (known as
Creation Units) pursuant to legal requirements, including the exemptive order granted by the SEC, through which the Fund offers and redeems shares. Other than portfolio holdings information made available in connection with the creation/redemption
process, as discussed above, portfolio holdings information that is not filed with the SEC or posted on the publicly available website may be provided to third parties only in limited circumstances, as described above. 
Disclosure to providers of auditing, custody, proxy voting and other similar services for the Fund, as well as rating and ranking organizations, will
generally be permitted; however, information may be disclosed to other third parties (including, without limitation, individuals, institutional investors, and Authorized Participants that sell shares of the Fund) only upon approval by the CCO. The
recipients who may receive non-public portfolio holdings information are as follows: the Adviser and its affiliates, the Funds independent registered public accounting firm, the Funds distributor, administrator and custodian, the
Funds legal counsel, the Funds financial printer and the Funds proxy voting service. These entities are obligated to keep such information confidential. Third-party providers of custodial or accounting services to the Fund may
release non-public portfolio holdings information of the Fund only with the permission of the CCO.  Portfolio holdings will be disclosed through required
filings with the SEC. The Fund files its portfolio holdings with the SEC for each fiscal quarter on Form N-CSR (with respect to each annual period and semiannual period) and Form N-Q (with respect to the first and third quarters of the Funds
fiscal year). Shareholders may obtain the Funds Forms N-CSR and N-Q filings on the SECs website at www.sec.gov. In addition, the Funds Forms N-CSR and N-Q filings may be reviewed and copied at the SECs public reference room
in Washington, DC. You may call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for information about the SECs website or the operation of the public reference room. Under the policy, the Board is to receive information, on a quarterly basis, regarding any
other disclosures of non-public portfolio holdings information that were permitted during the preceding quarter. As part of the annual review of the Funds compliance policies and procedures, the CCO will report to the Board regarding the
operation and effectiveness of this policy, including as to any changes to the policies and procedures that have been made or recommendations for future changes. The Board is responsible for approving or ratifying any amendment to this policy. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND RELATED RISKS 
The Funds investment objective and principal investment strategies are described in the Prospectus. The following information supplements, and should be
read in conjunction with, the Prospectus. For a description of certain permitted investments, see Description of Permitted Investments in this SAI. 
NON-DIVERSIFICATION  The Fund is classified as a
non-diversified investment company under the 1940 Act. A non-diversified classification means that the Fund is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single
issuer. This means that the Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a small number of issuers than a diversified fund. The securities of a particular issuer or a small number of issuers may constitute
a greater portion of the Underlying Index and, therefore, the securities may constitute a greater portion of the Funds portfolio. This may have an adverse effect on the Funds performance or subject the Funds Shares to greater price
volatility than more diversified investment companies. Moreover, in pursuing its objective, the Fund may hold the securities of a single issuer in an amount exceeding 10% of the market value of the outstanding securities of the issuer, subject to
restrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In particular, as the Funds size grows and its assets increase, it will be more likely to hold more than 10% of the securities of a single issuer if
the issuer has a relatively small public float as compared to other components in its Underlying Index.  BORROWING 
Although the Fund does not intend to borrow money, the Fund may do so to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the Fund may borrow up to
one-third (1/3) of its net assets. The Fund will borrow money only for short-term or emergency purposes. Such borrowing is not for investment purposes and will be repaid by the borrowing Fund promptly. Borrowing will tend to exaggerate the
effect on net asset value (NAV) of any increase or decrease in the market value of the Funds portfolio. Money borrowed will be subject to interest costs that may or may not be recovered by earnings on the securities purchased. The
Fund also may be required to maintain minimum average balances in connection with a borrowing or to pay a commitment or other fee to maintain a line of credit; either of these requirements would increase the cost of borrowing over the stated
interest rate.

DESCRIPTION OF PERMITTED INVESTMENTS 
The following are descriptions of the permitted investments and investment practices and the associated risk factors. The Fund will only invest in any of the
following instruments or engage in any of the following investment practices if such investment or activity is consistent with the Funds investment objective and permitted by the Funds stated investment policies. 
EQUITY SECURITIES  Equity securities represent ownership
interests in a company and include common stocks, preferred stocks, warrants to acquire common stock, and securities convertible into common stock. Investments in equity securities in general are subject to market risks that may cause their prices
to fluctuate over time. Fluctuations in the value of equity securities in which the Fund invests will cause the net asset value of the Fund to fluctuate. 
Types of Equity Securities:  Common Stocks  Common stocks
represent units of ownership in a company. Common stocks usually carry voting rights and earn dividends. Unlike preferred stocks, which are described below, dividends on common stocks are not fixed but are declared at the discretion of the
companys board of directors.  Preferred Stocks  Preferred stocks are also units of ownership in a company. Preferred stocks normally have
preference over common stock in the payment of dividends and the liquidation of the company. However, in all other respects, preferred stocks are subordinated to the liabilities of the issuer. Unlike common stocks, preferred stocks are generally not
entitled to vote on corporate matters. Types of preferred stocks include adjustable-rate preferred stock, fixed dividend preferred stock, perpetual preferred stock, and sinking fund preferred stock. 
Generally, the market values of preferred stock with a fixed dividend rate and no conversion element varies inversely with interest rates and perceived credit
risk.  Convertible Securities  Convertible securities are securities that may be exchanged for, converted into, or exercised to acquire a
predetermined number of shares of the issuers common stock at the Funds option during a specified time period (such as convertible preferred stocks, convertible debentures and warrants). A convertible security is generally a fixed income
security that is senior to common stock in an issuers capital structure, but is usually subordinated to similar non-convertible securities. In exchange for the conversion feature, many corporations will pay a lower rate of interest on
convertible securities than debt securities of the same corporation. In general, the market value of a convertible security is at least the higher of its investment value (i.e., its value as a fixed income security) or its
conversion value (i.e., its value upon conversion into its underlying common stock).  Convertible securities are subject to the same
risks as similar securities without the convertible feature. The price of a convertible security is more volatile during times of steady interest rates than other types of debt securities. The price of a convertible security tends to increase as the
market value of the underlying stock rises, whereas it tends to decrease as the market value of the underlying common stock declines.  Rights and Warrants
 A right is a privilege granted to existing shareholders of a corporation to subscribe to shares of a new issue of common stock before it is issued. Rights normally have a short life of usually two to four weeks, are freely transferable and
entitle the holder to buy the new common stock at a lower price than the public offering price. Warrants are securities that are usually issued together with a debt security or preferred stock and that give the holder the right to buy proportionate
amount of common stock at a specified price. Warrants are freely transferable and are traded on major exchanges. Unlike rights, warrants normally have a life that is measured in years and entitles the holder to buy common stock of a company at a
price that is usually higher than the market price at the time the warrant is issued. Corporations often issue warrants to make the accompanying debt security more attractive.

Table of Contents
An investment in warrants and rights may entail greater risks than certain other types of investments. Generally,
rights and warrants do not carry the right to receive dividends or exercise voting rights with respect to the underlying securities, and they do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuer. In addition, their value does not necessarily
change with the value of the underlying securities, and they cease to have value if they are not exercised on or before their expiration date. Investing in rights and warrants increases the potential profit or loss to be realized from the investment
as compared with investing the same amount in the underlying securities.  Risks of Investing in Equity Securities: 
General Risks of Investing in Stocks  While investing in stocks allows investors to participate in the benefits of owning a company, such
investors must accept the risks of ownership. Unlike bondholders, who have preference to a companys earnings and cash flow, preferred stockholders, followed by common stockholders in order of priority, are entitled only to the residual amount
after a company meets its other obligations. For this reason, the value of a companys stock will usually react more strongly to actual or perceived changes in the companys financial condition or prospects than its debt obligations.
Stockholders of a company that fares poorly can lose money.  Stock markets tend to move in cycles with short or extended periods of rising and falling
stock prices. The value of a companys stock may fall because of:   


 

 
Factors that directly relate to that company, such as decisions made by its management or lower demand for the companys products or services; 
 


 

 
Factors affecting an entire industry, such as increases in production costs; and   


 

 
Changes in general financial market conditions that are relatively unrelated to the company or its industry, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or inflation rates. 
Because preferred stock is generally junior to debt securities and other obligations of the issuer, deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer will
cause greater changes in the value of a preferred stock than in a more senior debt security with similar stated yield characteristics.  Small- and
Medium-Sized Companies  Investors in small- and medium-sized companies typically take on greater risk and price volatility than they would by investing in larger, more established companies. This increased risk may be due to the greater
business risks of their small or medium size, limited markets and financial resources, narrow product lines and frequent lack of management depth. The securities of small- and medium-sized companies are often traded in the over-the-counter market
and might not be traded in volumes typical of securities traded on a national securities exchange. Thus, the securities of small and medium capitalization companies are likely to be less liquid, and subject to more abrupt or erratic market
movements, than securities of larger, more established companies.  When-Issued Securities  A when-issued security is one whose terms are
available and for which a market exists, but which have not been issued. When the Fund engages in when-issued transactions, it relies on the other party to consummate the sale. If the other party fails to complete the sale, the Fund may miss the
opportunity to obtain the security at a favorable price or yield.  When purchasing a security on a when-issued basis, the Fund assumes the rights and
risks of ownership of the security, including the risk of price and yield changes. At the time of settlement, the market value of the security may be more or less than the purchase price. The yield available in the market when the delivery takes
place also may be higher than those obtained in the transaction itself. Because the Fund does not pay for the security until the delivery date, these risks are in addition to the risks associated with its other investments. 
Decisions to enter into when-issued transactions will be considered on a case-by-case basis when necessary to maintain continuity in a
companys index membership. The Fund will segregate cash or liquid securities equal in value to commitments for the when-issued transactions. The Fund will segregate additional liquid assets daily so that the value of such assets is equal to
the amount of the commitments.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITS) 
A REIT is a corporation or business trust (that would otherwise be taxed as a corporation) that meets the definitional requirements of the Code. The Code
permits a qualifying REIT to deduct from taxable income the dividends paid, thereby effectively eliminating corporate level federal income tax and making the REIT a pass-through vehicle for federal income tax purposes. To meet the definitional
requirements of the Code, a REIT must, among other things: invest substantially all of its assets in interests in real estate (including mortgages and other REITs), cash and government securities; derive most of its income from rents from real
property or interest on loans secured by mortgages on real property; and distribute annually 90% or more of its otherwise taxable income to shareholders. 
REITs are sometimes informally characterized as Equity REITs and Mortgage REITs. An Equity REIT invests primarily in the fee ownership or leasehold ownership
of land and buildings; a Mortgage REIT invests primarily in mortgages on real property, which may secure construction, development or long-term loans. 
REITs may be affected by changes in underlying real estate values, which may have an exaggerated effect to the extent that REITs in which the Fund invests may
concentrate investments in particular geographic regions or property types. Additionally, rising interest rates may cause investors in REITs to demand a higher annual yield from future distributions, which may in turn decrease market prices for
equity securities issued by REITs. Rising interest rates also generally increase the costs of obtaining financing, which could cause the value of the Funds investments to decline. During periods of declining interest rates, certain Mortgage
REITs may hold mortgages that the mortgagors elect to prepay, which prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by such Mortgage REITs. In addition, Mortgage REITs may be affected by the ability of borrowers to repay when due the debt
extended by the REIT and Equity REITs may be affected by the ability of tenants to pay rent.  Certain REITs have relatively small market capitalization,
which may tend to increase the volatility of the market price of securities issued by such REITs. Furthermore, REITs are dependent upon specialized management skills, have limited diversification and are, therefore, subject to risks inherent in
operating and financing a limited number of projects. By investing in REITs indirectly through the Fund, a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the Fund, but also, indirectly, similar expenses of the
REITs. REITs depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders.  In addition to these risks, Equity REITs may
be affected by changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts, while Mortgage REITs may be affected by the quality of any credit extended. Further, Equity and Mortgage REITs are dependent upon management skills and generally may
not be diversified. Equity and Mortgage REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and self-liquidation. In addition, Equity and Mortgage REITs could possibly fail to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Code
or to maintain their exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act. The above factors may also adversely affect a borrowers or a lessees ability to meet its obligations to the REIT. In the event of default by a borrower or lessee, the
REIT may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its investments. 
U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES  The Fund may invest in U.S.
government securities. Securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities include U.S. Treasury securities, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury and which differ only in their
interest rates, maturities, and times of issuance. U.S. Treasury bills have initial maturities of one-year or less; U.S. Treasury notes have initial maturities of one to ten years; and U.S. Treasury bonds generally have initial maturities of greater
than ten years. Certain U.S. government securities are issued or guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. government including, but not limited to, obligations of U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities such as Fannie Mae, the
Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), the Small Business Administration, the Federal Farm Credit Administration, the Federal Home Loan Banks, Banks for Cooperatives (including the Central Bank for Cooperatives), the
Federal Land Banks, the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Commodity Credit Corporation, the Federal Financing Bank, the National Credit Union Administration and the
Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac).

Table of Contents
Some obligations issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities, including, for example,
Ginnie Mae pass-through certificates, are supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. Other obligations issued by or guaranteed by federal agencies, such as those securities issued by Fannie Mae, are supported by the discretionary
authority of the U.S. government to purchase certain obligations of the federal agency, while other obligations issued by or guaranteed by federal agencies, such as those of the Federal Home Loan Banks, are supported by the right of the issuer to
borrow from the U.S. Treasury, while the U.S. government provides financial support to such U.S. government-sponsored federal agencies, no assurance can be given that the U.S. government will always do so, since the U.S. government is not so
obligated by law. U.S. Treasury notes and bonds typically pay coupon interest semi-annually and repay the principal at maturity.  On September 7,
2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a federal takeover of Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, placing the two federal instrumentalities in conservatorship. Under the takeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed to acquire $1 billion of senior preferred stock of
each instrumentality and obtained warrants for the purchase of common stock of each instrumentality (the Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement or Agreement). Under the Agreement, the U.S. Treasury pledged to provide up to
$200 billion per instrumentality as needed, including the contribution of cash capital to the instrumentalities in the event their liabilities exceed their assets. This was intended to ensure that the instrumentalities maintain a positive net
worth and meet their financial obligations, preventing mandatory triggering of receivership. On December 24, 2009, the U.S. Treasury announced that it was amending the Agreement to allow the $200 billion cap on the U.S. Treasurys
funding commitment to increase as necessary to accommodate any cumulative reduction in net worth until 2012. For the period during which these Agreements were in effect, the investments of holders, including the Fund, of mortgage-backed securities
and other obligations issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are protected. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remained in conservatorship as of December 31, 2014.   


 

 
U.S. Treasury Obligations. U.S. Treasury obligations consist of bills, notes and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury and separately traded interest and principal component parts of such obligations that are
transferable through the federal book-entry system known as Separately Traded Registered Interest and Principal Securities (STRIPS) and Treasury Receipts (TRs). 
 


 

 
Receipts. Interests in separately traded interest and principal component parts of U.S. government obligations that are issued by banks or brokerage firms and are created by depositing U.S. government obligations
into a special account at a custodian bank. The custodian holds the interest and principal payments for the benefit of the registered owners of the certificates or receipts. The custodian arranges for the issuance of the certificates or receipts
evidencing ownership and maintains the register. TRs and STRIPS are interests in accounts sponsored by the U.S. Treasury. Receipts are sold as zero coupon securities. 
 


 

 
U.S. Government Zero Coupon Securities. STRIPS and receipts are sold as zero coupon securities, that is, fixed income securities that have been stripped of their unmatured interest coupons. Zero coupon securities
are sold at a (usually substantial) discount and redeemed at face value at their maturity date without interim cash payments of interest or principal. The amount of this discount is accreted over the life of the security, and the accretion
constitutes the income earned on the security for both accounting and tax purposes. Because of these features, the market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that have similar maturity
but that pay interest periodically. Zero coupon securities are likely to respond to a greater degree to interest rate changes than are non-zero coupon securities with similar maturity and credit qualities.

U.S. Government Agencies. Some obligations issued or guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government are supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury, others are supported by the right of the issuer
to borrow from the U.S. Treasury, while still others are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality. Guarantees of principal by agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. government may be a guarantee of payment at the maturity of the
obligation so that in the event of a default prior to maturity there might not be a market and thus no means of realizing on the obligation prior to maturity. Guarantees as to the timely payment of principal and interest do not extend to the value
or yield of these securities nor to the value of the Funds Shares.  OTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS 
The Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including short-term Treasuries and money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for
other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds; (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or
instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs), bankers acceptances, fixed time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and foreign banks (including foreign
branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated at the date of purchase Prime-1 by Moodys or A-1 by S&P, or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by the Adviser;
(v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (e.g., bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that satisfy the rating requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940
Act; and (vi) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of foreign banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of the Adviser, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks which may be purchased by the Fund. Any of these
instruments may be purchased on a current or a forward-settled basis. Money market instruments also include shares of money market funds. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at
stated interest rates. Bankers acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions. 
INVESTMENT COMPANIES  The Fund may invest in the
securities of other investment companies, including money market funds, subject to applicable limitations under Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Section 12(d)(1), the Fund may invest in the securities of another investment
company (the acquired company) provided that the Fund, immediately after such purchase or acquisition, does not own in the aggregate: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company;
(ii) securities issued by the acquired company having an aggregate value in excess of 5% of the value of the total assets of the Fund; or (iii) securities issued by the acquired company and all other investment companies (other than
Treasury stock of the Fund) having an aggregate value in excess of 10% of the value of the total assets of the Fund. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, the Fund may invest its assets in securities of investment companies that are money
market funds in excess of the limits discussed above.  If the Fund invests in and, thus, is a shareholder of, another investment company, the Funds
shareholders will indirectly bear the Funds proportionate share of the fees and expenses paid by such other investment company, including advisory fees, in addition to both the management fees payable directly by the Fund to the Funds
own investment adviser and the other expenses that the Fund bears directly in connection with the Funds own operations.  LENDING PORTFOLIO
SECURITIES  The Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain creditworthy borrowers. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount
at least equal to the current value of the securities loaned. The Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. The Fund receives the value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned
securities. Distributions received on loaned securities in lieu of dividend payments (i.e., substitute payments) would not be considered qualified dividend income. 
  9 


Table of Contents
With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower will be entitled to receive a fee based on
the amount of cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, the Fund is compensated by a fee
paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of the lending fund or through one or more joint accounts or money
market funds, which may include those managed by the Adviser.  The Fund may pay a portion of the interest or fees earned from securities lending to a
borrower as described above, and to one or more securities lending agents approved by the Board who administer the lending program for the Fund in accordance with guidelines approved by the Board. In such capacity, the lending agent causes the
delivery of loaned securities from the Fund to borrowers, arranges for the return of loaned securities to the Fund at the termination of a loan, requests deposit of collateral, monitors the daily value of the loaned securities and collateral,
requests that borrowers add to the collateral when required by the loan agreements, and provides recordkeeping and accounting services necessary for the operation of the program. 
Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement
and accounting process), gap risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. In the event
a borrower does not return the Funds securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated
plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities.  Short Sales. The Fund may engage in short sales that are either
uncovered or against the box. A short sale is against the box if at all times during which the short position is open, the Fund owns at least an equal amount of the securities or securities convertible into, or
exchangeable without further consideration for, securities of the same issue as the securities that are sold short. A short sale against the box is a taxable transaction to the Fund with respect to the securities that are sold short. 
Uncovered short sales are transactions under which the Fund sells a security it does not own. To complete such a transaction, the Fund must borrow the
security to make delivery to the buyer. The Fund then is obligated to replace the security borrowed by purchasing the security at the market price at the time of the replacement. The price at such time may be more or less than the price at which the
security was sold by the Fund. Until the security is replaced, the Fund is required to pay the lender amounts equal to any dividends or interest that accrue during the period of the loan. To borrow the security, the Fund also may be required to pay
a premium, which would increase the cost of the security sold. The proceeds of the short sale will be retained by the broker, to the extent necessary to meet margin requirements, until the short position is closed out. 
Until the Fund closes its short position or replaces the borrowed security, the Fund may: (a) segregate cash or liquid securities at such a level that
(i) the amount segregated plus the amount deposited with the broker as collateral will equal the current value of the security sold short; and (ii) the amount segregated plus the amount deposited with the broker as collateral will not be
less than the market value of the security at the time the security was sold short; or (b) 
otherwise cover the Funds short position.  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS 
A discussion of the risks associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in
conjunction with, the Prospectus.  GENERAL  Investment in
the Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Funds portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of securities generally
and other factors.  An investment in the Fund should also be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in securities, including
the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition 
  10 


Table of Contents

of the securities markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio securities and thus in the value of Shares). Securities are susceptible to general
market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors including expectations regarding
government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises. 
Holders of common stocks incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders, as owners of the issuer, have
generally inferior rights to receive payments from the issuer in comparison with the rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, the issuer. Further, unlike debt securities which typically have a stated
principal amount payable at maturity (whose value, however, will be subject to market fluctuations prior thereto), or preferred stocks which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption
provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Common stock values are subject to market fluctuations as long as the common stock remains outstanding. 
TAX RISKS  As with any investment, you should consider how your
investment in Shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in the Prospectus and this SAI is provided as general information. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in Shares of the Fund.
 Unless your investment in Shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an individual retirement account, you
need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Shares.  INVESTMENT
RESTRICTIONS  The Trust has adopted the following investment restrictions as fundamental policies with respect to the Fund. These restrictions cannot
be changed with respect to the Fund without the approval of the holders of a majority of the Funds outstanding voting securities. For the purposes of the 1940 Act, a majority of outstanding shares means the vote of the lesser of:
(1) 67% or more of the voting securities of the Fund present at the meeting if the holders of more than 50% of the Funds outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy; or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding
voting securities of the Fund. Except with the approval of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, the Fund may not:   


1.
Concentrate its investments in an industry or group of industries (i.e., hold 25% or more of its net assets in the stocks of a particular industry or group of industries), except that the Fund will concentrate to
approximately the same extent that its Underlying Index concentrates in the stocks of such particular industry or group of industries. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities),
and securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.   


2.
Borrow money or issue senior securities (as defined under the 1940 Act), except to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations thereunder or any exemption therefrom, as such statute, rules or
regulations may be amended or interpreted from time to time.   


3.
Lend any security or make any other loan except to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act the rules and regulations thereunder or any exemption therefrom, as such statute, rules or regulations may be amended or
interpreted from time to time.   


4.
Purchase or sell commodities or real estate, except to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations thereunder or any exemption therefrom, as such statute, rules or regulations may be amended or
interpreted from time to time. 
  11 


Table of Contents


5.
Underwrite securities issued by other persons, except to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, the rules and regulations thereunder or any exemption therefrom, as such statute, rules or regulations may be amended or
interpreted from time to time.  In addition to the investment restrictions adopted as fundamental policies as set forth above, the Fund
observes the following restrictions, which may be changed without a shareholder vote.   


1.
The Fund will not invest in illiquid assets in excess of 15% of its net assets. An illiquid asset is any asset which may not be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven days at approximately
the value at which the Fund has valued the investment.   


2.
Under normal circumstances, the Fund will not invest less than 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in the component securities of its Underlying Index. Prior to any change
in this 80% investment policy, the Fund will provide shareholders with 60 days written notice.  If a percentage limitation is adhered
to at the time of investment or contract, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from any change in value or total or net assets will not result in a violation of such restriction, except that the percentage limitations with respect to
the borrowing of money and illiquid securities will be observed continuously.  The following descriptions of certain provisions of the 1940 Act may assist
investors in understanding the above policies and restrictions:  Concentration. The SEC has defined concentration as investing 25% or more of an
investment companys net assets in an industry or group of industries, with certain exceptions. Securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), and securities of state or municipal governments and their
political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by members of any industry; however, investments in municipal bonds issued by for the purpose of financing specific projects are considered to be investments in the industry of the underlying
projects for purposes of this concentration policy.  Borrowing. The 1940 Act presently allows a fund to borrow from any bank (including pledging,
mortgaging or hypothecating assets) in an amount up to 33 1/3% of its total assets (not including temporary borrowings not in excess of 5% of its total assets). 
Senior Securities. Senior securities may include any obligation or instrument issued by a fund evidencing indebtedness. The 1940 Act generally
prohibits funds from issuing senior securities, although it does not treat certain transactions as senior securities, such as certain borrowings, short sales, reverse repurchase agreements, firm commitment agreements and standby commitments, with
appropriate earmarking or segregation of assets to cover such obligation.  Lending. Under the 1940 Act, a fund may only make loans if expressly
permitted by its investment policies. The Funds current investment policy on lending is as follows: the Fund may not make loans if, as a result, more than 33 1/3% of its total assets would be lent to other parties, except that the Fund may:
(i) purchase or hold debt instruments in accordance with its investment objective and policies; (ii) enter into repurchase agreements; and (iii) engage in securities lending as described in its SAI. 
Underwriting. Under the 1940 Act, underwriting securities involves a fund purchasing securities directly from an issuer for the purpose of selling
(distributing) them or participating in any such activity either directly or indirectly.  Real Estate. The 1940 Act does not directly restrict
an investment companys ability to invest in real estate, but does require that every investment company have a fundamental investment policy governing such investments. The Fund will not purchase or sell real estate, except that the Fund may
purchase marketable securities issued by companies which own or invest in real estate (including REITs). 
  12 


Table of Contents
Commodities. The Fund will not purchase or sell physical commodities or commodities contracts, except that
the Fund may purchase marketable securities issued by companies which own or invest in commodities or commodities contracts. 
EXCHANGE LISTING AND TRADING 
A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an investment in the Fund is contained in the summary section of the Funds
Prospectus under the PURCHASE AND SALE OF FUND SHARES and in the statutory Prospectus under BUYING AND SELLING THE FUND. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, such sections of the
Prospectus.  The Shares of the Fund are approved for listing and trading on the Exchange, subject to notice of issuance. The Shares trade on the Exchange
at prices that may differ to some degree from their net asset value. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of Shares of the Fund will continue to be met. 
The Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the Shares of the Fund from listing if: (1) following the initial twelve-month period beginning upon the
commencement of trading of the Fund, there are fewer than 50 beneficial holders of the Shares for 30 or more consecutive trading days; (2) the value of its Underlying Index or portfolio of securities on which the Fund is based is no longer
calculated or available; (3) the indicative optimized portfolio value (IOPV) of the Fund is no longer calculated or available; or (4) such other event shall occur or condition exists that, in the opinion of the
Exchange, makes further dealings on the Exchange inadvisable. In addition, the Exchange will remove the Shares from listing and trading upon termination of the Trust or the Fund. 
The Exchange will disseminate, every fifteen seconds during the regular trading day, an IOPV relating to the Fund. The IOPV calculations are estimates of the
value of the Funds net asset value per Share using market data converted into U.S. dollars at the current currency rates. The IOPV price is based on quotes and closing prices from the securities local market and may not reflect events that
occur subsequent to the local markets close. Premiums and discounts between the IOPV and the market price may occur. This should not be viewed as a real-time update of the net asset value per Share of the Fund, which is calculated
only once a day. Neither the Fund or the Adviser, nor any of their affiliates is involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of such IOPVs and make no warranty as to their accuracy. 
The Trust reserves the right to adjust the Share price of the Fund in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be
accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Fund.  As in the case of other publicly
traded securities, brokers commissions on transactions will be based on negotiated commission rates at customary levels.  The base and trading
currencies of the Fund is the U.S. dollar. The base currency is the currency in which the Funds net asset value per Share is calculated and the trading currency is the currency in which Shares of the Fund are listed and traded on the Exchange.
 MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST 
The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled Fund Management. 
TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS OF THE TRUST  Board
Responsibilities. The management and affairs of the Trust and the Fund described in this SAI are overseen by the Trustees. The Board elects the officers of the Trust who are responsible for administering the day-to-day operations of the Trust
and the Fund. The Board has approved contracts, as described below, under which certain companies provide essential services to the Trust.  Like most
registered investment companies, the day-to-day business of the Trust, including the management of risk, is performed by third party service providers, such as the Adviser, the Distributor and the Administrator. The Trustees are 
  13 


Table of Contents

responsible for overseeing the Trusts service providers and, thus, have oversight responsibility with respect to risk management performed by those service providers. Risk management seeks
to identify and address risks, i.e., events or circumstances that could have material adverse effects on the business, operations, shareholder services, investment performance or reputation of the Fund. The Fund and its service providers
employ a variety of processes, procedures and controls to identify various of those possible events or circumstances, to lessen the probability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur. Each
service provider is responsible for one or more discrete aspects of the Trusts business (e.g., the Adviser is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Funds portfolio investments) and, consequently, for managing the risks
associated with that business. The Board has emphasized to the Funds service providers the importance of maintaining vigorous risk management.  The
Trustees role in risk oversight begins before the inception of the Fund, at which time certain of the Funds service providers present the Board with information concerning the investment objectives, strategies and risks of the Fund as
well as proposed investment limitations for the Fund. Additionally, the Funds Adviser provides the Board with an overview of, among other things, its investment philosophy, brokerage practices and compliance infrastructure. Thereafter, the
Board continues its oversight function as various personnel, including the Trusts Chief Compliance Officer, as well as personnel of the Adviser and other service providers such as the Funds independent accountants, make periodic reports
to the Audit Committee or to the Board with respect to various aspects of risk management. The Board and the Audit Committee oversee efforts by management and service providers to manage risks to which the Fund may be exposed. 
The Board is responsible for overseeing the nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Fund by the Adviser and receives information about
those services at its regular meetings. In addition, on an annual basis, in connection with its consideration of whether to renew the Advisory Agreements with the Adviser, the Board meets with the Adviser to review such services. Among other things,
the Board regularly considers the Advisers adherence to the Funds investment restrictions and compliance with various Fund policies and procedures and with applicable securities regulations. The Board also reviews information about the
Funds performance and the Funds investments, including, for example, portfolio holdings schedules.  The Trusts Chief Compliance Officer
reports regularly to the Board to review and discuss compliance issues and Fund and Adviser risk assessments. At least annually, the Trusts Chief Compliance Officer provides the Board with a report reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of
the Trusts policies and procedures and those of its service providers, including the Adviser. The report addresses the operation of the policies and procedures of the Trust and each service provider since the date of the last report; any
material changes to the policies and procedures since the date of the last report; any recommendations for material changes to the policies and procedures; and any material compliance matters since the date of the last report. 
The Board receives reports from the Funds service providers regarding operational risks and risks related to the valuation and liquidity of portfolio
securities. The Board has also established a Valuation Committee that is responsible for implementing the Trusts Valuation Procedures and providing reports to the Board concerning investments for which market quotations are not readily
available. Annually, the independent registered public accounting firm reviews with the Audit Committee its audit of the Funds financial statements, focusing on major areas of risk encountered by the Fund and noting any significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Funds internal controls. Additionally, in connection with its oversight function, the Board oversees Fund managements implementation of disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in its periodic reports with the SEC are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the required time periods. The Board also oversees the Trusts internal controls over
financial reporting, which comprise policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Trusts financial reporting and the preparation of the Trusts financial statements. 
From their review of these reports and discussions with the Adviser, the Chief Compliance Officer, the independent registered public accounting firm and other
service providers, the Board and the Audit Committee learn in detail about the material risks of the Fund, thereby facilitating a dialogue about how management and service providers identify and mitigate those risks. 
The Board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified and/or quantified, that it may not be practical or cost-effective to
eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Funds goals, and that the processes, procedures and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited
in their effectiveness. Moreover, reports received by the Trustees as to risk management matters 
  14 


Table of Contents

are typically summaries of the relevant information. Most of the Funds investment management and business affairs are carried out by or through the Funds Adviser and other service
providers each of which has an independent interest in risk management but whose policies and the methods by which one or more risk management functions are carried out may differ from the Funds and each others in the setting of
priorities, the resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Boards ability to monitor and manage risk, as a practical matter, is subject to limitations. 
Members of the Board. There are three members of the Board, two of whom are not interested persons of the Trust, as that term is defined in the
1940 Act (Independent Trustees). John Hyland, an interested person of the Trust, serves as Chairman of the Board. The Trust does not have a lead Independent Trustee. The Board is comprised of 66% Independent Trustees. There is an Audit
Committee of the Board that is chaired by an Independent Trustee and comprised solely of Independent Trustees. The Audit Committee chair presides at the Committee meetings, participates in formulating agendas for Committee meetings, and coordinates
with management to serve as a liaison between the Independent Trustees and management on matters within the scope of responsibilities of the Committee as set forth in its Board-approved charter. Because of the ease of communication arising from the
relatively small size of the Board and the small number of Independent Trustees, the Board has determined not to designate a lead Independent Trustee at this time. 
The Trust has determined its leadership structure is appropriate given the specific characteristics and circumstances of the Trust. The Trust made this
determination in consideration of, among other things, the fact that the Independent Trustees constitute 66% of the Board, the number of Independent Trustees that constitute the Board, the amount of assets under management in the Trust, and the
number of funds overseen by the Board. The Board also believes that its leadership structure facilitates the orderly and efficient flow of information to the Independent Trustees from Fund management. 
The Board of Trustees has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and Valuation Committee. The Audit Committee and Nominating
Committee are chaired by an Independent Trustee and composed of the Independent Trustees.  Set forth below are the names, birth years, positions with the
Trust, length of term of office, the number of portfolios in the Fund Complex (defined below) overseen by each Independent Trustee, and the principal occupations and other directorships held during at least the last five years of each of the persons
currently serving as a Trustee of the Trust, as well as information about each officer. The business address of each Trustee and officer P.O. Box 347312, San Francisco, CA 94134. The Fund Complex includes all open- and closed-end funds (including
all of their portfolios) advised by the Adviser and any funds that have an investment adviser that is an affiliated person of the Adviser. As of the date of this SAI, the Fund Complex consists of four Funds.

 Individual Trustee Qualifications. The Trust has concluded that each of the Trustees should serve on the Board because
of their ability to review and understand information about the Fund provided to them by management, to identify and request other information they may deem relevant to the performance of their duties, to question management and other service
providers regarding material factors bearing on the management and administration of the Fund, and to exercise their business judgment in a manner that serves the best interests of the Funds shareholders. The Trust has concluded that each of
the Trustees should serve as a Trustee based on their own experience, qualifications, attributes and skills as described below.  In concluding that
Mr. John Hyland should serve as a Trustee, the Board considered his experience as chief investment officer of multiple investment advisory firms as well as his knowledge of and experience in the financial services industry. 
In concluding that Mr. Gavin Graham should serve as a Trustee, the Board considered his career as a financial services industry executive. 
In concluding that Mr. Robert Thompson should serve as a Trustee, the Board considered his broad career as a portfolio manager and financial industry
executive.  BOARD COMMITTEES  The Board has
established the following standing committees:  Audit Committee. The Board has a standing Audit Committee that is composed of 100% of the
Independent Trustees of the Trust. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board. The principal responsibilities of the Audit Committee include: recommending which firm to engage as the Funds independent registered
public accounting firm and whether to terminate this relationship; reviewing the independent registered public accounting firms compensation, the proposed scope and terms of its engagement, and the firms independence; pre-approving audit
and non-audit services provided by the Funds independent registered public accounting firm to the Trust and certain other affiliated entities; serving as a channel of communication between the independent registered public accounting firm and
the Trustees; reviewing the results of each external audit, including any qualifications in the independent registered public accounting firms opinion, any related management letter, managements responses to recommendations made by the
independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the audit, reports submitted to the Committee by the internal auditing department of the

reviewing, in consultation with the Funds independent registered public accounting firm, major changes regarding auditing and accounting principles and practices to be followed when preparing the Funds financial statements; and other
audit related matters. All of the Independent Trustees currently serve as members of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also acts as the Trusts qualified legal compliance committee. 
Nominating Committee. The Board has a standing Nominating Committee that is composed of 100% of the Independent Trustees of the Trust. The Nominating
Committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board. The principal responsibility of the Nominating Committee is to consider, recommend and nominate candidates to fill vacancies on the Trusts Board, if any. The Nominating

ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the 1934 Act. The Trustees and officers of the Trust own less than 1% of the outstanding shares of the Trust.

 CODES OF ETHICS 
The Trust, the Adviser and the Distributor have each adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act. These codes of ethics are designed to
prevent affiliated persons of the Trust, the Adviser and the Distributor from engaging in deceptive, manipulative or fraudulent activities in connection with securities held or to be acquired by the Fund (which may also be held by persons subject to
the codes of ethics). These Codes prohibit personnel of the Adviser and the Distributor from investing in securities that may be purchased or held by the Fund. 
There can be no assurance that the codes of ethics will be effective in preventing such activities. Each code of ethics has been filed with the SEC and may be
examined at the office of the SEC in Washington, D.C. or on the Internet at the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov. 
PROXY VOTING POLICIES  The
Adviser exercises its proxy voting rights with regard to the holdings in the Funds investment portfolio with the goals of maximizing the value of the Funds investments, promoting accountability of a companys management and board of
directors (collectively, the Management) to its shareholders, aligning the interests of Management with those of shareholders, and increasing transparency of a companys business and operations. Unless otherwise directed by the
Board of the Trust, it is the policy of the Adviser to cast proxy votes in favor of proposals that the Adviser anticipates will enhance the long-term value of securities being voted. Generally, this will mean voting for proposals that the Adviser
believes will (a) improve the management of a company, (b) increase the rights or preferences of the voted securities or (c) increase the chance that a premium offer would be made for the company or for the voted securities. 
The Adviser seeks to avoid material conflicts of interest by applying detailed, pre-determined proxy voting guidelines (the Voting Guidelines) in
an objective and consistent manner and without consideration of any relationship factors. All proxy voting proposals are reviewed, categorized, analyzed and voted in accordance with the Voting Guidelines. These guidelines are reviewed periodically
and updated as necessary to reflect new issues and any changes in our policies on specific issues. Items that can be categorized under the Voting Guidelines will be voted in accordance with any applicable guidelines. Proposals that cannot be
categorized under the Voting Guidelines will be referred to the Portfolio Oversight Committee for discussion and vote. Additionally, the Portfolio Oversight Committee may review any proposal where it has identified a particular company, industry or
issue for special scrutiny. With regard to voting proxies of foreign companies, the Adviser weighs the cost of voting, and potential inability to sell the securities (which may occur during the voting process) against the benefit of voting the
proxies to determine whether or not to vote.  The Trust is required to disclose annually the Funds complete proxy voting record on Form N-PX
covering the period July 1 through June 30 and file it with the SEC no later than August 31. Information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12 month period is available
(1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-758-8320 and (2) on the SECs website at www.sec.gov.

INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES 
Pointbreak Advisers LLC, a Delaware limited liability company located at P.O. Box 347312, San Francisco, CA 94134, serves as the investment adviser to the
Fund. The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pointbreak Holdings Inc., a Delaware holding company. Mr. John Hyland, the Advisers Chief Executive Officer and a Trustee and Chairman of the Board of the Trust, is a partial owner of
Pointbreak Holdings Inc. In addition, Mr. Howard Mah, the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Trust and Adviser, as well as Ms. Heather Harker, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary of the Trust are partial owners of Pointbreak
Holdings Inc.  The Trust and the Adviser have entered into an investment advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement) with respect to the Fund.
Under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser serves as the investment adviser, makes investment decisions for the Fund, and manages the investment portfolios of the Fund, subject to the supervision of, and policies established by, the Board. The
Advisory Agreement provides that the Adviser shall not be protected against any liability to the Trust or its shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence generally in the performance of its duties hereunder or its
reckless disregard of its obligation and duties under the Advisory Agreement.  After the initial two-year term, the continuance of the Advisory Agreement
must be specifically approved at least annually: (i) by the vote of the Trustees or by a vote of the shareholders of the Fund; and (ii) by the vote of a majority of the Trustees who are not parties to the Advisory Agreement or
interested persons or of any party thereto, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. The Advisory Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment, and is terminable at any time
without penalty by the Trustees of the Trust or, with respect to the Fund, by a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, or by the Adviser on not more than 60 days nor less than 30 days written notice to the
Trust. As used in the Advisory Agreement, the terms majority of the outstanding voting securities, interested persons and assignment have the same meaning as such terms in the 1940 Act. 
For its services, the Adviser receives a fee that is equal to 0.34% per annum of the average daily net assets of the Fund, calculated daily and paid
monthly.  THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER 
This section includes information about the Funds portfolio manager, including information about other accounts he manages, the dollar range of Shares he
owns and how he is compensated.  COMPENSATION  Jason
LaMacchia is the Funds portfolio manager (the Portfolio Manager). The Portfolio Managers compensation includes a salary and discretionary bonus based on the profitability of the Adviser. No compensation is directly related to
the performance of the underlying assets.  SHARES OWNED BY PORTFOLIO MANAGERS 
As of the date of this SAI, the Portfolio Manager did not beneficially own Shares of the Fund.

 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  The
Portfolio Managers management of the Funds investments, on the one hand, and the investments of the other accounts, on the other may give rise to potential conflicts of interest. The other accounts may have the same investment objectives
as the Fund. Therefore, a potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the identical investment objectives, whereby the portfolio manager could favor one account over another. Another potential conflict could include the Portfolio
Managers knowledge about the size, timing and possible market impact of Fund trades, whereby a portfolio manager could use this information to the advantage of other accounts and to the disadvantage of the Fund he manages. However, the Adviser
has established policies and procedures to ensure that the purchase and sale of securities among all accounts the Adviser manages are fairly and equitably allocated. 
THE DISTRIBUTOR  The Trust
and ALPS Distributors, Inc. are parties to a distribution agreement (the Distribution Agreement), whereby the Distributor acts as principal underwriter for the Trusts Shares and distributes the Creation Units of the Fund. Shares
are continuously offered for sale by the Distributor only in Creation Units. Each Creation Unit is made up of 50,000 Shares. The Distributor will not distribute Shares in amounts less than a Creation Unit. The principal business address of the
Distributor is 1290 Broadway Street, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203.  Under the Distribution Agreement, the Distributor, as agent for the Trust, and upon
direction from the Fund, may enter into arrangements with broker-dealers who may solicit purchases of Shares, provided that any subscriptions and orders will not be binding on the Trust until accepted by the Trust. The Distributor will deliver
Prospectuses and, upon request, Statements of Additional Information to Authorized Participants purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of orders placed with it. The Distributor is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The Distributor may also
enter into agreements with securities dealers (Soliciting Dealers), upon direction from a Fund, who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of Shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as discussed in
Procedures for Creation of Creation Units below) or DTC participants (as defined below).  The Distribution Agreement will continue for two
years from its effective date and is renewable thereafter. The continuance of the Distribution Agreement must be specifically approved at least annually (i) by the vote of the Trustees or by a vote of the shareholders of the Fund and
(ii) by the vote of a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust and have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operations of the Distribution Agreement or any related agreement, cast in person at
a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. The Distribution Agreement is terminable without penalty by the Trust on 60 days written notice when authorized either by majority vote of its outstanding voting shares or by a
vote of a majority of its Board (including a majority of the Independent Trustees), or by the Distributor on 60 days written notice, and will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Distribution Agreement provides that in
the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence on the part of the Distributor, or reckless disregard by it of its obligations thereunder, the Distributor shall not be liable for any action or failure to act in accordance with its duties
thereunder.  Distribution Plan. The Trust has adopted a Distribution Plan (the Plan) in accordance with the provisions of Rule
12b-1 under the 1940 Act, which regulates circumstances under which an investment company may directly or indirectly bear expenses relating to the distribution of its shares. No distribution fees are currently charged to the Fund; there are no plans
to impose these fees. 
  21 


Table of Contents
Continuance of the Plan must be approved annually by a majority of the Trustees of the Trust and by a majority of
the Trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust and have no direct or indirect financial interest in the Plan or in any agreements related to the Plan (Qualified Trustees). The Plan requires that
quarterly written reports of amounts spent under the Plan and the purposes of such expenditures be furnished to and reviewed by the Trustees. The Plan may not be amended to increase materially the amount that may be spent thereunder without approval
by a majority of the outstanding shares of any class of the Fund that is affected by such increase. All material amendments of the Plan will require approval by a majority of the Trustees of the Trust and of the Qualified Trustees. 
The Plan provides that Shares (Shares) of the Fund pay the Distributor an annual fee of up to a maximum of 0.25% of the average daily net assets
of the Shares. Under the Plan, the Distributor may make payments pursuant to written agreements to financial institutions and intermediaries such as banks, savings and loan associations and insurance companies including, without limit, investment
counselors, broker-dealers and the Distributors affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, Agents) as compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with distribution assistance. The Plan is
characterized as a compensation plan since the distribution fee will be paid to the Distributor without regard to the distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor or the amount of payments made to other financial institutions and
intermediaries. The Trust intends to operate the Plan in accordance with its terms and with FINRA rules concerning sales charges.  Under the Plan, subject
to the limitations of applicable law and regulations, the Fund is authorized to compensate the Distributor up to the maximum amount to finance any activity primarily intended to result in the sale of Creation Units of the Fund or for providing or
arranging for others to provide shareholder services and for the maintenance of shareholder accounts. Such activities may include, but are not limited to: (i) delivering copies of the Funds then current reports, prospectuses, notices, and
similar materials, to prospective purchasers of Creation Units; (ii) marketing and promotional services, including advertising; (iii) paying the costs of and compensating others, including Authorized Participants with whom the Distributor
has entered into written Authorized Participant Agreements, for performing shareholder servicing on behalf of the Fund; (iv) compensating certain Authorized Participants for providing assistance in distributing the Creation Units of the Fund,
including the travel and communication expenses and salaries and/or commissions of sales personnel in connection with the distribution of the Creation Units of the Fund; (v) payments to financial institutions and intermediaries such as banks,
savings and loan associations, insurance companies and investment counselors, broker-dealers, mutual fund supermarkets and the affiliates and subsidiaries of the Trusts service providers as compensation for services or reimbursement of
expenses incurred in connection with distribution assistance; (vi) facilitating communications with beneficial owners of Shares, including the cost of providing (or paying others to provide) services to beneficial owners of Shares, including,
but not limited to, assistance in answering inquiries related to Shareholder accounts, and (vi) such other services and obligations as are set forth in the Distribution Agreement. 
THE ADMINISTRATOR  The
Trust and Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. (BBH or the Administrator) have entered into an administrative agency agreement (the Administration Agreement), under which the Administrator provides the Trust
with administrative services, including providing certain operational, clerical, recordkeeping and/or bookkeeping services. The principal business address of the Administrator is 50 Post Office Square, Boston, MA 02110. 
The Administration Agreement provides that the Administrator shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the
Trust in connection with the matters to which the Administration Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Administrator in the performance of its duties and obligations
thereunder.  For its services under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator is entitled to a fee based on the average daily net assets of the
Fund, and subject to a minimum annual fee.  The Adviser pays the Administrator its fee under the Administration Agreement. Any decrease in the
Administrators fee will decrease the amount paid by the Adviser to the Administrator.  The Fund is new and has not paid any amount to the
Administrator for administration services.

LEGAL COUNSEL  Reed Smith
LLP, with offices located at 1301 K Street, NW, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20005 serves as legal counsel to the Trust.
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Spicer Jeffries LLP, with offices located at 5251 S. Quebec Street, Greenwood Village, CO 80111 serves as the independent registered public accounting firm for
the Fund.  DESCRIPTION OF SHARES 
The Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number of funds and shares of each fund. Each share of a fund represents an equal
proportionate interest in that fund with each other share. Shares are entitled upon liquidation to a pro rata share in the net assets of the fund. Shareholders have no preemptive rights. The Declaration of Trust provides that the Trustees of the
Trust may create additional series or classes of shares. All consideration received by the Trust for shares of any additional funds and all assets in which such consideration is invested would belong to that fund and would be subject to the
liabilities related thereto. Share certificates representing shares will not be issued. The Funds shares, when issued, are fully paid and non-assessable. 
Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which a shareholder vote is required consistent with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder. Shares of all funds vote together as a single class, except that if the matter being voted on affects only a particular fund it will be voted on only by that fund and if a matter affects a particular fund differently from
other funds, that fund will vote separately on such matter. As a Delaware statutory trust, the Trust is not required, and does not intend, to hold annual meetings of shareholders. Approval of shareholders will be sought, however, for certain changes
in the operation of the Trust and for the election of Trustees under certain circumstances. Upon the written request of shareholders owning at least 10% of the Trusts shares, the Trust will call for a meeting of shareholders to consider the
removal of one or more trustees and other certain matters. In the event that such a meeting is requested, the Trust will provide appropriate assistance and information to the shareholders requesting the meeting. 
Under the Declaration of Trust, the Trustees have the power to liquidate each fund without shareholder approval. While the Trustees have no present intention
of exercising this power, they may do so if any fund fails to reach a viable size within a reasonable amount of time or for such other reasons as may be determined by the Board. 
BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS  The
policy of the Trust regarding purchases and sales of securities for the Fund is that primary consideration will be given to obtaining the most favorable prices and efficient executions of transactions. Consistent with this policy, when securities
transactions are effected on a stock exchange, the Trusts policy is to pay commissions, which are considered fair and reasonable without necessarily determining that the lowest possible commissions are paid in all circumstances. The Trust
believes that a requirement always to seek the lowest possible commission cost could impede effective portfolio management and preclude the Fund and the Adviser from obtaining a high quality of brokerage and research services. In seeking to
determine the reasonableness of brokerage commissions paid in any transaction, the Adviser will rely upon its experience and knowledge regarding commissions generally charged by various brokers and on its judgment in evaluating the brokerage
services received from the broker effecting the transaction. Such determinations are necessarily subjective and imprecise, as 
  23 


Table of Contents

in most cases, an exact dollar value for those services is not ascertainable. The Trust has adopted policies and procedures that prohibit the consideration of sales of the Funds shares as a
factor in the selection of a broker or dealer to execute its portfolio transactions.  The Adviser owes a fiduciary duty to its clients to seek to provide
best execution on trades effected. In selecting a broker/dealer for each specific transaction, the Adviser chooses the broker/dealer deemed most capable of providing the services necessary to obtain the most favorable execution. Best execution is
generally understood to mean the most favorable cost or net proceeds reasonably obtainable under the circumstances. The full range of brokerage services applicable to a particular transaction may be considered when making this judgment, which may
include, but is not limited to: liquidity, price, commission, timing, aggregated trades, capable floor brokers or traders, competent block trading coverage, ability to position, capital strength and stability, reliable and accurate communications
and settlement processing, use of automation, knowledge of other buyers or sellers, arbitrage skills, administrative ability, underwriting and provision of information on a particular security or market in which the transaction is to occur. The
specific criteria will vary depending upon the nature of the transaction, the market in which it is executed, and the extent to which it is possible to select from among multiple broker/dealers. The Adviser will also use electronic crossing networks
(ECNs) when appropriate.  The Adviser does not currently use the Funds assets for, or participate in, any third party soft dollar
arrangements, although it may receive proprietary research from various full service brokers, the cost of which is bundled with the cost of the brokers execution services. The Adviser does not pay up for the value of any such
proprietary research.  The Adviser is responsible, subject to oversight by the Adviser and the Board, for placing orders on behalf of the Fund for the
purchase or sale of portfolio securities. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Fund and one or more other investment companies or clients supervised by the Adviser are considered at or about the same time, transactions in such
securities are allocated among the several investment companies and clients in a manner deemed equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to all by the Adviser. In some cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price
or volume of the security so far as the Fund is concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower brokerage commissions will be beneficial to the Fund. The primary
consideration is prompt execution of orders at the most favorable net price.  The Fund may deal with affiliates in principal transactions to the extent
permitted by exemptive order or applicable rule or regulation.  Brokerage with Fund Affiliates. The Fund may execute brokerage or other agency
transactions through registered broker-dealer affiliates of the Fund, the Adviser or the Distributor for a commission in conformity with the 1940 Act, the 1934 Act and rules promulgated by the SEC. These rules require that commissions paid to the
affiliate by the Fund for exchange transactions not exceed usual and customary brokerage commissions. The rules define usual and customary commissions to include amounts which are reasonable and fair compared to
the commission, fee or other remuneration received or to be received by other brokers in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of time.
The Trustees, including those who are not interested persons of the Fund, have adopted procedures for evaluating the reasonableness of commissions paid to affiliates and review these procedures periodically. 
Securities of Regular Broker-Dealer. The Fund is required to identify any securities of its regular brokers and dealers (as
such term is defined in the 1940 Act) which it may hold at the close of its most recent fiscal year. Regular brokers or dealers of the Trust are the ten brokers or dealers that, during the most recent fiscal year: (i) received the
greatest dollar amounts of brokerage commissions from the Trusts portfolio transactions; (ii) engaged as principal in the largest dollar amounts of portfolio transactions of the Trust; or (iii) sold the largest dollar amounts of the
Trusts shares. The Fund is new and has no securities of regular broker dealers to report.  PORTFOLIO
TURNOVER RATE  Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as within a year. High turnover rates are likely to result in comparatively
greater brokerage expenses. The overall reasonableness of brokerage commissions is evaluated by the Adviser based upon its knowledge of available information as to the general level of commissions paid by other institutional investors for comparable
services. The Fund is new and has no portfolio turnover rate to report.

BOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM 
Depositary Trust Company (DTC) acts as securities depositary for the Shares. Shares of the Fund are represented by securities registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. Except in limited circumstances set forth below, certificates will not be issued for Shares. 
DTC is a limited-purpose trust company that was created to hold securities of its participants (the DTCs Participants) and to facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions among the DTC Participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the DTC Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC. More specifically, DTC is owned by a number of
its DTC Participants and by the NYSE and FINRA. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers, and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly
or indirectly (the Indirect Participants).  Beneficial ownership of Shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants, and persons
holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in Shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as Beneficial Owners) is shown on, and the transfer of
ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners
will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of Shares. The Trust recognizes DTC or its nominee as the record owner of all Shares for all purposes. Beneficial Owners of Shares are not entitled to
have Shares registered in their names, and will not receive or be entitled to physical delivery of share certificates. Each Beneficial Owner must rely on the procedures of DTC and any DTC Participant and/or Indirect Participant through which such
Beneficial Owner holds its interests, to exercise any rights of a holder of Shares.  Conveyance of all notices, statements, and other communications to
Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. DTC will make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee a listing of Shares held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall obtain from each such DTC Participant the number of Beneficial Owners holding
Shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement, or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may
reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and
reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.  Share
distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as the registered holder of all shares. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants accounts with payments in
amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of Shares held through such DTC Participants will
be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a street name, and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.
 The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of
beneficial ownership interests in the Funds shares, or for maintaining, supervising, or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or
the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants.  DTC may
determine to discontinue providing its service with respect to the Fund at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Fund and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Fund shall take
action either to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost or, if such replacement is unavailable, to issue and deliver printed certificates representing ownership of Shares, unless the Trust makes other arrangements
with respect thereto satisfactory to the Exchange.

CONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF SECURITIES 
A principal shareholder is any person who owns of record or beneficially 5% or more of the outstanding shares of a fund. A control person is a shareholder that
owns beneficially or through controlled companies more than 25% of the voting securities of a company or acknowledges the existence of control. Shareholders owning voting securities in excess of 25% may determine the outcome of any matter affecting
and voted on by shareholders of a Fund. The Fund is new and has no outstanding shareholders.  PURCHASE AND ISSUANCE OF
SHARES IN CREATION UNITS  The Trust issues and sells Shares of the Fund only in Creation Units on a continuous basis through the Distributor,
without a sales load (but subject to transaction fees), at their NAV per share next determined after receipt of an order, on any Business Day, in proper form pursuant to the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement (Participant
Agreement). The NAV of the Funds shares is calculated each business day as of the close of regular trading on the BATS, generally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The Fund will not issue fractional Creation Units. A Business Day is any day on
which the BATS is open for business.  FUND DEPOSIT. The consideration for purchase of a Creation Unit of the Fund generally consists of the in-kind
deposit of a designated portfolio of securities (the Deposit Securities) per each Creation Unit, constituting a substantial replication, or a portfolio sampling representation, of the securities included in the Funds Underlying
Index and the Cash Component (defined below), computed as described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of a cash in lieu amount (Deposit Cash) to be added
to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security. When accepting purchases of Creation Units for all or a portion of Deposit Cash, the Fund may incur additional costs associated with the acquisition of Deposit Securities that would otherwise be
provided by an in-kind purchaser.  Together, the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the Cash Component constitute the Fund
Deposit, which represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of the Fund. The Cash Component is an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the Shares (per Creation Unit)
and the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. If the Cash Component is a positive number (i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit exceeds the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as
applicable), the Cash Component shall be such positive amount. If the Cash Component is a negative number (i.e., the net asset value per Creation Unit is less than the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable),
the Cash Component shall be such negative amount and the creator will be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the Cash Component. The Cash Component serves the function of compensating for any differences between the net asset value per
Creation Unit and the market value of the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable. Computation of the Cash Component excludes any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit
Securities, if applicable, which shall be the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant (as defined below).  The Fund, through the National
Securities Clearance Corporation (the NSCC), makes available on each Business Day, immediately prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time), the list of the names and the required number of shares
of each Deposit Security or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, to be included in the current Fund Deposit (based on information at the end of the previous Business Day) for the Fund. Such Fund Deposit is subject to any applicable
adjustments as described below, in order to effect purchases of Creation Units of the Fund until such time as the next-announced composition of the Deposit Securities or the required amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, is made available. 
The identity and number of shares of the Deposit Securities or the amount of Deposit Cash, as applicable, required for the Fund Deposit for the Fund changes
as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by the Investment Adviser with a view to the investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to
adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities of the Funds Underlying Index.  The Trust reserves the right to permit or
require the substitution of an amount of cash (i.e., a cash in lieu amount) to replace any Deposit Security, which shall be added to the Deposit Cash, if applicable, and the Cash Component, including, without limitation, in
situations where the Deposit Security: (i) may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery; (ii) may not be eligible for transfer through the systems of DTC for corporate securities and municipal securities; (iii) may not be
eligible for trading by an Authorized Participant (as defined below) or the investor for which it is acting; (iv) would be restricted under 
  26 


Table of Contents

the securities laws or where the delivery of the Deposit Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant becoming
restricted under the securities laws; or (v) in certain other situations (collectively, custom orders). The Trust also reserves the right to include or remove Deposit Securities from the basket in anticipation of index rebalancing
changes. The adjustments described above will reflect changes, known to the Adviser on the date of announcement to be in effect by the time of delivery of the Fund Deposit, in the composition of the subject Index being tracked by the Fund or
resulting from certain corporate actions.  PROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE OF CREATION UNITS. To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor to purchase a
Creation Unit of the Fund, an entity must be (i) a Participating Party, i.e., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the Clearing
Process), a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC; or (ii) a DTC Participant (see BOOK ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM). In addition, each Participating Party or DTC Participant (each, an Authorized Participant) must
execute a Participant Agreement that has been agreed to by the Distributor, and that has been accepted by the Transfer Agent, with respect to purchases and redemptions of Creation Units. Each Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms
of a Participant Agreement, on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that it will pay to the Trust, an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component together with the Creation
Transaction Fee (defined below) and any other applicable fees and taxes. The Adviser may retain all or a portion of the Transaction Fee to the extent the Adviser bears the expenses that otherwise would be borne by the Trust in connection with the
purchase of a Creation Unit, which the Transaction Fee is designed to cover.  All orders to purchase Shares directly from the Fund must be placed for one
or more Creation Units and in the manner and by the time set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or applicable order form. The date on which an order to purchase Creation Units (or an order to redeem Creation Units, as set forth below) is
received and accepted is referred to as the Order Placement Date.  An Authorized Participant may require an investor to make certain
representations or enter into agreements with respect to the order, (e.g., to provide for payments of cash, when required). Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a Participant Agreement and that,
therefore, orders to purchase Shares directly from the Fund in Creation Units have to be placed by the investors broker through an Authorized Participant that has executed a Participant Agreement. In such cases there may be additional charges
to such investor. At any given time, there may be only a limited number of broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement and only a small number of such Authorized Participants may have international capabilities. 
On days when the Exchange closes earlier than normal, the Fund may require orders to create Creation Units to be placed earlier in the day. In addition, if a
market or markets on which the Funds investments are primarily traded is closed, the Fund will also generally not accept orders on such day(s). Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant by use of the Distributors electronic
order entry system, telephone or other transmission method acceptable to the Distributor pursuant to procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement and in accordance with the applicable order form. With respect to the Fund, the Distributor will
notify the Custodian of such order. The Custodian will then provide such information to the appropriate local sub-custodian(s). Those placing orders through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the
purchase order to the Distributor by the cut-off time on such Business Day. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or an Authorized Participant. 
Fund Deposits must be delivered by an Authorized Participant through the Federal Reserve System (for cash) or through DTC (for corporate securities) and/or
through such other arrangements allowed by the Trust or its agents. With respect to foreign Deposit Securities, the Custodian shall cause the sub-custodian of the Fund to maintain an account into which the Authorized Participant shall deliver, on
behalf of itself or the party on whose behalf it is acting, such Deposit Securities (or Deposit Cash for all or a part of such securities, as permitted or required), with any appropriate adjustments as advised by the Trust. Foreign Deposit
Securities must be delivered to an account maintained at the applicable local sub-custodian. The Fund Deposit transfer must be ordered by the Authorized Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit
Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, to the account of the Fund or its agents by no later than the Settlement Date. The Settlement Date for the Fund is generally the third Business Day after the Order Placement Date. All questions
as to the number of Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash to be delivered, as applicable, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities or cash, as applicable, will be determined by the
Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash represented by the Cash Component must be 
  27 


Table of Contents

transferred directly to the Custodian through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system or through DTC in a timely manner so as to be received by the Custodian no later than the Settlement
Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, are not received by the Custodian in a timely manner by the Settlement Date, the creation order may be cancelled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such
canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using the Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Fund.  The
order shall be deemed to be received on the Business Day on which the order is placed provided that the order is placed in proper form prior to the applicable cut-off time and the federal funds in the appropriate amount are deposited by 2:00 p.m. or
3:00 p.m. Eastern time (as set forth on the applicable order form), with the Custodian on the Settlement Date. If the order is not placed in proper form as required, or federal funds in the appropriate amount are not received by 2:00 p.m. or 3:00
p.m. Eastern time (as set forth on the applicable order form) on the Settlement Date, then the order may be deemed to be rejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable to the Fund for losses, if any, resulting therefrom. A creation request
is considered to be in proper form if all procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement, order form and this SAI are properly followed. 
ISSUANCE OF A CREATION UNIT. Except as provided herein, Creation Units will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the Trust of the Deposit
Securities or payment of Deposit Cash, as applicable, and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to the Custodian that the required Deposit Securities (or the cash value thereof) have been
delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor and the Adviser shall be notified of such delivery, and the Trust will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Units. The delivery of Creation Units so
created generally will occur no later than the third Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor. The Authorized Participant shall be liable to the Fund for losses, if any, resulting from
unsettled orders.  Creation Units may be purchased in advance of receipt by the Trust of all or a portion of the applicable Deposit Securities as
described below. In these circumstances, the initial deposit will have a value greater than the net asset value of the Shares on the date the order is placed in proper form since in addition to available Deposit Securities, cash must be deposited in
an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Cash Component, plus (ii) an additional amount of cash equal to a percentage of the market value as set forth in the Participant Agreement, of the undelivered Deposit Securities (the Additional
Cash Deposit), which shall be maintained in a separate non-interest bearing collateral account. An additional amount of cash shall be required to be deposited with the Trust, pending delivery of the missing Deposit Securities to the extent
necessary to maintain the Additional Cash Deposit with the Trust in an amount at least equal to the applicable percentage, as set forth in the Participant Agreement, of the daily marked to market value of the missing Deposit Securities. The
Participant Agreement will permit the Trust to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time. Authorized Participants will be liable to the Trust for the costs incurred by the Trust in connection with any such purchases. These costs will be deemed
to include the amount by which the actual purchase price of the Deposit Securities exceeds the market value of such Deposit Securities on the day the purchase order was deemed received by the Distributor plus the brokerage and related transaction
costs associated with such purchases. The Trust will return any unused portion of the Additional Cash Deposit once all of the missing Deposit Securities have been properly received by the Custodian or purchased by the Trust and deposited into the
Trust. In addition, a Transaction Fee as set forth below under Creation Transaction Fee will be charged in all cases. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the Settlement Date. 
ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS OF CREATION UNITS. The Trust reserves the absolute right to reject an order for Creation Units transmitted to it by the Distributor in
respect of the Fund including, without limitation, if (a) the order is not in proper form; (b) the Deposit Securities or Deposit Cash, as applicable, delivered by the Participant are not as disseminated through the facilities of the NSCC
for that date by the Custodian; (c) the investor(s), upon obtaining the Shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding Shares of the Fund; (d) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would have certain adverse tax
consequences to the Fund; (e) the acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (f) the acceptance of the Fund Deposit would otherwise, in the discretion of the Trust or the Adviser, have an adverse effect
on the Trust or the rights of beneficial owners; (g) the acceptance or receipt of the order for a Creation Unit would, in the opinion of counsel to the Trust, be unlawful; or (h) in the event that circumstances outside the control of the
Trust, the Custodian, the Transfer Agent, the Distributor and/or the Adviser make it for all practical purposes not feasible to process orders for Creation Units. 
Examples of such circumstances include acts of God or public service or utility problems such as fires, floods, extreme weather conditions and power outages
resulting in telephone, telecopy and computer failures; market conditions or activities 
  28 


Table of Contents

causing trading halts; systems failures involving computer or other information systems affecting the Trust, the Distributor, the Custodian, a sub-custodian, the Transfer Agent, DTC, NSCC,
Federal Reserve System, or any other participant in the creation process, and other extraordinary events. The Distributor shall notify a prospective creator of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of the creator of a
Creation Unit of its rejection of the order of such person. The Trust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian, any sub-custodian and the Distributor are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund
Deposits nor shall either of them incur any liability for the failure to give any such notification. The Trust, the Transfer Agent, the Custodian and the Distributor shall not be liable for the rejection of any purchase order for Creation Units.
 All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of any
securities to be delivered shall be determined by the Trust, and the Trusts determination shall be final and binding.  CREATION TRANSACTION FEE. A
purchase (i.e., creation) transaction fee is imposed for the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the purchase of Creation Units, and investors will be required to pay a creation transaction fee regardless of the number of
Creation Units created in the transaction. The Fund may adjust the creation transaction fee from time to time based upon actual experience. The standard fixed creation transaction fee for the Fund will be $350. Investors who use the services of a
broker or other such intermediary may be charged a fee for such services. Investors are responsible for the fixed costs of transferring the securities constituting the Deposit Securities to the account of the Trust. 
RISKS OF PURCHASING CREATION UNITS. There are certain legal risks unique to investors purchasing Creation Units directly from the Fund. Because the
Funds shares may be issued on an ongoing basis, a distribution of Shares could be occurring at any time. Certain activities that a shareholder performs as a dealer could, depending on the circumstances, result in the shareholder
being deemed a participant in the distribution in a manner that could render the shareholder a statutory underwriter and subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act. For example, a shareholder could be deemed a
statutory underwriter if it purchases Creation Units from the Fund, breaks them down into the constituent Shares, and sells those Shares directly to customers, or if a shareholder chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new Shares with an
active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary-market demand for Shares. Whether a person is an underwriter depends upon all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to that persons activities, and the examples mentioned here
should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could cause you to be deemed an underwriter.  Dealers who are not
underwriters but are participating in a distribution (as opposed to engaging in ordinary secondary-market transactions), and thus dealing with the Funds Shares as part of an unsold allotment within the meaning of
Section 4(3)(C) of the Securities Act, will be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(3) of the Securities Act. 
REDEMPTION. Shares may be redeemed only in Creation Units at their net asset value next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the
Fund through the Distributor and only on a Business Day. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE FUND, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM SHARES IN AMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS. Investors must accumulate enough Shares in the secondary market to constitute a
Creation Unit in order to have such Shares redeemed by the Trust. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the public trading market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to
incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of Shares to constitute a redeemable Creation Unit.  With respect to the
Fund, the Custodian, through the NSCC, makes available immediately prior to the opening of business on the Exchange (currently 9:30 a.m. Eastern time) on each Business Day, the list of the names and share quantities of the Funds portfolio
securities that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (Fund Securities). Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical
to Deposit Securities.  Redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit are paid either in-kind or in cash, or combination thereof, as determined by the Trust.
With respect to in-kind redemptions of the Fund, redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit will consist of Fund Securities  as announced by the Custodian on the Business Day of the request for redemption received in proper form plus cash in an
amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the Shares being redeemed, as next determined after a receipt of a request in proper form, and the value of the Fund Securities (the Cash Redemption Amount), less a fixed

  29 


Table of Contents

redemption transaction fee as set forth below. In the event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the net asset value of the Shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the
differential is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Trusts discretion, an Authorized Participant may receive the corresponding cash value of the
securities in lieu of the in-kind securities value representing one or more Fund Securities.  REDEMPTION TRANSACTION FEE. A redemption transaction fee is
imposed for the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the redemption of Creation Units, and investors will be required to pay a fixed redemption transaction fee regardless of the number of Creation Units created in the transaction, as
set forth in the Funds Prospectus, as may be revised from time to time. The redemption transaction fee is the same no matter how many Creation Units are being redeemed pursuant to any one redemption request. The Fund may adjust the redemption
transaction fee from time to time based upon actual experience. The standard fixed redemption transaction fee for the Fund will be $350. Investors who use the services of a broker or other such intermediary may be charged a fee for such services.
Investors are responsible for the fixed costs of transferring the Fund Securities from the Trust to their account or on their order.  PROCEDURES FOR
REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS. Orders to redeem Creation Units must be submitted in proper form to the Distributor prior to the time as set forth in the Participant Agreement. A redemption request is considered to be in proper form if
(i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Trusts Transfer Agent the Creation Unit(s) being redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be effective by the time as set forth in the
Participant Agreement and (ii) a request in form satisfactory to the Trust is received by the Distributor from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified in the Participant
Agreement, or order form, as the case may be. If the Transfer Agent does not receive the investors Shares through DTCs facilities by the times and pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the Participant Agreement, the
redemption request shall be rejected.  The Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption, in the form required by the Trust, to the
Distributor in accordance with procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not have executed a Participant Agreement, and that, therefore, requests to redeem Creation Units may have
to be placed by the investors broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed a Participant Agreement. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified by such Authorized
Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the Shares to the Trusts Transfer Agent; such investors
should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants. 
ADDITIONAL REDEMPTION PROCEDURES. In connection with taking delivery of shares of Fund Securities upon redemption of Creation Units, the Authorized
Participant must maintain appropriate custody arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the Fund Securities are customarily traded, to which account such Fund Securities will be
delivered. Deliveries of redemption proceeds generally will be made within three business days of the trade date.  The Fund may, in its sole discretion,
upon request of a shareholder, provide such redeemer a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of the Fund Securities but does not differ in net asset value. The Fund may also, in its sole discretion, upon request of a
shareholder, provide such redeemer a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of the Fund Securities but does not differ in net asset value. 
Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and the Fund (whether or not it
otherwise permits cash redemptions) reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Trust could not lawfully deliver specific Fund Securities upon redemptions or could not do so without first registering the Fund
Securities under such laws. An Authorized Participant or an investor for which it is acting subject to a legal restriction with respect to a particular security included in the Fund Securities applicable to the redemption of Creation Units may be
paid an equivalent amount of cash. The Authorized Participant may request the redeeming investor of the Shares to complete an order form or to enter into agreements with respect to such matters as compensating cash payment. Further, an Authorized
Participant that is not a qualified institutional buyer (QIB), as such term is defined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, will not be able to receive Fund Securities that are restricted securities eligible for resale
under Rule 144A. An Authorized Participant may be required by the Trust to provide a written confirmation with respect to QIB status in order to receive Fund Securities.

Table of Contents
The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to the Fund (1) for
any period during which the Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (2) for any period during which trading on the Exchange is suspended or restricted; (3) for any period during which an emergency exists as
a result of which disposal of the Shares of the Fund or determination of the NAV of the Shares is not reasonably practicable; or (4) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC. 
REQUIRED EARLY ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as described in the Participant Agreement and/or applicable order form, the Fund may
require orders to be placed up to one or more business days prior to the trade date, as described in the Participant Agreement or the applicable order form, in order to receive the trade dates net asset value. Authorized Participants may be
notified that the cut-off time for an order may be earlier on a particular business day, as described in the Participant Agreement and the order form. 
DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE 
Net asset value per Share for the Fund is computed by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (i.e., the value of its total assets less total
liabilities) by the total number of Shares outstanding, rounded to the nearest cent. Expenses and fees, including the management fees, are accrued daily and taken into account for purposes of determining net asset value. The net asset value of the
Fund is calculated by the Custodian and determined at the close of the regular trading session on the BATS (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each day that such exchange is open, provided that fixed-income assets may be valued as of the
announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments on any day that the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) announces an early closing time. 
In calculating the Funds net asset value per Share, the Funds investments are generally valued using market valuations. A market valuation
generally means a valuation (i) obtained from an exchange, a pricing service, or a major market maker (or dealer), (ii) based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of value supplied by an exchange, a pricing service, or a
major market maker (or dealer) or (iii) based on amortized cost. In the case of shares of other funds that are not traded on an exchange, a market valuation means such funds published net asset value per share. The Adviser may use various
pricing services, or discontinue the use of any pricing service, as approved by the Board from time to time. A price obtained from a pricing service based on such pricing services valuation matrix may be considered a market valuation. Any
assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at the current market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more sources. 
In the event that current market valuations are not readily available or such valuations do not reflect current market value, the Trusts procedures
require the Valuation Committee to determine a securitys fair value if a market price is not readily available. In determining such value the Valuation Committee may consider, among other things, (i) price comparisons among multiple
sources, (ii) a review of corporate actions and news events, and (iii) a review of relevant financial indicators (e.g., movement in interest rates, market indices, and prices from the Funds index provider). In these cases, the
Funds net asset value may reflect certain portfolio securities fair values rather than their market prices. Fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determination for a security is
materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of the security. In addition, fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Funds net asset value and the prices used by the
Funds Underlying Index. This may result in a difference between the Funds performance and the performance of the Funds Underlying Index. 
DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS 
The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in the Prospectus entitled Dividends, Distributions and
Taxes.  General Policies. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly by the Fund. Distributions of net
realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Fund may make distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund to improve index tracking or to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code, in all
events in a manner consistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act. 
  31 


Table of Contents
Dividends and other distributions on shares are distributed, as described below, on a pro rata basis to
Beneficial Owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners then of record with proceeds received from the Fund. 
The Fund may make additional distributions to the extent necessary (i) to distribute the entire annual taxable income of the Fund, plus any net capital
gains and (ii) to avoid imposition of the excise tax imposed by Section 4982 of the Code. Management of the Trust reserves the right to declare special dividends if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to
preserve the status of the Fund as a regulated investment company (RIC) or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income. 
Dividend Reinvestment Service. The Trust will not make the DTC book-entry dividend reinvestment service available for use by Beneficial Owners for
reinvestment of their cash proceeds, but certain individual broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by Beneficial Owners of the Fund through DTC Participants for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Investors should contact their brokers to ascertain the availability and description of these services. Beneficial Owners should be aware that each broker may require investors to adhere to specific procedures and timetables in order
to participate in the dividend reinvestment service and investors should ascertain from their brokers such necessary details. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically
reinvested in additional whole Shares issued by the Trust of the Fund at NAV per share. Distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Fund will nevertheless be taxable to Beneficial Owners acquiring such additional shares to the same extent
as if such distributions had been received in cash.  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES 
The following is only a summary of certain additional federal income tax considerations generally affecting the Fund and its shareholders. No attempt is made
to present a comprehensive explanation of the federal, state, local or foreign tax treatment of the Fund or its shareholders, and the discussion here and in the Prospectus is not intended to be a substitute for careful tax planning. 
The following general discussion of certain federal income tax consequences is based on provisions of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder as in
effect on the date of this SAI. New legislation, as well as administrative changes or court decisions, may significantly change the conclusions expressed herein, and may have a retroactive effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein.
 Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the application of the provisions of tax law described in this SAI in light of the
particular tax situations of the shareholders and regarding specific questions as to federal, state, or local taxes.  Regulated Investment Company
(RIC) Status. The Fund will seek to qualify for treatment as a RIC under the Code. Provided that for each tax year the Fund: (i) meets the requirements to be treated as a RIC (as discussed below); and (ii) distributes at least an
amount equal to the sum of 90% of the Funds net investment income for such year (including, for this purpose, the excess of net realized short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses) and 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income,
the Fund itself will not be subject to federal income taxes to the extent the Funds net investment income and the Funds net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed to the Funds shareholders. One of several requirements for
RIC qualification is that the Fund must receive at least 90% of the Funds gross income each year from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or
foreign currencies, or other income derived with respect to the Funds business of investing in stock, securities, foreign currencies and net income from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership (the 90% Test). A
second requirement for qualification as a RIC is that the Fund must diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the Funds taxable year: (a) at least 50% of the market value of the Funds total assets is represented
by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities, with these other securities limited, in respect to any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Funds total assets or
10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer; and (b) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets are invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, the
securities (other than securities of other RICs) of two or more issuers which the Fund controls and which are engaged in the same, similar, or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the
Asset Test). 
  32 


Table of Contents
Under the Asset Test, the Fund generally may not acquire a security if, as a result of the acquisition, more than
50% of the value of the Funds assets would be invested in (a) issuers in which the Fund has, in each case, invested more than 5% of the Funds assets and (b) issuers more than 10% of whose outstanding voting securities are owned
by the Fund. Because the Underlying Index has a relatively small number of constituents, the 5% limitation could affect the Funds ability to effectively implement a replication strategy or a representative sampling strategy. As the Fund grows,
the 10% limitation might also affect its ability to effectively implement a replication strategy or a representative sampling strategy.  If the Fund fails
to satisfy the 90% Test or the Asset Test, the Fund may be eligible for relief provisions if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid with respect to each failure to satisfy the applicable
requirements. Additionally, relief is provided for certain de minimis failures of the Asset Test. In order to qualify for relief provisions for a failure to meet the Asset Test, the Fund may be required to dispose of certain assets. If the
Fund fails to qualify for treatment as a RIC for any year, and the relief provisions are not available, all of its taxable income will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to
shareholders. In such case, its shareholders would be taxed as if they received ordinary dividends, although the dividends could be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders and the dividends may be eligible for the
lower tax rates available to non-corporate shareholders on qualified dividend income. To requalify for treatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, the Fund would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and to
distribute any earnings and profits from any taxable year for which the Fund failed to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If the Fund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the Fund would generally be required to
pay a Fund-level tax on any net built-in gains recognized with respect to certain of its assets upon a disposition of such assets within ten years of qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent year. The Board reserves the right not to maintain the
qualification of the Fund for treatment as a RIC if it determines such course of action to be beneficial to shareholders. If the Fund determines that it will not qualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund will establish procedures to reflect the
anticipated tax liability in the Funds NAV.  The Fund may elect to treat part or all of any qualified late year loss as if it had been
incurred in the succeeding taxable year in determining the Funds taxable income, net capital gain, net short-term capital gain, and earnings and profits. A qualified late year loss generally includes net capital loss, net long-term
capital loss, or net short-term capital loss incurred after October 31 of the current taxable year and certain other late-year losses.  If the Fund
has a net capital loss (that is, capital losses in excess of capital gains) for a taxable year, the excess of the Funds net short-term capital losses over its net long-term capital gains is treated as a short-term capital loss
arising on the first day of the Funds next taxable year, and the excess (if any) of the Funds net long-term capital losses over its net short-term capital gains is treated as a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of the
Funds next taxable year.  The Fund will generally be subject to a nondeductible 4% federal excise tax to the extent it fails to distribute by the
end of any calendar year at least the sum of 98% of its ordinary income for the year, 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ending on October 31 of that year, and certain other amounts. The Fund intends to make sufficient
distributions, or deemed distributions, to avoid imposition of the excise tax, but can make no assurances that all such tax liability will be eliminated. 
The Fund intends to distribute substantially all its net investment income and net realized capital gains to shareholders, at least annually. The distribution
of net investment income and net realized capital gains generally will be taxable to Fund shareholders regardless of whether the shareholder elects to receive these distributions in cash or in additional shares. However, the Fund may determine not
to distribute, or determine to defer the distribution of, some portion of its income in non-routine circumstances. If the Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net
short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its
shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares
of the income tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase
their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount of undistributed net capital gain included in their respective income over their respective income tax credits. Organizations or
persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their pro rata share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon timely filing appropriate returns or claims for refund with the Internal Revenue Service
(the IRS). 
  33 


Table of Contents
A portion of the net investment income distributions of the Fund may be treated as qualified dividend income
(which, for non-corporate shareholders, is generally eligible for taxation at reduced rates). The portion of distributions that the Fund may report as qualified dividend income is generally limited to the amount of qualified dividend income received
by the Fund, but if for any Fund taxable year 95% or more of the Funds gross income (exclusive of net capital gain from sales of stocks and securities) consists of qualified dividend income, all distributions of such income for that taxable
year may be reported as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is, in general, dividend income from taxable domestic corporations and certain foreign corporations (i.e., foreign corporations incorporated in a possession of the
United States or in certain countries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States, and other foreign corporations if the stock with respect to which the dividend income is paid is readily tradable on an established securities market in
the United States).  In order for some portion of the dividends received by a shareholder to be qualified dividend income, the Fund must meet holding
period and other requirements with respect to the dividend paying stocks in its portfolio, and the shareholder must meet holding period and other requirements with respect to the Funds shares. Distributions reported to Fund shareholders as
capital gain dividends will be taxable at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains (for taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2012, at a maximum rate of 20% for non-corporate shareholders), regardless of how long the
shareholder has owned the shares. The Funds shareholders will be notified annually by the Fund as to the federal tax status of all distributions made by the Fund. Distributions may be subject to state and local taxes. 
U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly) are subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on their
net investment income, including interest, dividends, and capital gains (including capital gains realized on the sale or exchange of shares of the Fund). This 3.8% tax also applies to all or a portion of the undistributed net investment
income of certain shareholders that are estates and trusts.  Shareholders who have held Fund shares for less than a full year should be aware that the
Fund may report and distribute, as ordinary dividends or capital gain dividends, a percentage of income that is not equal to the percentage of the Funds total ordinary income or net capital gain, respectively, actually earned during the period
of investment in the Fund.  If the Funds distributions for a taxable year exceed its taxable income and capital gains realized during a taxable
year, all or a portion of the distributions made for the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. A return of capital distribution will generally not be taxable, but will reduce each shareholders cost basis
in the Fund and generally result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. 
A sale or exchange of shares in the Fund may give rise to a capital gain or loss. In general, any capital gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of
shares will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than 12 months. Otherwise, the capital gain or loss on the taxable disposition of shares will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. Any loss
realized upon a taxable disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as long-term, rather than short-term, to the extent of any long-term capital gain distributions received (or deemed received) by the shareholder with respect
to the shares. All or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares will be disallowed if substantially identical shares are purchased (through reinvestment of dividends or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the
disposition. In such a case, the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.  An Authorized Participant who
exchanges securities for Creation Units generally will recognize a gain or a loss. The gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the market value of the Creation Units at the time and the sum of the exchangers aggregate basis in the
securities surrendered plus the amount of cash paid for such Creation Units. A person who redeems Creation Units will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the exchangers basis in the Creation Units and the sum of
the aggregate market value of any securities received plus the amount of any cash received for such Creation Units. The IRS, however, may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units cannot be deducted currently
under the rules governing wash sales, or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position.  Any capital gain or
loss realized upon the creation of Creation Units will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the securities exchanged for such Creation Units have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon the
redemption of Creation Units will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the shares comprising the Creation Units have been held for more than one year. Otherwise, such capital gains or losses will be treated as short-term capital
gains or losses.

Table of Contents
The Trust on behalf of the Fund has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the Trust if the
purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of the Fund and if, pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, the Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the
market value of such securities on the date of deposit. The Trust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination. The Trust reserves the absolute right to reject an
order for Creation Units if acceptance of the securities to be exchanged for the Creation Units would have certain adverse tax consequences to the Fund. 
Persons purchasing or redeeming Creation Units should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax treatment of any creation or redemption
transaction.  Foreign Investments. Income received by the Fund from sources within foreign countries (including, for example, dividends or interest
on stock or securities of non-U.S. issuers) may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such countries. Tax treaties between such countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes in some cases. If as of the end of the
Funds taxable year more than 50% of the value of the Funds assets consist of the securities of foreign corporations, the Fund may elect to permit shareholders who are U.S. citizens, resident aliens, or U.S. corporations to claim a
foreign tax credit or deduction (but not both) on their income tax returns for their pro rata portions of qualified taxes paid by the Fund during that taxable year to foreign countries in respect of foreign securities the Fund has held for at least
the minimum period specified in the Code. In such a case, shareholders will include in gross income from foreign sources their pro rata shares of such taxes. A shareholders ability to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of
foreign taxes paid by the Fund may be subject to certain limitations imposed by the Code, which may result in the shareholder not getting a full credit or deduction for the amount of such taxes. Shareholders who do not itemize on their federal
income tax returns may claim a credit, but not a deduction, for such foreign taxes.  Back-Up Withholding. The Fund or your broker will be required
to withhold (as backup withholding) on taxable dividends paid to any shareholder, as well as the proceeds of any redemptions of Creation Units, paid to a shareholder or Authorized Participant who (1) fails to provide a correct
taxpayer identification number certified under penalty of perjury; (2) is subject to withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report all payments of interest or dividends; (3) fails to provide a certified statement that he or she is
not subject to backup withholding; or (4) fails to provide a certified statement that he or she is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 28%. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax and any amounts withheld may be credited against the shareholders ultimate U.S. tax liability.  Foreign Shareholders. Foreign
shareholders (i.e., nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations, partnerships, trusts and estates) are generally subject to U.S. withholding tax at the rate of 30% (or a lower tax treaty rate) on distributions derived from net
investment income and short-term capital gains. Gains from the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund generally are not subject to U.S. taxation, unless the recipient is an individual who either (1) meets the Codes definition of
resident alien or (2) is physically present in the U.S. for 183 days or more per year. Different tax consequences may result if the foreign shareholder is engaged in a trade or business within the United States. In addition,
the tax consequences to a foreign shareholder entitled to claim the benefits of a tax treaty may be different than those described above.  Ordinary
dividends, redemption payments and certain capital gain dividends paid after June 30, 2014 (or in certain cases, after later dates) to a shareholder that is a foreign financial institution as defined in Section 1471 of the Code
and that does not meet the requirements imposed on foreign financial institutions by Section 1471 will generally be subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate. Under current IRS guidance, withholding on such payments began or will begin at
different times depending on the type of payment, the type of payee, and whether the shareholders account is opened before or after July 1, 2014. Withholding with respect to ordinary dividends began on July 1, 2014 for accounts
opened on or after that date and on certain later dates for accounts opened before July 1, 2014. Withholding on redemption payments and certain capital gain dividends is currently scheduled to begin on January 1, 2019. The extent, if any,
to which such withholding tax may be reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty is unclear. A non-U.S. shareholder may be exempt from the withholding described in this paragraph under an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the U.S.
and a foreign government, provided that the shareholder and the applicable foreign government comply with the terms of such agreement.  In order for a
foreign investor to qualify for an exemption from backup withholding, the foreign investor must comply with special certification and filing requirements. Foreign investors in the Fund should consult their tax advisors in this regard.

Table of Contents
Tax Shelter Reporting Regulations. Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if a shareholder recognizes a loss of
$2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many
cases excepted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance shareholders of a RIC are not excepted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayers
treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances. 
Other Issues. The Fund may be subject to tax or taxes in certain states where the Fund does business. Furthermore, in those states which have income
tax laws, the tax treatment of the Fund and of Fund shareholders with respect to distributions by the Fund may differ from federal tax treatment. 
Shareholders are advised to consult their tax advisors concerning their specific situations and the application of state, local and foreign taxes.

Table of Contents
Item 30. Indemnification 
Reference is made to Article Eight of the Registrants Declaration of Trust, which is incorporated by reference herein. The general effect
of the indemnification available to an officer or trustee may be to reduce the circumstances under which the officer or trustee is required to bear the economic burden of liabilities and expenses related to actions taken by the individual in his or
her capacity as an officer or trustee.  The Registrant (sometimes referred to as the Trust) is organized as a Delaware
statutory trust and is operated pursuant to a Declaration of Trust that permits the Registrant to indemnify every person who is, or has been, a trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust, including persons who serve at the request of the Trust
as directors, trustees, officers, employees or agents of another organization in which the Trust has an interest as a shareholder, creditor or otherwise (each, a Covered Person). Each Covered Person is indemnified by the Trust to the
fullest extent permitted by law against liability and against all expenses reasonably incurred or paid by him or her in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding in which he or she becomes involved as a party or otherwise by virtue of
his or her being or having been such a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent and against amounts paid or incurred by him in settlement thereof. This indemnification is subject to the following conditions: 
No indemnification is provided to a Covered Person: 
(a) For a liability to the Trust or its shareholders arising out of a final adjudication by the court or other body before which the
proceeding was brought that the Covered Person engaged in willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office; 
(b) With respect to any matter as to which the Covered Person has been finally adjudicated not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable
belief that his or her action was in the best interests of the Trust; or  (c) In the event of a settlement or other disposition not
involving a final adjudication (as provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above) and resulting in a payment by a Covered Person, unless there has been either a determination that such Covered Person did not engage in willful misfeasance, bad
faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or her office or position by the court or other body approving the settlement or other disposition, or a reasonable determination, based on a review of
readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that he or she did not engage in such conduct, such determination being made by: (i) a vote of a majority of the Disinterested Trustees (as such term is defined in
Section 8.5.5 of the Declaration of Trust) acting on the matter (provided that a majority of Disinterested Trustees then in office act on the matter); or (ii) a written opinion of independent legal counsel. 
The rights of indemnification under the Declaration of Trust may be insured against by policies maintained by the Trust are severable; will
not affect any other rights to which any Covered Person is entitled; will continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Covered Person; and will inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Nothing contained in
the Declaration of Trust will affect any rights to indemnification to which Trust personnel other than Covered Persons may be entitled by contract or otherwise under law. 
Expenses of preparation and presentation of a defense to any claim, action, suit or proceeding subject to a claim for indemnification under
Section 8.5 of the Declaration of Trust will be advanced by the Trust prior to final disposition thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the recipient to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not
entitled to indemnification under Section 8.5 of the Declaration of Trust, provided that either:  (a) Such undertaking is secured by
a surety bond or some other appropriate security or the Trust is insured against losses arising out of any such advances; or  (b) A
majority of the Disinterested Trustees acting on the matter (provided that a majority of the Disinterested Trustees then in office act on the matter) or independent legal counsel in a written opinion determines, based upon a review of the readily
available facts (as opposed to the facts available upon a full trial), that there is reason to believe that the recipient ultimately will be found entitled to indemnification. 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to trustees, officers and controlling
persons of the Registrant by the Registrant pursuant to the Declaration of Trust or otherwise, the Registrant is

aware that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act, and therefore, is unenforceable. In the event that a
claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by trustees, officers or controlling persons of the Registrant in connection with the successful defense of any act, suit or
proceeding) is asserted by such trustees, officers or controlling persons in connection with the shares being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a
court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issues.
