Management’s Assessment
 
Management of Wells
Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing (“CMS”), a division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (the “Company”),
is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) relating to the servicing of commercial mortgage loans by CMS (the “Platform”),
except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has
determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December
31, 2011. Appendix A to this letter identifies the commercial mortgage pools and other structures involving the commercial
mortgage loans constituting the Platform.
 
With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i),
1122(d)(3)(i)(A), 1122 (d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(vi), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform certain activities covered
by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that none of these vendors is a "servicer" as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company’s management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with these
servicing criteria to the extent they apply to these vendors as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation
Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). As permitted by Interpretation
17.06, the Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that such vendors' activities
comply in all material respects with servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(3)(i)(A), 1122 (d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(vi) to the
extent they apply. The Company is solely responsible for determining that the requirements of Interpretation 17.06 have been satisfied
with respect to these vendors and their performance of activities covered by servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(3)(i)(A),
1122 (d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(vi).
 
With respect to applicable servicing
criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2011 with respect to the Platform,
because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities.
 
The Company’s management has assessed
the Company’s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB with respect to
the Platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Based on such assessment, the Company’s
management believes that as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company has complied in all material respects with
the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB with respect to the Platform, except for the following
material noncompliance with servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i):
 
 

 
 
 
With respect to certain commercial
mortgage loans, the Company failed to timely file continuation statements for certain Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”)
financing statements as required by the transaction agreements, thereby causing such UCC financing statements to lapse.
As a result of the non-compliance
described above, certain non-possessory security interests in certain types of personal property collateral for these loans became
unperfected and, as a result, subject to a possible loss of priority.
 
 
Remediation
Promptly following
the Company’s discovery of such omissions as part of its normal internal compliance review process, the Company filed new
UCC financing statements in all cases. In order to reduce the possibility of similar occurrences in the future, the Company has
provided enhanced training to the responsible personnel, improved the quality of the relevant computer data feeds and generally
tightened its procedures for the filing of continuation statements.
 
KPMG LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to the Company’s compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011.

A slate of four new commercial mortgage backed deals this month cap a year of ups and downs for new CMBS deals and portends a strong start to 2012. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is bringing to market CFCRE Commercial Mortgage Trust 2011-C2. The offering is backed by 51 fixed-rate mortgage loans with an outstanding principal balance of $774.1 million. The mortgage loans are secured by first liens on 72 commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community properties in 19 states and the District of Columbia. UBS Investment Bank and Citigroup are offering UBS - Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2011-C1. The offering is backed by 32 fixed-rate mortgage loans with an outstanding principal balance of $673.9 million. The mortgage loans are secured by first liens on 38 commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community properties in 16 states. JPMorgan is offering a $374.6 million offering backed by the Palisades Center Mall in West Nyack, NY. And lastly, Freddie Mac is going to market with a $1 billion multifamily mortgage-backed securities offering (K-016 Certificates). The K-016 Certificates are backed by 85 recently originated multifamily mortgages and are guaranteed by Freddie Mac. The K-016 Certificates include two classes of senior principal and interest classes, a senior interest only class and a junior interest only class. According to Fitch Ratings, the key ratings drivers for Cantor Fitzgerald's CFCRE Commercial Mortgage Trust 2011-C2 are as follows. Secondary Markets: Several of the largest loans within the pool are backed by properties located in secondary markets. Locations such as Grandville, MI; Hanford, CA; and Hagerstown, MD; are all represented by top 10 loans. Lack of Operating History: Five of the top 10 loans did not have relevant operating histories due to new construction, renovation or property stabilization. Minimal Interest Only Loans. No loans in the pool are full-term interest only, and only one loan (7.6% of the pool) is partial-term interest only. As a result, the pool will have increased amortization and decreased balloon risk compared to other recent fixed-rate transactions. Hotel Concentration: Loans backed by hotel properties represent 15% of the pool, including six within the top 15. In addition, four of these hotel loans are sponsored by Apple REIT Eight Inc. (Apple REIT). The average Fitch LTV for hotels in the pool is 85.3%. Risk of Subordinate Debt: Four loans (28.3% of the pool) have subordinate debt in place. These loans have a weighted average Fitch LTV of 85.2% on the trust portion and 101.2% on the total debt stack. In addition, two loans (16.9% of the pool) allow for future subordinate debt. Kroll Bond Rating Agency is rating JPMCC 2011-PLSD. The transaction is secured by one 5-year, fixed-rate mortgage loan which amortizes based on a 30-year schedule. The mortgage is collateralized by a fee and leasehold interest in 1.94 million square feet of the Palisades Center. Palisades Center is a 2.26 million-square-foot super-regional mall. Kroll's analysis indicates a net cash flow of $43.1 million applied a 7.75% capitalization rate to arrive at a value of $555.6 million, which was 35% less than a third party appraisal value. The total indebtedness for this transaction of $524.6 million includes a $150 million mezzanine loan secured by pledges of equity interests in the borrower which is interest-only and with a maturity date that is co-terminus with the first mortgage. Fitch Ratings key ratings drivers for Freddie Mac's (K-016 Certificates are as follows. Property Type Concentration: The entire pool (100%) is secured by multifamily properties. Diverse Pool: The largest 10 loans account for only 34.7% of the pool balance. Strong Origination Practices: Freddie Mac multifamily loans had an average delinquency rate of 0.33% as of the third quarter of 2011, compared with 15.9% on Fitch-rated CMBS multifamily loans as of Aug. 5, 2011. The UBS - Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2011-C1 offering has yet to be rated. Tweet  Keep up weekly on  national news, trends and property leads with the Watch List Newsletter, a weekly pdf that  includes other news and leads not found on the CoStar Group web news pages.

Commercial Real Estate Direct Staff Report


The last CMBS transaction of the year, a $673.9 million conduit backed by loans originated by UBS Real Estate Securities Inc. and Natixis Real Estate Capital, has been launched. 


The deal, UBS-Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust, 2011-C1, would be the 18th conduit transaction of the year. Those have totaled $24.8 billion.


It is backed by 32 loans with a weighted average debt-service coverage ratio of 1.43x and loan-to-value ratio of 64.6 percent. 


The largest loan in the collateral pool is a $72 million piece of a $160 million senior mortgage against Trinity Centre, a 900,744-square-foot office property at 111-115 Broadway in lower Manhattan owned by Capital Properties Associates, which is led by Richard Cohen. The two-building complex was purchased by Capital Properties in 2000 for $129 million. It is 85 percent occupied and generated $15.7 million of net operating income over the 12 months through last July.


The debt, provided by UBS, pays a coupon of 5.897 percent and matures in 2021. It is senior to another $25 million of mezzanine debt, held by CreXus Investment Corp. and Brickman Associates, and was used to retire a total of $177 million of debt, pieces of which were securitized through Bear Stearns Commercial Mortgage Trust, 2004-PWR3, and Morgan Stanley Capital I Inc., 2004-TOP13. 


The UBS-Citigroup deal is divided into a total of 12 principal-paying classes and two interest-only classes that are being rated by DBRS and Moody's. It has five AAA/Aaa-rated bonds, four of which have 30 percent subordination levels and are being offered publicly, and one class with 21.875 percent subordination. That class, along with the deal's other bond classes, are being offered privately.


Wells Fargo is the deal's master servicer and Midland Loan Services is special servicer. Rialto Investments has circled the B-piece, giving it six B-piece acquisitions this year. 


The company, a unit of Miami homebuilder Lennar Corp., is led by Jeffrey Krasnoff, who previously had founded LNR Partners and built that company into the CMBS industry's most active B-piece buyer through 2008. As a result, it remains the industry's most active special servicer. 


Rialto, however, does not operate a special servicer and instead has been farming out that job, most recently to Midland. 


The company last year raised $300 million of equity commitments, including $75 million from Lennar, for Rialto Real Estate Fund, through which B-pieces have been acquired.
