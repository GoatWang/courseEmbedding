ImmunoGen, Inc. Presents Data from Phase I Study of IMGN779 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Jun 26 17
ImmunoGen, Inc. presented data from the ongoing Phase 1 study evaluating single agent IMGN779 in patients with relapsed or refractory adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whose tumors express CD33. These results were presented in a poster presentation on June 24, 2017, at the 22ndCongress of the European Hematology Association (EHA) in Madrid, Spain. IMGN779 combines a high-affinity, humanized anti-CD33 antibody with one of ImmunoGen’s novel indolino-benzodiazepine payloads, called IGNs, which alkylate DNA without crosslinking, resulting in potent anti-leukemia activity with relative sparing of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data, as well as initial anti-leukemia activity for IMGN779 through dose level seven were presented at EHA. Key findings included: No DLTs have been observed through dose level seven, with reported adverse events consistent with the underlying disease; No increase in the nature, frequency, or severity of any treatment-emergent adverse event has been reported with escalating doses and no evidence of cumulative toxicity has been observed with repeated dosing; Favorable PK/PD reveal prolonged exposure and CD33 saturation at dose levels six and seven; Initial anti-leukemia activity was observed at dose levels six and seven in patients who failed intensive frontline therapy. The Phase 1 trial is designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose for IMGN779 administered as monotherapy. The trial is also intended to evaluate safety and tolerability and characterize PK, PD, and preliminary anti-leukemia activity in relapsed or refractory AML. Dose escalation continues. Preclinical data for IMGN779 were also presented at EHA showing the agent is highly active in multiple AML xenograft models and is well-tolerated in preclinical repeat dosing regimens. Findings from the preclinical evaluation provided the foundation for the clinical evaluation of IMGN779 in AML.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

                        Mirvetuximab Soravtansine                    





Mirvetuximab soravtansine (IMGN853), an ADC, is a potential new treatment for patients with folate receptor alpha (FRα)-positive cancer. These include many ovarian cancers, as well as other types of solid tumors (e.g., endometrial).
Mirvetuximab soravtansine is ImmunoGen's lead program and is in clinical testing in the Phase 3 FORWARD I trial as a single agent for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The candidate is also being assessed in combination regimens for both platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive disease in the Phase 1b/2 FORWARD II trial.
For more information, visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.
The US Food and Drug Administration granted orphan drug designation to mirvetuximab soravtansine for the treatment of ovarian cancer; mirvetuximab soravtansine has also received this designation in the EU.
