ArcLight Completes $518 Million Co-Investment Transaction Supporting Enogex Investment

Jul 07, 2011, 14:59 ET
		  		  						
						 from   ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


BOSTON, July 7, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC ("ArcLight") today announced that its affiliate, Bronco Midstream Holdings, LLC ("Bronco"), has closed $518 million of co-investor commitments to support ArcLight's investment in Enogex Holdings, LLC.  The co-investor group was led by affiliates of China Investment Corporation, Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd, John Hancock Financial Services and The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company among a total group of 11 investors. Including commitments from funds managed by ArcLight and the co-investor group, Bronco will be able to support Enogex with over $1 billion of growth capital.
Daniel Revers, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of ArcLight, stated, "We are pleased to complete this important co-investment transaction with leading global institutions recognized for their sophistication and active participation as investors in the US energy infrastructure market.  The transaction is representative of the value that ArcLight is able to bring to its limited partners, portfolio companies and corporate partner relationships."
As initially announced in October 2010, Enogex Holdings is a joint venture between OGE Energy Corp. ("OGE") and ArcLight.  The joint venture owns Enogex LLC ("Enogex"), an integrated midstream infrastructure company which provides natural gas gathering, processing, pipeline transportation and storage services in the Mid-Continent of the United States. 
"Enogex's established asset base and strategic position within the US natural gas network provide the company significant and attractive growth opportunities from the continued development of the large unconventional natural gas resource plays now being actively pursued in the Mid-Continent and elsewhere," said Robb Turner, Co-Founder and Senior Partner of ArcLight.  "We and our co-investor partners are excited to be working with OGE and the management of Enogex during this unique period of opportunity for the company."

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
