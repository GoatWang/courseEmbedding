Jeffrey Schwaneke describes his role as Centene Corp.'s CFO as traditional. But given the initiatives he’s helped push through, the job is anything but.
Schwaneke was promoted to chief financial officer at Centene, the managed health care giant with more than $40 billion in 2016 revenue, in March 2016 after he served as chief accounting officer of the company for nearly eight years.

Within a month, he’d already steered the company through the final phases of a $6.8 billion acquisition and gotten the ball rolling on a massive $770 million headquarters expansion in downtown Clayton. To say he’s been busy would be quite an understatement.
“Certainly, there’s a lot of things that have happened,” he said.




Schwaneke was officially introduced as CFO on March 1, 2016, though he had been acting in that capacity for several months. He was responsible for guiding Centene through the last stage of its $6.8 acquisition of California-based Health Net. “It was a lot of the finer points of that transaction,” he said. “As with any acquisition, we had to get all the financing associated with that deal, and we had to go through the regulatory approval process that was lengthy and cumbersome.”
Schwaneke, 41, helped secure $2.7 billion in financing from Wells Fargo and steered Centene through a $2.27 billion debt offering to close funding the deal.
“Jeff played a pivotal role in the analysis and planning for the Health Net acquisition," said Centene CEO Michael Neidorff. "Jeff played an equally important role in negotiating the final deal and subsequently ensuring that the integration of all the financial systems and financial-related systems went very smoothly. He, along with two to three other people, were really accountable for making it happen and making it happen as well as it did."




 


The deal, which created the nation’s largest Medicaid managed care organization by adding Health Net’s Medicare platform to Centene’s existing Medicaid programs, closed in late March 2016. By then, the company was well underway with plans for its campus expansion, which was formally unveiled by the company in May 2016.

The expansion will include multiple office towers, parking garages, residential units, a hotel and a civic auditorium. The first phase of the project will include a 600,000-square-foot office tower, a 550,000-square-foot parking garage and retail space across Hanley Road from Centene’s current headquarters at 7700 Forsyth Blvd. Construction of the first phase is expected to start next month with the project completed in 2019.
Schwaneke said the company is still in the process of financing the project and could not comment further. “Obviously, we’ve started the project,” he said, noting Centene officials formally broke ground on the development last month. “I’ve been involved in regards to budgets and financing. It’s a process.”
Schwaneke figures to have his hands full for the foreseeable future.
Centene is projecting revenue of between $46 billion and $46.8 billion by the end of this year.
“We’re continuing to grow and we’ve grown fast in the eight years I’ve been here,” he said. “When I started, we had just $3.3 billion in revenue. Now we’re at (a projected) $46 billion, which is just a staggering amount of growth when you think about it.”
Schwaneke, his wife and their three children live in Town & Country. He said he attempts to take up golf, “but my handicap isn’t too great. Really my kids are young and I’m enjoying all their activities like soccer and baseball.” Schwaneke said he enjoys vacationing with his family as much as he can and tries to take an international trip at least once a year.
