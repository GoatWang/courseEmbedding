HEDGE fund managers are not short on chutzpah, as a rule. But it takes a special kind of cheek to ask investors at this very tender moment in the housing market for $750 million to fund a new company specializing in subprime residential mortgage loans.Michael W. Vranos, celebrity bond trader and founder of Ellington Management, has that audacity. And then some.Mr. Vranos oversees $5.4 billion in hedge funds and private accounts, and an additional $1.2 billion in a managed account, while also managing almost $23 billion in collateralized debt obligations (pools of loans backed by assets like home loans or credit card debt).That might be enough to keep others busy. But Mr. Vranos is also peddling shares in a new entity called Ellington Financial LLC. An offering statement, dated July 12, began circulating on Wall Street last week; it is a private placement aimed solely at institutional investors, like pension funds and insurance companies. Friedman Billings Ramsey is the underwriter.

On its face, it may sound like a promising deal for speculators. Subprime loans are in the tank, as everyone knows. Surely there is money to be made picking up distressed properties for pennies on the dollar. Continue reading the main story

And isn’t Mr. Vranos one of the world’s leading experts on mortgage securities? The Ellington prospectus certainly confirms this. “He was praised during the difficult bear market of 1994 by Jack Welch, chairman of Kidder Peabody’s parent company, General Electric,” it noted, “who said that Mr. Vranos ‘has done a better job than 99 percent of the managers at G.E. at managing a cycle.’ ”When Mr. Vranos was head of the mortgage securities trading desk at Kidder Peabody back in the early 1990s, Fortune magazine called him “one of the best bond traders on Wall Street,” the filing boasts.The filing is silent, however, on a near calamity Mr. Vranos had with his fund during the financial crisis of 1998. When Long Term Capital Management imploded that fall, credit markets seized. Three hedge funds run by Mr. Vranos lost about 25 percent of their value but stabilized after he auctioned $2 billion in securities to meet margin calls.ELLINGTON MANAGEMENT has obviously thrived since then. The filing shows that since 2000, Mr. Vranos has handily beaten the fixed-income average, producing double-digit gains in all those years but two.His performance so far this year is not as stellar. At the end of May, his mortgage-backed credit funds were up 1.8 percent; his “composite” hedge fund return for the period is 3.81 percent.But is now the time to raise $750 million in permanent capital on a subprime spending spree?Subprime mortgage loans are certainly far cheaper now than they were just a few months ago. Still, the shakeout in the industry may have only just begun. Last week, major lenders like Washington Mutual and Countrywide Financial said they would no longer offer the most popular subprime loans, those carrying low two- or three-year fixed rates that then reset to much higher levels. As access to those loans is cut off, subprime borrowers will have greater difficulty refinancing billions in mortgages whose rates are shooting up right now. Defaults are likely to rise, even from today’s high levels.Granted, timing is everything in market matters — and Mr. Vranos certainly has been through his share of up and down cycles.

Yet the timing of Ellington Financial’s hoped-for debut is intriguing because it appears to be a way for Mr. Vranos to unload subprime assets he bought a few months ago at higher prices than they would likely fetch today on investors.

Some $70 million of the offering’s proceeds is expected to go toward buying  equity in something called Spyridon Holdings, which owns a real estate investment trust that Mr. Vranos’s management company formed in May 2007. It bought $345 million of the riskiest portions of mortgage pools, known as equity residuals, issued by the New Century Financial Corporation, a subprime lender that declared bankruptcy in April. New Century made the loans from 2003 to 2006, the filing said.The $70 million earmarked from Ellington Financial’s investors to buy those assets will cover about 40 percent of the roughly $170 million Spyridon put up to buy them — it borrowed the rest. In return, Ellington Financial investors will receive 40 percent of Spyridon.But what inquiring Ellington investors should want to know is exactly how those New Century residuals are being valued and whether that amount reflects reality or fantasy.The Ellington prospectus says that the amount to be paid, estimated at $70 million, will be based “on fair market valuations of the New Century residuals provided at the time of purchase by one or more independent third parties.” But Ellington goes on to say that it expects any difference between those valuations and the $345 million purchase price to reflect only whatever cash the assets have distributed to Spyridon since they were bought and “any changes in interest rates over the course of such period.” Some $50 million in cash has been distributed by the New Century residuals, the filing said.No mention is made about the decline since May in the values of subprime loans over all and in New Century loans in particular. Even the lender’s high-grade paper is taking a hit — last week, Standard & Poor’s downgraded by one notch several AAA-rated New Century securities consisting of second lien assets.The problem, traders say, is that residual interests in New Century mortgage securities are not trading, so any valuation of the $345 million stake will likely be based on a model, not a true market. Besides, if the assets were such a good trade for Mr. Vranos, investors might be wondering, why is he sharing that largess?Asked Friday whether the offering is a way to dump poorly performing securities onto investors for a higher-than-market price, Mr. Vranos first said that I should not have obtained a copy of the prospectus because it is a private placement. All he would say about the New Century residuals is: “I don’t know if they’ve declined. I’m not responsible for pricing them — we use third-party pricing. That’s obviously a question that potential limiteds ask all the time. Obviously we have an answer.”Josh Rosner, an authority on mortgage-backed securities at Graham-Fisher, an independent research firm in New York, looked at the Ellington Financial filing details that I forwarded to him. He said: “If you are exposed to significant losses on a mark-to-market basis, your goal is, within the legal framework, to avoid having to take that mark. One of the ways that people are starting to avoid that is to resecuritize assets and put them into other vehicles at par. I think there is a strong chance that may be what’s happening here.”So in addition to jettisoning some of the New Century residuals, the transaction with Ellington Financial may allow Mr. Vranos to value those that he owns elsewhere in his financial empire at a higher price than he otherwise could.

Hedge funds are unregulated entities and they want to remain that way. That is fine with me. But transactions like this one seem almost certain to draw scrutiny. And hedge fund managers as smart as Mr. Vranos should know that.

Title
Founder, CEO


Michael W. "Mike" Vranos is an American hedge fund manager and philanthropist who in the 1990s was referred to by some as the "most powerful man on Wall Street."[1] In 1993, he reportedly earned $15 million from trading mortgage bonds.[2] Fortune Magazine once called him "one of the best bond traders on Wall Street."[3] According to a 2007 Wall Street Journal article, he has continued to be regarded as "the best-known mortgage-bond trader on Wall Street."[4]
Vranos headed collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) trading in the early 1990s at Kidder Peabody at a time when that firm dominated the marketplace.[3] Seizing the opportunity created by a bear market, he left to start his own firm, Ellington Management Group, in late 1994.[3] That same year, Kidder Peabody fell on troubled times and was sold to PaineWebber.[5] In spite of being affected by fall-out from the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998,[6] as of April 2004, Ellington had delivered a composite annualized return of 15.4%, after fees.[7] Ellington continues to market a variety of investment offerings.[8]

Early life and education[edit]
Vranos was born in Worcester, Massachusetts to Alexander and Aglaea Vranos, both of Greek descent.[9] He was then raised in Ellington, Connecticut, United States. In his youth, he worked as a bouncer and earned the title of Mr. Teen Connecticut as a bodybuilder.[10] He earned the nickname "The Arm".[11] Mr. Vranos earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Harvard University in 1983 with both magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa honors.[3] He began pursuing a PhD in Mathematics, before beginning his work on Wall Street.[12]
Kidder Peabody[edit]
Vranos started work at Kidder Peabody after graduation from Harvard in 1983. He was the youngest Managing Director in the 130-year history of Kidder Peabody.[3] During his reign at Kidder Peabody from 1990–1994, Kidder underwrote over $200 billion in CMOs, which was about 20% of all CMOs issued during that period and nearly double the next largest Wall Street firm.[3] Vranos was noted for having turned his collateralized mortgage obligation trading role into a money-making machine.[13] In 1991, Vranos was named Kidder Peabody’s Man of the Year. His 1992 compensation was estimated at between $10–15 million, according to the USA Today,[14] while The Washington Post reported it in the $5–7 million range.[15] By 1993 he was the highest paid employee at Kidder Peabody, and it was said that as Kidder entered financial trouble in the early 1990s that the profitability of the company was largely on Vranos' back.[16]
Kidder Peabody fell on troubled times during the bear market of 1994. Losses in the mortgage-bonds department headed by Vranos for the second quarter of 1994 were $30 million. Michael Carpenter, the CEO of Kidder from 1989 to 1994 was forced to resign in July 1994.[5][17] Then, when the number two ranking executive at the firm, Edward A. Cerullo, resigned from Kidder Peabody a few weeks later, Vranos was one of the most watched firm members.[18] During this period, Vranos was highly praised by Jack Welch, chairman of Kidder Peabody’s parent company, General Electric, for his handling of the bear market.[3] However, as market conditions grew more severe, Vranos left to start his own firm in late 1994. Kidder was ultimately sold to Paine Webber.[2]
Ellington Management Group[edit]




Michael Vranos in front of the New York Stock Exchange


In late 1994, Vranos founded Ellington Management Group, which grew into a $21 billion company.[3] He founded the firm with Laurence Penn, whom Vranos knew at Havard and who was in charge of Lehman Brother's mortgage securities training before co-founding Ellington with funding from Ziff Brothers Investments. By the end of 1995 the firm had become a three-fund operation with a variety of assets.[19]
Ellington was affected by the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998.[2] For a few days in mid-October, the firm sold mortgage securities to lower its funds' leverage.[20][21] The firm issued a public statement describing its borrowings to quell public fears, which was quite unusual for hedge funds at the time.[6] It clarified that although it was meeting margin calls by unloading hundreds of millions of dollars in assets over a two-day period, losses were limited.[22] One report suggests some of his hedge funds may have temporarily lost around 25% of their value as he liquidated $2 billion in assets[8] after allegedly missing a margin call from UBS.[23][24] However, from its December 1994 inception through April 2004, the firm delivered a composite annualized return of 15.4%, after fees.[7]
In 2000, Ellington bid on Laser Mortgage Management Inc., a mortgage real estate investment trust that was considering closing, but ultimately did not purchase it.[25] Various of Ellington's funds have invested in distressed mortgage-backed securities over time.[26] By 2004 his $3 billion in hedge fund assets including mortgage derivatives.[27] In October 2007, as the future credit performance of residential mortgages became increasingly uncertain, one of his funds is reported to have fallen in value by 22%[4] and to have temporarily suspended redemptions pending greater clarity around valuations.[28] As of 2007, Vranos and Ellington Management managed $5.4 billion in hedge funds and private accounts, and an additional $1.2 billion in a managed account, while also managing almost $23 billion in collateralized debt obligations.[8]
In June 2007, Vranos launched a private placement of a new entity, Ellington Financial LLC, to institutional investors.[8] The offering primarily targeted investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities. The deal was underwriten by Friedman Billings Ramsey and although originally slated for a $750 million offering,[8] evolving market conditions only allowed for a $250 million capital raise.[4] Before the private placement, a New York Times columnist noted that a portion of the private placement might be used to purchase risky tranches from bankrupt subprime lender New Century Financial Corporation and noted the potential difficulty in valuing such instruments.[8]
In October 2010, Ellington Financial LLC went public, debuting on the NYSE.[29] As of 2 January 2012[update], Vranos owned (directly or indirectly) over 2.50 million shares.[30] According to its public filings, Ellington Financial invests primarily in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, but also holds agency pools and other mortgage-related securities, and had a total return of 59% between its August 2007 inception and the end of 2011.[31] In the 2010s, Ellington opened a second office in London in order to expand into the European market.[32] Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT, chaired and founded by Vranos, went public on the NYSE after its IPO in late 2013, trading under the ticker symbol EARN.[33] In 2014 Vranos opened an office for Ellington Management in London, England.[34]
Personal[edit]
In 1981, Vranos was declared Mr. Teen Connecticut in the state's bodybuilding championships, and he became known as "Captain Iron" in bodybuilding circles.[35] Vranos is known for breaking up business meetings to issue armwrestling challenges.[5] Vranos currently lives in Weston, Connecticut. In 2001, Slate.com finance columnist Rob Walker and alternative cartoonist Josh Neufeld featured Vranos in their comic book, Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001, ISBN 1-891867-05-9).[36][37] Vranos supported both Christopher Dodd and Barack Obama on the Democratic side and Rudy Giuliani on the Republican side of the 2008 Presidential Election.[38]
Philanthropy[edit]
Michael Vranos is a director of Hedge Funds Care, Boys & Girls Harbor, the Waterside School in Stamford, and Hopkins school in New Haven. He is a contributor to and former director of Stamford Shelter for the Homeless and the East Harlem School.[3][39][40] Hedge Funds Care presented Vranos with its Lifetime Award for Caring in 2007.[41] He also established the Michael and Anna Vranos Graduate Fellowship Fund in the Life Sciences, the Vranos Family Junior Faculty Development Fund for Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, and the Vranos Family Graduate Research Fellowship in Developmental and Regenerative Biology, all at Harvard University. According to Harvard Alumni, "He has also offered his time and support to Harvard as a member of the FAS Task Force on Balanced Philanthropy, as chair of the Class of 1983 Gift Committee, as af member of the New York Major Gifts Committee, and as chair of the Class of 1983’s 20th and 25th reunions."[12]

Early life and education[edit]
Vranos was born in Worcester, Massachusetts to Alexander and Aglaea Vranos, both of Greek descent.[9] He was then raised in Ellington, Connecticut, United States. In his youth, he worked as a bouncer and earned the title of Mr. Teen Connecticut as a bodybuilder.[10] He earned the nickname "The Arm".[11] Mr. Vranos earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Harvard University in 1983 with both magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa honors.[3] He began pursuing a PhD in Mathematics, before beginning his work on Wall Street.[12]
Kidder Peabody[edit]
Vranos started work at Kidder Peabody after graduation from Harvard in 1983. He was the youngest Managing Director in the 130-year history of Kidder Peabody.[3] During his reign at Kidder Peabody from 1990–1994, Kidder underwrote over $200 billion in CMOs, which was about 20% of all CMOs issued during that period and nearly double the next largest Wall Street firm.[3] Vranos was noted for having turned his collateralized mortgage obligation trading role into a money-making machine.[13] In 1991, Vranos was named Kidder Peabody’s Man of the Year. His 1992 compensation was estimated at between $10–15 million, according to the USA Today,[14] while The Washington Post reported it in the $5–7 million range.[15] By 1993 he was the highest paid employee at Kidder Peabody, and it was said that as Kidder entered financial trouble in the early 1990s that the profitability of the company was largely on Vranos' back.[16]
Kidder Peabody fell on troubled times during the bear market of 1994. Losses in the mortgage-bonds department headed by Vranos for the second quarter of 1994 were $30 million. Michael Carpenter, the CEO of Kidder from 1989 to 1994 was forced to resign in July 1994.[5][17] Then, when the number two ranking executive at the firm, Edward A. Cerullo, resigned from Kidder Peabody a few weeks later, Vranos was one of the most watched firm members.[18] During this period, Vranos was highly praised by Jack Welch, chairman of Kidder Peabody’s parent company, General Electric, for his handling of the bear market.[3] However, as market conditions grew more severe, Vranos left to start his own firm in late 1994. Kidder was ultimately sold to Paine Webber.[2]
Ellington Management Group[edit]

In late 1994, Vranos founded Ellington Management Group, which grew into a $21 billion company.[3] He founded the firm with Laurence Penn, whom Vranos knew at Havard and who was in charge of Lehman Brother's mortgage securities training before co-founding Ellington with funding from Ziff Brothers Investments. By the end of 1995 the firm had become a three-fund operation with a variety of assets.[19]
Ellington was affected by the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998.[2] For a few days in mid-October, the firm sold mortgage securities to lower its funds' leverage.[20][21] The firm issued a public statement describing its borrowings to quell public fears, which was quite unusual for hedge funds at the time.[6] It clarified that although it was meeting margin calls by unloading hundreds of millions of dollars in assets over a two-day period, losses were limited.[22] One report suggests some of his hedge funds may have temporarily lost around 25% of their value as he liquidated $2 billion in assets[8] after allegedly missing a margin call from UBS.[23][24] However, from its December 1994 inception through April 2004, the firm delivered a composite annualized return of 15.4%, after fees.[7]
In 2000, Ellington bid on Laser Mortgage Management Inc., a mortgage real estate investment trust that was considering closing, but ultimately did not purchase it.[25] Various of Ellington's funds have invested in distressed mortgage-backed securities over time.[26] By 2004 his $3 billion in hedge fund assets including mortgage derivatives.[27] In October 2007, as the future credit performance of residential mortgages became increasingly uncertain, one of his funds is reported to have fallen in value by 22%[4] and to have temporarily suspended redemptions pending greater clarity around valuations.[28] As of 2007, Vranos and Ellington Management managed $5.4 billion in hedge funds and private accounts, and an additional $1.2 billion in a managed account, while also managing almost $23 billion in collateralized debt obligations.[8]
In June 2007, Vranos launched a private placement of a new entity, Ellington Financial LLC, to institutional investors.[8] The offering primarily targeted investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities. The deal was underwriten by Friedman Billings Ramsey and although originally slated for a $750 million offering,[8] evolving market conditions only allowed for a $250 million capital raise.[4] Before the private placement, a New York Times columnist noted that a portion of the private placement might be used to purchase risky tranches from bankrupt subprime lender New Century Financial Corporation and noted the potential difficulty in valuing such instruments.[8]
In October 2010, Ellington Financial LLC went public, debuting on the NYSE.[29] As of 2 January 2012[update], Vranos owned (directly or indirectly) over 2.50 million shares.[30] According to its public filings, Ellington Financial invests primarily in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, but also holds agency pools and other mortgage-related securities, and had a total return of 59% between its August 2007 inception and the end of 2011.[31] In the 2010s, Ellington opened a second office in London in order to expand into the European market.[32] Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT, chaired and founded by Vranos, went public on the NYSE after its IPO in late 2013, trading under the ticker symbol EARN.[33] In 2014 Vranos opened an office for Ellington Management in London, England.[34]
Personal[edit]
In 1981, Vranos was declared Mr. Teen Connecticut in the state's bodybuilding championships, and he became known as "Captain Iron" in bodybuilding circles.[35] Vranos is known for breaking up business meetings to issue armwrestling challenges.[5] Vranos currently lives in Weston, Connecticut. In 2001, Slate.com finance columnist Rob Walker and alternative cartoonist Josh Neufeld featured Vranos in their comic book, Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001, ISBN 1-891867-05-9).[36][37] Vranos supported both Christopher Dodd and Barack Obama on the Democratic side and Rudy Giuliani on the Republican side of the 2008 Presidential Election.[38]
Philanthropy[edit]
Michael Vranos is a director of Hedge Funds Care, Boys & Girls Harbor, the Waterside School in Stamford, and Hopkins school in New Haven. He is a contributor to and former director of Stamford Shelter for the Homeless and the East Harlem School.[3][39][40] Hedge Funds Care presented Vranos with its Lifetime Award for Caring in 2007.[41] He also established the Michael and Anna Vranos Graduate Fellowship Fund in the Life Sciences, the Vranos Family Junior Faculty Development Fund for Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, and the Vranos Family Graduate Research Fellowship in Developmental and Regenerative Biology, all at Harvard University. According to Harvard Alumni, "He has also offered his time and support to Harvard as a member of the FAS Task Force on Balanced Philanthropy, as chair of the Class of 1983 Gift Committee, as af member of the New York Major Gifts Committee, and as chair of the Class of 1983’s 20th and 25th reunions."[12]

Title
Founder, CEO


Michael W. "Mike" Vranos is an American hedge fund manager and philanthropist who in the 1990s was referred to by some as the "most powerful man on Wall Street."[1] In 1993, he reportedly earned $15 million from trading mortgage bonds.[2] Fortune Magazine once called him "one of the best bond traders on Wall Street."[3] According to a 2007 Wall Street Journal article, he has continued to be regarded as "the best-known mortgage-bond trader on Wall Street."[4]
Vranos headed collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) trading in the early 1990s at Kidder Peabody at a time when that firm dominated the marketplace.[3] Seizing the opportunity created by a bear market, he left to start his own firm, Ellington Management Group, in late 1994.[3] That same year, Kidder Peabody fell on troubled times and was sold to PaineWebber.[5] In spite of being affected by fall-out from the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998,[6] as of April 2004, Ellington had delivered a composite annualized return of 15.4%, after fees.[7] Ellington continues to market a variety of investment offerings.[8]

Early life and education[edit]
Vranos was born in Worcester, Massachusetts to Alexander and Aglaea Vranos, both of Greek descent.[9] He was then raised in Ellington, Connecticut, United States. In his youth, he worked as a bouncer and earned the title of Mr. Teen Connecticut as a bodybuilder.[10] He earned the nickname "The Arm".[11] Mr. Vranos earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Harvard University in 1983 with both magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa honors.[3] He began pursuing a PhD in Mathematics, before beginning his work on Wall Street.[12]
Kidder Peabody[edit]
Vranos started work at Kidder Peabody after graduation from Harvard in 1983. He was the youngest Managing Director in the 130-year history of Kidder Peabody.[3] During his reign at Kidder Peabody from 1990–1994, Kidder underwrote over $200 billion in CMOs, which was about 20% of all CMOs issued during that period and nearly double the next largest Wall Street firm.[3] Vranos was noted for having turned his collateralized mortgage obligation trading role into a money-making machine.[13] In 1991, Vranos was named Kidder Peabody’s Man of the Year. His 1992 compensation was estimated at between $10–15 million, according to the USA Today,[14] while The Washington Post reported it in the $5–7 million range.[15] By 1993 he was the highest paid employee at Kidder Peabody, and it was said that as Kidder entered financial trouble in the early 1990s that the profitability of the company was largely on Vranos' back.[16]
Kidder Peabody fell on troubled times during the bear market of 1994. Losses in the mortgage-bonds department headed by Vranos for the second quarter of 1994 were $30 million. Michael Carpenter, the CEO of Kidder from 1989 to 1994 was forced to resign in July 1994.[5][17] Then, when the number two ranking executive at the firm, Edward A. Cerullo, resigned from Kidder Peabody a few weeks later, Vranos was one of the most watched firm members.[18] During this period, Vranos was highly praised by Jack Welch, chairman of Kidder Peabody’s parent company, General Electric, for his handling of the bear market.[3] However, as market conditions grew more severe, Vranos left to start his own firm in late 1994. Kidder was ultimately sold to Paine Webber.[2]
Ellington Management Group[edit]




Michael Vranos in front of the New York Stock Exchange


In late 1994, Vranos founded Ellington Management Group, which grew into a $21 billion company.[3] He founded the firm with Laurence Penn, whom Vranos knew at Havard and who was in charge of Lehman Brother's mortgage securities training before co-founding Ellington with funding from Ziff Brothers Investments. By the end of 1995 the firm had become a three-fund operation with a variety of assets.[19]
Ellington was affected by the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998.[2] For a few days in mid-October, the firm sold mortgage securities to lower its funds' leverage.[20][21] The firm issued a public statement describing its borrowings to quell public fears, which was quite unusual for hedge funds at the time.[6] It clarified that although it was meeting margin calls by unloading hundreds of millions of dollars in assets over a two-day period, losses were limited.[22] One report suggests some of his hedge funds may have temporarily lost around 25% of their value as he liquidated $2 billion in assets[8] after allegedly missing a margin call from UBS.[23][24] However, from its December 1994 inception through April 2004, the firm delivered a composite annualized return of 15.4%, after fees.[7]
In 2000, Ellington bid on Laser Mortgage Management Inc., a mortgage real estate investment trust that was considering closing, but ultimately did not purchase it.[25] Various of Ellington's funds have invested in distressed mortgage-backed securities over time.[26] By 2004 his $3 billion in hedge fund assets including mortgage derivatives.[27] In October 2007, as the future credit performance of residential mortgages became increasingly uncertain, one of his funds is reported to have fallen in value by 22%[4] and to have temporarily suspended redemptions pending greater clarity around valuations.[28] As of 2007, Vranos and Ellington Management managed $5.4 billion in hedge funds and private accounts, and an additional $1.2 billion in a managed account, while also managing almost $23 billion in collateralized debt obligations.[8]
In June 2007, Vranos launched a private placement of a new entity, Ellington Financial LLC, to institutional investors.[8] The offering primarily targeted investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities. The deal was underwriten by Friedman Billings Ramsey and although originally slated for a $750 million offering,[8] evolving market conditions only allowed for a $250 million capital raise.[4] Before the private placement, a New York Times columnist noted that a portion of the private placement might be used to purchase risky tranches from bankrupt subprime lender New Century Financial Corporation and noted the potential difficulty in valuing such instruments.[8]
In October 2010, Ellington Financial LLC went public, debuting on the NYSE.[29] As of 2 January 2012[update], Vranos owned (directly or indirectly) over 2.50 million shares.[30] According to its public filings, Ellington Financial invests primarily in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, but also holds agency pools and other mortgage-related securities, and had a total return of 59% between its August 2007 inception and the end of 2011.[31] In the 2010s, Ellington opened a second office in London in order to expand into the European market.[32] Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT, chaired and founded by Vranos, went public on the NYSE after its IPO in late 2013, trading under the ticker symbol EARN.[33] In 2014 Vranos opened an office for Ellington Management in London, England.[34]
Personal[edit]
In 1981, Vranos was declared Mr. Teen Connecticut in the state's bodybuilding championships, and he became known as "Captain Iron" in bodybuilding circles.[35] Vranos is known for breaking up business meetings to issue armwrestling challenges.[5] Vranos currently lives in Weston, Connecticut. In 2001, Slate.com finance columnist Rob Walker and alternative cartoonist Josh Neufeld featured Vranos in their comic book, Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001, ISBN 1-891867-05-9).[36][37] Vranos supported both Christopher Dodd and Barack Obama on the Democratic side and Rudy Giuliani on the Republican side of the 2008 Presidential Election.[38]
Philanthropy[edit]
Michael Vranos is a director of Hedge Funds Care, Boys & Girls Harbor, the Waterside School in Stamford, and Hopkins school in New Haven. He is a contributor to and former director of Stamford Shelter for the Homeless and the East Harlem School.[3][39][40] Hedge Funds Care presented Vranos with its Lifetime Award for Caring in 2007.[41] He also established the Michael and Anna Vranos Graduate Fellowship Fund in the Life Sciences, the Vranos Family Junior Faculty Development Fund for Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, and the Vranos Family Graduate Research Fellowship in Developmental and Regenerative Biology, all at Harvard University. According to Harvard Alumni, "He has also offered his time and support to Harvard as a member of the FAS Task Force on Balanced Philanthropy, as chair of the Class of 1983 Gift Committee, as af member of the New York Major Gifts Committee, and as chair of the Class of 1983’s 20th and 25th reunions."[12]

Ellington was affected by the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998.[2] For a few days in mid-October, the firm sold mortgage securities to lower its funds' leverage.[20][21] The firm issued a public statement describing its borrowings to quell public fears, which was quite unusual for hedge funds at the time.[6] It clarified that although it was meeting margin calls by unloading hundreds of millions of dollars in assets over a two-day period, losses were limited.[22] One report suggests some of his hedge funds may have temporarily lost around 25% of their value as he liquidated $2 billion in assets[8] after allegedly missing a margin call from UBS.[23][24] However, from its December 1994 inception through April 2004, the firm delivered a composite annualized return of 15.4%, after fees.[7]
In 2000, Ellington bid on Laser Mortgage Management Inc., a mortgage real estate investment trust that was considering closing, but ultimately did not purchase it.[25] Various of Ellington's funds have invested in distressed mortgage-backed securities over time.[26] By 2004 his $3 billion in hedge fund assets including mortgage derivatives.[27] In October 2007, as the future credit performance of residential mortgages became increasingly uncertain, one of his funds is reported to have fallen in value by 22%[4] and to have temporarily suspended redemptions pending greater clarity around valuations.[28] As of 2007, Vranos and Ellington Management managed $5.4 billion in hedge funds and private accounts, and an additional $1.2 billion in a managed account, while also managing almost $23 billion in collateralized debt obligations.[8]
In June 2007, Vranos launched a private placement of a new entity, Ellington Financial LLC, to institutional investors.[8] The offering primarily targeted investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities. The deal was underwriten by Friedman Billings Ramsey and although originally slated for a $750 million offering,[8] evolving market conditions only allowed for a $250 million capital raise.[4] Before the private placement, a New York Times columnist noted that a portion of the private placement might be used to purchase risky tranches from bankrupt subprime lender New Century Financial Corporation and noted the potential difficulty in valuing such instruments.[8]
In October 2010, Ellington Financial LLC went public, debuting on the NYSE.[29] As of 2 January 2012[update], Vranos owned (directly or indirectly) over 2.50 million shares.[30] According to its public filings, Ellington Financial invests primarily in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, but also holds agency pools and other mortgage-related securities, and had a total return of 59% between its August 2007 inception and the end of 2011.[31] In the 2010s, Ellington opened a second office in London in order to expand into the European market.[32] Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT, chaired and founded by Vranos, went public on the NYSE after its IPO in late 2013, trading under the ticker symbol EARN.[33] In 2014 Vranos opened an office for Ellington Management in London, England.[34]

In 2001, Slate.com finance columnist Rob Walker and alternative cartoonist Josh Neufeld featured Vranos in their comic book, Titans of Finance (Alternative Comics, 2001, ISBN 1-891867-05-9).[36][37] Vranos supported both Christopher Dodd and Barack Obama on the Democratic side and Rudy Giuliani on the Republican side of the 2008 Presidential Election.[38]

Title

Michael W. "Mike" Vranos is an American hedge fund manager and philanthropist who in the 1990s was referred to by some as the "most powerful man on Wall Street."[1] In 1993, he reportedly earned $15 million from trading mortgage bonds.[2] Fortune Magazine once called him "one of the best bond traders on Wall Street."[3] According to a 2007 Wall Street Journal article, he has continued to be regarded as "the best-known mortgage-bond trader on Wall Street."[4]
Vranos headed collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) trading in the early 1990s at Kidder Peabody at a time when that firm dominated the marketplace.[3] Seizing the opportunity created by a bear market, he left to start his own firm, Ellington Management Group, in late 1994.[3] That same year, Kidder Peabody fell on troubled times and was sold to PaineWebber.[5] In spite of being affected by fall-out from the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998,[6] as of April 2004, Ellington had delivered a composite annualized return of 15.4%, after fees.[7] Ellington continues to market a variety of investment offerings.[8]

Early life and education[edit]
Vranos was born in Worcester, Massachusetts to Alexander and Aglaea Vranos, both of Greek descent.[9] He was then raised in Ellington, Connecticut, United States. In his youth, he worked as a bouncer and earned the title of Mr. Teen Connecticut as a bodybuilder.[10] He earned the nickname "The Arm".[11] Mr. Vranos earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Harvard University in 1983 with both magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa honors.[3] He began pursuing a PhD in Mathematics, before beginning his work on Wall Street.[12]
Kidder Peabody[edit]
Vranos started work at Kidder Peabody after graduation from Harvard in 1983. He was the youngest Managing Director in the 130-year history of Kidder Peabody.[3] During his reign at Kidder Peabody from 1990–1994, Kidder underwrote over $200 billion in CMOs, which was about 20% of all CMOs issued during that period and nearly double the next largest Wall Street firm.[3] Vranos was noted for having turned his collateralized mortgage obligation trading role into a money-making machine.[13] In 1991, Vranos was named Kidder Peabody’s Man of the Year. His 1992 compensation was estimated at between $10–15 million, according to the USA Today,[14] while The Washington Post reported it in the $5–7 million range.[15] By 1993 he was the highest paid employee at Kidder Peabody, and it was said that as Kidder entered financial trouble in the early 1990s that the profitability of the company was largely on Vranos' back.[16]
Kidder Peabody fell on troubled times during the bear market of 1994. Losses in the mortgage-bonds department headed by Vranos for the second quarter of 1994 were $30 million. Michael Carpenter, the CEO of Kidder from 1989 to 1994 was forced to resign in July 1994.[5][17] Then, when the number two ranking executive at the firm, Edward A. Cerullo, resigned from Kidder Peabody a few weeks later, Vranos was one of the most watched firm members.[18] During this period, Vranos was highly praised by Jack Welch, chairman of Kidder Peabody’s parent company, General Electric, for his handling of the bear market.[3] However, as market conditions grew more severe, Vranos left to start his own firm in late 1994. Kidder was ultimately sold to Paine Webber.[2]
Ellington Management Group[edit]
