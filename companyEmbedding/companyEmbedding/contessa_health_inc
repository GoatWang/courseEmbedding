Contessa Health





















Why Bundled Payments?
Health care costs continue to spiral out of control and policy-makers have finally made it a top priority to shift the majority of care into value-based payment arrangements. There are many options for value-based payment models and we strongly believe that bundled payment arrangements are the best way to eliminate waste from episodic procedures. Creating accountability for providers, alignment across the care continuum and transparency for patients will undoubtedly result in an improved care delivery system.
The health care system’s current fee-for-service approach is extremely fragmented and would never survive in any other industry.  So why does it plague the largest sector of the United States economy?  There are a myriad of reasons.  With surgeons, hospitals, anesthesiologists, physical therapists, and primary care physicians often being managed by different organizations, break-down in communication with a patient is extremely likely. This fragmentation results in an increased likelihood of duplicative testing and ultimately more cost. As patients become more responsible for paying for their health care through high-deductible health plans, they end up having to pay for that waste. To make matters worse, patients currently receive bills from all the disparate parties mentioned above. It’s no surprise that patients have no idea what the “real” cost of a procedure is when they leave their physician’s office.  Moreover, are they aware of why a procedure is being performed at a hospital instead of an outpatient surgery center?
How does it Work?
In a Contessa Health bundled payment program, the physician is responsible for the quality and cost of care a patient receives. The best way to achieve high-quality outcomes in an efficient manner is to have someone involved throughout the entire episode, managing those disconnected care providers – a care coordinator. When the decision is made to have surgery, our care coordinators are there to help the patient through the entire episode. They will be there to answer any questions the patient may have as it relates to what they are experiencing, who will be involved and where care will take place.
Furthermore, the procedure has a predetermined rate – FOR THE ENTIRE EPISODE. The patient will not be burdened by receiving multiple bills.  They will receive one bill for the entire episode of care and will have the peace of mind of knowing exactly what it will cost before deciding to move forward with surgery.





The Complexities of Bundled Payments





1. Who manages & What’s Included?

Which site is most appropriate?
What does the episode include?
How long is the episode of care?
How much should it cost?
 






2. Competing Interests
Complex ecosystems associated with traditional bundled programs result in:

High implementation costs
Difficulty with care coordination
Lack of alignment
 






3. Program Administration & Technical Infrastructure

How can we efficiently process claims?
Who arranges the providers in the program?
Who monitors the performance to ensure the highest quality care is delivered?
Which technology is really needed?

We have the administrative resources needed to launch a prospective bundled payment program, minimizing disruptions to our partners that should be focused on caring for patients.
Administrative resources include:

Defined episodes of care
Episode pricing analytics
Network arrangement
Provider contracts
Risk reinsurance

Strict eligibility requirements define which site is most suitable for the patient.
Market-based care coordinators
Contessa Coordinators are located in your market and are an integral part of the care team. Real-time, personalized, in-market intelligence is needed to effectively manage the network of ancillary providers.
Detailed post-op protocols

Outcomes and satisfaction transparency
We believe full-transparency is the key to a successful value-based care program. We provide our partners with all clinical and patient satisfaction outcomes, underscoring the belief we have in our clinical model.
