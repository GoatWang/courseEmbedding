Testimonials
What Our Customers Are Saying




We have already had over 15 athletes request sports medicine consults resulting in 45 patient visits from just one group (in the first 45 days). This instant communication, coupled with ProRehab’s immediate treatment from the physical therapist, has allowed these athletes to continue to compete at the highest level with minimal disruption to their training regimes. I highly recommend Healthy Roster.

— David Boyce, CEO, ProRehab Louisville


While using Healthy Roster to get caught up on injury documentation, I found I was able to get so much done in very short amount of time. Healthy Roster is very easy to use and time efficient, which is key for athletic trainers. The same amount of work would have taken so much longer if I was still using our previous software. We are now requiring all of our Athletic Trainers to use Healthy Roster in 2017 for injury documentation and communication.

— Julie Brough, Athletic Trainer, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center


It’s the most comprehensive health care documentation tool geared toward athletic trainers that I’ve come across.

— Aaron Goodrich, ATC, Ohio State University Sports Medicine


Healthy Roster has been a welcome addition to our Sports Medicine Facility. The app has decreased our charting time, which has made us more productive clinically. Its ease of use is fantastic.

— Eli Hallak, M.Ed., ATc, EMT, Director of Sports Medicine, St. Francis High School, CA


With the start of spring sports last week I started using Healthy Roster for my daily treatments, interactions, and evaluations. Above all else, Healthy Roster is helping me with risk management/risk reduction.  Parents have enjoyed it and have been utilizing it to talk to me where otherwise they may not have. Spring is my busiest time—hundreds of treatments administered every week—which is why I’m thankful for the “duplicate” option!

— Alex Salinas, Head Athletic Trainer at Forest Hills Northern High School


Healthy Roster provides a platform that helps us improve communication between the athlete, parents, athletic trainer, and school staff.  It also increases work efficiency and health record compliance which will improve documentation for risk and liability assessments.

— Kevin Messey, Supervising Athletic Trainer, UC San Diego Health


Healthy Roster provides “innovation in.....patient care” one of the three core focus items at OSU.This program provides OSU with a unique opportunity to provide immediate and interactive primary sports medicine care, guidance and direct medical access for athletes in our local communities.

— Richard Quincy, OSU Sports Medicine


Healthy Roster is MUCH faster than our old EMR system. I also appreciate the easy to navigate, visually appealing, less-cluttered user interface.  Finally, it’s also helpful that parents and coaches can use it to report injuries or comment on an injury status update.

— Danielle Smith, M.S., ATC Head Athletic Trainer, Maryknoll


Healthy Roster has been a great way for me, as a coach, to be on the same page as our Athletic Trainer when it comes to student athletes with injuries.  It’s allowed me to follow the progress (or lack there of) our injured athletes, especially when our schedules make it difficult to connect face-to-face.  Healthy Roster has been a very positive part of the return to play efforts for our athletes.

—  Kim Triskett, Head Basketball Coach, Grand Valley High School


I’m in charge of many sports on different fields around the community.  I may not have a chance to update a coach on a particular day because they are on a field across town.  If that happens they can easily check the athlete’s status on their app and determine the level of participation that is permitted for each athlete for that day. This helps keep everyone on the same page and mistakes in communication are decreased.

— Amy Adair MS, ATC, Head Athletic Trainer, Middle Township High School


Healthy Roster is a great resource for coaches, parents, and players.  Connecting with trained medical staff and keeping up to date on player’s injuries allows me to make sure my players don’t push themselves too much.  In addition, it enables private messaging with parents to make sure they are aware of any issues that come up at practice.

— Shane Peterson, Head Coach, Milwaukee Sting Volleyball Club


Healthy Roster provides an innovative approach that is like nothing else on the market for injury management and communication for the athletic trainer, coaches, parents and administrators. Healthy Roster is a game changer for our group!

— Adam Greenfield, President / Head Athletic Trainer, Premier Sports Medicine


We are really having a great experience using the app! It makes it very convenient to submit injury reports. Also, the status updates are simple and parents can follow the notes that we create.

— Tyler Wright, Head Athletic Trainer at Euclid High School, Lake Health


I am excited about the addition of Healthy Roster to our outreach program, as it will allow us to improve our access to our athletes and help us to prevent unneeded trips to the ER/urgent care.

— Geoff Omiatek,  Director of Therapy Services, Orthopedic ONE


In the highly competitive market of sports medicine we are always trying to find ways to differentiate our services. When we evaluated Healthy Roster we saw an innovative product that helps Heartland Orthopedic Specialists continue to be the leader in sports medicine in our region.

— Mike Doyle, Heartland Orthopedic Specialists


I think Healthy Roster is the coolest way for parents to connect with AT’s for injuries. Our lacrosse coach sent it out and it got a ton of positive email response from our parents!

— Parent in Dayton, Ohio
