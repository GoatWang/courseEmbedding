One of Eastern Bank's new rebranding campaign ads next to the Expressway in Dorchester. 



By Deirdre Fernandes
	Globe Staff 
	May 16, 2017







Eastern Bank has spun off its innovation lab’s first product and most of its core development team into an independent company, an acknowledgment that in the fast-changing financial technology market, a bank may not be the best place to grow. Numerated Growth Technologies Inc. is expected to launch Wednesday, offering software that allows banks to make quick loans to small businesses. The platform was developed at Eastern Labs, which was created three years ago.

Numerated has raised $9 million in financing, led by Venrock, the venture capital arm of the Rockefeller family, and St. Louis-based Cultivation Capital. Eastern Bank remains an investor and Florida-based FIS, which provides much of the technology used by banks, is also participating in the first round of financing, said Dan O’Malley, chief executive of Numerated. Until last month, O’Malley ran Eastern Bank’s labs. About 20 lab employees have moved to Numerated with him.

Being at Eastern, with access to its data and consumers, was essential in developing the lending platform, which allows small-business owners to get a loan under $100,000 online in about five minutes, O’Malley said. 
Eastern introduced the express loan technology in 2015, and so far four banks, including Eastern and some community banks, are using it. O’Malley hopes the technology will be in hundreds of banks within a decade. But that would require a greater infusion of capital and partnerships with other companies, such as FIS, O’Malley said.Eastern spent about $4 million on Labs last year.

When it launched in 2014, Eastern Bank officials saw the Labs as a way for the $10 billion institution to make inroads into the financial technology space, where startups are threatening traditional banking.Labs developed the new rapid loan product and recruited more tech workers to Eastern, said Bob Rivers, chief executive of Eastern Bank. “It was great for our brand,” he said. “Do we think we can replicate it? Sure. Would we replicate it in the same way? I don’t know.”Eastern officials are still working on the next version of Labs, which the bank plans to continue, under new leadership and with a new focus. Spinning off Numerated may have been the best way for Eastern to recoup its technology investment and allow the platform to grow, said Dave Kucera, a venture partner at Fintech Forge, which brings banks together with technology partners. Banks, which are risk-averse and compliance-focused, have struggled to keep pace with innovation. And their internal investments in technology haven’t necessarily yielded game-changing results, such as the online payments system PayPal, which made online shopping simpler, he said. 
Financial institutions thought it would be easier to innovate, Kucera said. “And they’re realizing it’s much harder to do.”Deirdre Fernandes can be reached at deirdre.fernandes@globe.com. Follow her on Twitter @fernandesglobe.

Eastern Bank is the largest independent, mutually owned bank in New England and the largest community bank in Massachusetts.[3][4] With 82 branches, Eastern had a 2.83% market share in Massachusetts in 2009.[5] It was founded in 1818 in Salem, and then moved to Lynn, Massachusetts. The company began an aggressive expansion campaign near the end of the 1990s and moved its headquarters to Boston's Financial District.
History[edit]
Eastern Bank was established on April 15, 1818 as Salem Savings Bank and became insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on October 1, 1983.[6] On October 19, 1989, Eastern Savings Bank's parent company Lynn, Massachusetts-based Eastern Bank Corporation, renamed it Eastern Bank, and reorganized it into a mutual holding company, making it the first of its kind in Massachusetts.[6][7]
In the years following its reorganization, it made several acquisitions of local banks. They included Shore Bank And Trust Company (Lynn, April 1992), Malden Trust Company (Malden, May 1992), First Colonial Bank For Savings (Lynn, October 1993), and Saugus Bank And Trust Company (Saugus, November 1994).[6]




Former MassBank location in Downtown Melrose. Divested after temporary rebranding.


In 1997, Eastern began an aggressive expansion program with the aim of doubling its size within five years.[8] The first acquisition of the program was initiated in early 1998 when Eastern bought the ten-branch Quincy-based Hibernia Savings Bank and its parent holding company Emerald Isle Bancorp, Inc for $80 million and converted all branches to Eastern Banks.[7][9] Eastern, with the bulk of its branches north of Boston, gained exposure to the market south of Boston through the acquisition.
In November 2002, Eastern Bank merged its operations with its subsidiary, Salem-based Eastern Bank & Trust Company.[6] The following year in March 2003, company headquarters were moved from Lynn to Boston's Financial District, positioning it alongside the regional headquarters of other large banks including FleetBoston Financial and Citizens Bank.[6][8]
Continually expanding its footprint in the region, Eastern purchased Wareham's Plymouth Savings Bank in May 2005 and Sharon Co-operative Bank in May 2007. Eastern Bank announced in March 2008 its intention to buy Reading-based MassBank Corp. for $170 million.[3][10] Eastern's third acquisition in four years, it doubled its deposits in Middlesex County to more than $1.4 billion, garnering a 4% market share in the county.[10] In late June 2010, it was announced that Eastern Bank was the winning bidder to acquire independent Massachusetts bank Wainwright and its 12 branches located in Boston and the surrounding communities. The bank, "known for its social activism and lending to nonprofit organizations", was purchased for $163 million or $19 a share; almost double its $9.62 closing stock price prior to the announcement.[11]

Eastern Bank is the largest independent, mutually owned bank in New England and the largest community bank in Massachusetts.[3][4] With 82 branches, Eastern had a 2.83% market share in Massachusetts in 2009.[5] It was founded in 1818 in Salem, and then moved to Lynn, Massachusetts. The company began an aggressive expansion campaign near the end of the 1990s and moved its headquarters to Boston's Financial District.
History[edit]
Eastern Bank was established on April 15, 1818 as Salem Savings Bank and became insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on October 1, 1983.[6] On October 19, 1989, Eastern Savings Bank's parent company Lynn, Massachusetts-based Eastern Bank Corporation, renamed it Eastern Bank, and reorganized it into a mutual holding company, making it the first of its kind in Massachusetts.[6][7]
In the years following its reorganization, it made several acquisitions of local banks. They included Shore Bank And Trust Company (Lynn, April 1992), Malden Trust Company (Malden, May 1992), First Colonial Bank For Savings (Lynn, October 1993), and Saugus Bank And Trust Company (Saugus, November 1994).[6]




Former MassBank location in Downtown Melrose. Divested after temporary rebranding.


In 1997, Eastern began an aggressive expansion program with the aim of doubling its size within five years.[8] The first acquisition of the program was initiated in early 1998 when Eastern bought the ten-branch Quincy-based Hibernia Savings Bank and its parent holding company Emerald Isle Bancorp, Inc for $80 million and converted all branches to Eastern Banks.[7][9] Eastern, with the bulk of its branches north of Boston, gained exposure to the market south of Boston through the acquisition.
In November 2002, Eastern Bank merged its operations with its subsidiary, Salem-based Eastern Bank & Trust Company.[6] The following year in March 2003, company headquarters were moved from Lynn to Boston's Financial District, positioning it alongside the regional headquarters of other large banks including FleetBoston Financial and Citizens Bank.[6][8]
Continually expanding its footprint in the region, Eastern purchased Wareham's Plymouth Savings Bank in May 2005 and Sharon Co-operative Bank in May 2007. Eastern Bank announced in March 2008 its intention to buy Reading-based MassBank Corp. for $170 million.[3][10] Eastern's third acquisition in four years, it doubled its deposits in Middlesex County to more than $1.4 billion, garnering a 4% market share in the county.[10] In late June 2010, it was announced that Eastern Bank was the winning bidder to acquire independent Massachusetts bank Wainwright and its 12 branches located in Boston and the surrounding communities. The bank, "known for its social activism and lending to nonprofit organizations", was purchased for $163 million or $19 a share; almost double its $9.62 closing stock price prior to the announcement.[11]
