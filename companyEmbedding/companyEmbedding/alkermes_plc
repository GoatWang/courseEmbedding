ARISTADA®


You are now entering the U.S. Products page. This page is intended for the U.S. audience only.
    






ARISTADA® (aripiprazole lauroxil) extended-release injectable suspension is a long-acting atypical antipsychotic that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ARISTADA is available in four dose strengths with once-monthly dosing (441 mg, 662 mg, 882 mg), a six-week dosing option (882 mg) and a two-month dosing option (1064 mg).
For more information, visit www.aristada.com.

INDICATION and IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION for ARISTADA® (aripiprazole lauroxil) extended-release injectable suspension, for intramuscular use
INDICATION
ARISTADA is a prescription medicine given by injection by a healthcare professional and used to treat schizophrenia. It is not known if ARISTADA is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Elderly people with dementia-related psychosis are at increased risk of death when treated with antipsychotic medicines including ARISTADA. ARISTADA is not for the treatment of people who have lost touch with reality (psychosis) due to confusion and memory loss (dementia).

             
Contraindication: Do not receive ARISTADA if you are allergic to aripiprazole or any of the ingredients in ARISTADA. Allergic reactions to aripiprazole have ranged from rash, hives and itching to anaphylaxis, which may include difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest, and swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue.
ARISTADA may cause serious side effects including:

Stroke (cerebrovascular problems) in elderly people that can lead to death.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) a rare and serious condition that can lead to death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have some or all of the following symptoms of NMS:
                        
high fever,
stiff muscles,
confusion,
sweating,
changes in pulse, heart rate, and blood pressure.


Uncontrolled body movements (tardive dyskinesia). ARISTADA may cause movements that you cannot control in your face, tongue, or other body parts. Tardive dyskinesia may not go away, even if you stop receiving ARISTADA. Tardive dyskinesia may also start after you stop receiving ARISTADA.

Problems with your metabolism such as: 


High blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Increases in blood sugar can happen in some people who receive ARISTADA. Extremely high blood sugar can lead to coma or death. If you have diabetes or risk factors for diabetes (such as being overweight or a family history of diabetes), your healthcare provider should check your blood sugar before you start receiving ARISTADA and during your treatment.
                            

Call your healthcare provider if you have any of these symptoms of high blood sugar while receiving ARISTADA:

feel very thirsty
need to urinate more than usual
feel very hungry
feel weak or tired
feel sick to your stomach
feel confused, or your breath smells fruity




Increased fat levels (cholesterol and triglycerides) in your blood
Weight gain. You and your healthcare provider should check your weight regularly.

Gambling urges and other uncontrollable (compulsive) behaviors. There is the possibility that you may have strong urges to gamble, shop, have sex, binge eat or have other uncontrollable strong urges.  If you or your family members notice that you are having uncontrollable urges, talk to your healthcare provider.
Decreased blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension). You may feel lightheaded or faint when you rise too quickly from a sitting or lying position.
Falls. Because antipsychotic medicines like ARISTADA may cause drowsiness or dizziness when standing, you may be at risk for falls and related injuries.Low white blood cell count
Seizures (convulsions)
Problems controlling your body temperature so that you feel too warm. Do not become too hot or dehydrated while you receive ARISTADA. Do not exercise too much. In hot weather, stay inside in a cool place if possible. Stay out of the sun. Do not wear too much clothing or heavy clothing. Drink plenty of water.
Difficulty swallowing

The most common side effect of ARISTADA includes feeling like you need to move to stop unpleasant feelings in your legs (restless leg syndrome or akathisia). These are not all the possible side effects of ARISTADA. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.
Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how ARISTADA affects you. ARISTADA may make you feel drowsy.
Do not drink alcohol while you receive ARISTADA.
Before receiving ARISTADA tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have never taken Abilify®, Abilify Maintena®, or any aripiprazole product before
have diabetes or high blood sugar or a family history of diabetes or high blood sugar. Your healthcare provider should check your blood sugar before you start receiving ARISTADA and during your treatment.
have or had seizures (convulsions)
have or had low or high blood pressure
have or had heart problems or a stroke
have or had a low white blood cell count
have problems that may affect you receiving an injection in your buttocks or your arm
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if ARISTADA will harm your unborn baby. If you become pregnant while taking ARISTADA, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics. You can register by calling 1-866-961-2388, or visit http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. ARISTADA can pass into your breast milk. It is not known if it may harm your baby. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you receive ARISTADA.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. ARISTADA and other medicines may affect each other causing possible serious side effects. Do not start or stop any medicines while receiving ARISTADA without talking to your healthcare provider first.
If you have any questions about your health or medicines, talk to your healthcare provider. You are encouraged to report all side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

VIVITROL®



        You are now entering the U.S. Products page. This page is intended for the U.S. audience only.
    







VIVITROL® (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is a once-monthly medication for the treatment of alcohol dependence as well as for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification.
VIVITROL is the first and only non-narcotic, non-addictive, once-monthly medication approved for the treatment of opioid dependence. Treatment with VIVITROL should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support.
For more information, visit www.vivitrol.com.

Important Safety Information for VIVITROL® (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension)
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WHAT IS VIVITROL®?
VIVITROL (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is a prescription injectable medicine used to:

Treat alcohol dependence. You should stop drinking before starting VIVITROL.
Prevent relapse to opioid dependence after opioid detox. You must stop taking opioids or other opioid-containing medications before starting VIVITROL.

VIVITROL must be used with other alcohol or drug recovery programs such as counseling.
VIVITROL may not work for everyone and has not been studied in children.
DO NOT TAKE VIVITROL IF YOU:

Are still using or still have any symptoms of physical withdrawal due to dependence on opioid street drugs or opioid-containing medicines.
Have opioid withdrawal symptoms.
Are allergic to naltrexone or any of the ingredients in VIVITROL or the liquid used to mix VIVITROL.

See the Medication Guide for more information about opioid withdrawal and the ingredients in VIVITROL and the liquid used to mix it.
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT VIVITROL?
VIVITROL can cause serious side effects, including:
RISK OF OPIOID OVERDOSE
Using opioids, even in amounts that you used before VIVITROL treatment, can lead to accidental overdose, serious injury, coma, or death. To avoid accidental overdose:

Do not take large amounts of opioids or try to overcome the opioid-blocking effects of VIVITROL.
Do not use opioids in amounts that you used before VIVITROL treatment. You may even be more sensitive to lower amounts of opioids:
                    
After detox
When your next VIVITROL dose is due.
If you miss a dose of VIVITROL.
After you stop VIVITROL treatment.



Get emergency medical help right away if you have trouble breathing; become very drowsy with slowed breathing; have slow, shallow breathing; feel faint, dizzy, confused; or have other unusual symptoms.
SEVERE REACTIONS AT THE INJECTION SITE
VIVITROL may cause severe injection site reactions, including tissue death. Some injection site reactions have required surgery. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of the following at your injection site:

Intense pain
The area feels hard
Swelling
Lumps
Blisters
An open wound
A dark scab

Tell your doctor about any injection site reaction that concerns you, gets worse overtime or does not get better by two weeks after the injection.
SUDDEN OPIOID WITHDRAWAL
To avoid sudden opioid withdrawal, you must stop taking any opioids or opioid-containing medications, including buprenorphine or methadone, for at least 7 to 14 days before starting VIVITROL. If your doctor decides that you don’t need to complete detox first, he or she may give you VIVITROL in a medical facility that can treat sudden opioid withdrawal.
Sudden opioid withdrawal can be severe and may require hospitalization.
LIVER DAMAGE OR HEPATITIS
Naltrexone, the active ingredient in VIVITROL, can cause liver damage or hepatitis. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms of liver problems during VIVITROL treatment:

Stomach area pain lasting more than a few days
Yellowing of the whites of your eyes
Dark urine
Tiredness

OTHER POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
VIVITROL can cause other serious side effects, such as:

Depressed mood – Sometimes this leads to suicide or suicidal thoughts and behavior. Tell those closest to you that you are taking VIVITROL. You or those closest to you should call your doctor right away if you become depressed or have any new or worsening depression symptoms.
Allergic pneumonia – Tell your healthcare provider if you have shortness of breath, wheezing, or a cough that doesn’t go away.
Serious allergic reactions – Get medical help immediately if you have a skin rash; swelling of your face, eyes, mouth, or tongue; trouble breathing or wheezing; chest pain; or are feeling dizzy or faint.

Common side effects of VIVITROL include nausea, tiredness, headache, dizziness, vomiting, decreased appetite, painful joints, and muscle cramps; in addition, common side effects in people taking VIVITROL for opioid dependence also include cold symptoms, trouble sleeping, and toothache.
These are not all of the side effects of VIVITROL. For more information, ask your healthcare provider. Tell your doctor right away if you have any side effect that does not go away. See the attached Medication Guide for more information.
Call your doctor for medical advice about any side effects. You are encouraged to report negative side effects to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

Alkermes plc is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The company is the result of a merger in September 2011 between Alkermes, Inc., and Elan Drug Technologies (EDT), the former drug formulation and manufacturing division of Élan Corporation, plc.[3] The company is headquartered in Dublin, and has an R&D center in Waltham, Massachusetts, and manufacturing facilities in Athlone, Ireland, and Wilmington, Ohio.[1]
Products[edit]
Alkermes has more than 20 commercial drug products and candidates that address serious and chronic diseases, such as addiction, schizophrenia, diabetes and depression. Among these products, five are primary to the company: risperidone long-acting Injection (generic for Risperdal Consta) for schizophrenia and bipolar 1 disorder,[4][5] paliperidone palmitate (generic for Invega Sustenna in the U.S., Xeplion in Europe) for schizophrenia,[6][7] 4-aminopyridine (generic for Ampyra in the U.S., Fampyra in Europe) to improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis,[8][9] naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension (generic for Vivitrol) for alcohol and opioid dependence,[10][11] and exenatide extended-release for injectable suspension (generic for Bydureon) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Bydureon is a once-weekly, extended-release form of the drug, exenatide (Byetta), and was developed through a partnership between Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Alkermes and Eli Lilly. It is approved in Europe and the U.S.[12]
ALKS-5461, a κ-opioid receptor antagonist, is a next-generation, novel antidepressant which is under development by Alkermes for treatment-resistant depression.[13]

We will compare the two companies on revenue growth, earnings, revenue per employee, operating margins, free cash flow and valuation. The head to head compare assigns 100 points in total. 
				


				Before we dive into the analysis, we will look at the stock returns for each company over the last three months, six months and the last year. The stock returns do not impact the head to head compare scores which are focused on the fundamentals of each company, but ultimately stock returns are are still a critical piece to a full analysis and compare.

 China Biologic Products Inc has a substantially higher fundamental rating then Alkermes plc which has an impact on the head-to-head comparison. The CML Star Rating is an objective, quantifiable measure of a company's operating and financial condition. 
		The rating is computed by measuring numerous elements of the company's current financial data and their associated changes over time.
		
		Now, let's dive into the two companies to compare them.






➤ Income Statement
First we turn to the income statement and compare revenue, earnings and revenue per employee for both companies. We note that simple revenue comparisons 
								do not impact the rating.
								
↪ Alkermes plc has substantially higher revenue in the last year than China Biologic Products Inc 
						although both companies are still relatively small. Raw revenue comps do not affect the head to head rating.Revenue↪ CBPO is showing a profit while ALKS has negative earnings over the last year.Net Income↪ ALKS generates massively larger revenue per employee ($426,000) than CBPO ($178,000).Revenue per Employee
			 ($ Millions)




➤ Margins
Next we create some derived metrics to compare the the amount of revenue earned per dollar of expense and the amount of free cash flow earned per dollar of revenue. Margins are one of the fairest ways to compare companies since they remove some of the bias of large versus small numbers.
								
↪ China Biologic Products Inc generates $1.85 in revenue for every $1 of expense, while Alkermes plc generates an operating loss with just $0.90 in revenue per $1 of expense.Revenue per Dollar of Expense↪ CBPO generates $0.04 in levered free cash flow for every $1 of revenue, 
					while ALKS generates a cash flow loss of $-0.04  per $1 of revenue.Free Cash Flow
		per Dollar of Revenue




➤ Growth
Finally we compare the financial metrics related to growth: revenue growth rates and price to sales.
								
↪ Both companies are growing revenue. Alkermes plc is growing revenue faster than China Biologic Products Inc but not by a notable amount.Revenue Growth↪  For every $1 in revenue, the stock market prices in $11.09 in market cap for ALKS and $8.89 in market cap for CBPO.Price to Sales

It utilizes its LinkeRx technology. It is a prodrug; once in the body, it is converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, which is then hydrolyzed to aripiprazole. It is the antipsychotic with once-monthly and six-week dosing options to deliver and maintain therapeutic levels of medication in the body. It has three dosing options: 441 milligrams (mg), 662 mg and 882 mg and is packaged in a pre-filled product format. It develops, manufactures and commercializes it in the United States.VIVITROL is a once monthly, non-addictive and injectable medication for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. It uses its polymer based microsphere injectable extended release technology to deliver and maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through one intramuscular injection every four weeks. It develops, manufactures and commercializes VIVITROL in the United States, Russia and other countries.INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA and RISPERDAL CONSTA are antipsychotics. INVEGA SUSTENNA is for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder as either a monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION extended-release injectable suspension is for the treatment of schizophrenia and is marketed and sold under the trade name, XEPLION. INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION uses its nanoparticle injectable extended-release technology to increase the rate of dissolution and enable the formulation of an aqueous suspension for once-monthly intramuscular administration.INVEGA TRINZA is an antipsychotic injection for the treatment of schizophrenia used in people treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA. INVEGA TRINZA is the schizophrenia treatment to be taken once every three months. TREVICTA is used for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients clinically stable on XEPLION. RISPERDAL CONSTA is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and as both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. It uses its polymer-based microsphere injectable extended-release technology to deliver and maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through just one intramuscular injection every two weeks.AMPYRA (dalfampridine)/FAMPYRA (fampridine) is the treatment approved across Europe, Asia and the Americas to develop walking in adults with MS having walking disability. Extended-release dalfampridine tablets are marketed and sold by Acorda in the United States under the trade name AMPYRA and by Biogen MA Inc. outside the United States under the trade name FAMPYRA. BYDUREON (exenatide extended-release for injectable suspension) is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. BYDUREON, a once-weekly formulation of exenatide, uses its polymer-based microsphere injectable extended-release technology. BYDUREON Pen 2 mg, a pre-filled, single use pen injector that contains the same formulation and dose as the original BYDUREON single dose tray, is available in the United States, certain countries in the European Union and Japan.Aripiprazole lauroxil, which is an intramuscular injectable antipsychotic available as ARISTADA, with once monthly and six-week dosing options, for the treatment of schizophrenia, is in development with a two-month dosing interval. ALKS 5461 is a once-daily, oral sublingual investigational medicine, with a mechanism of action, in development for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients with a response to standard antidepressant therapies. ALKS 5461 consists of samidorphan in combination with buprenorphine.ALKS 3831 is an oral investigational medicine designed as an antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia. ALKS 3831 consists of samidorphan in combination with the established antipsychotic drug olanzapine, which is available under the name ZYPREXA. ALKS 3831 is designed to provide the ability of olanzapine and a differentiated safety profile from olanzapine with weight and metabolic properties and to have utility in the treatment of schizophrenia in patients with co-occurring alcohol use disorder. ALKS 8700 is an oral investigational monomethyl fumarate (MMF) molecule in development for the treatment of MS.ALKS 6428 is designed to enable healthcare providers' transition patients from physical dependence on opioids to initiation with VIVITROL. ALKS 6428 is an investigational regimen of ascending doses of oral naltrexone administered in conjunction with ancillary medications during a seven-day treatment period, prior to first VIVITROL injection. ALKS 4230 is its selective effector cell activator (SECA) that is designed to harness a patient's immune system to activate and increase the number of tumor killing immune cells. SECA proteins target immune cells to avoid expansion of immune regulatory cells, which interfere with the anti-tumor response. SECA molecules are engineered using its fusion protein technology platform to modulate the natural mechanism of action of a biologic product. ALKS 7119 is an oral investigational medicine that has a multivalent mechanism of action that acts on receptors in the brain involved in several CNS diseases, including agitation in Alzheimer's disease, MDD and others.The injectable extended release microsphere technology allows to encapsulate small molecule pharmaceuticals, peptides and proteins in microspheres made of common medical polymers. The technology is designed to enable formulations of pharmaceuticals by providing controlled, extended release of drugs over time. The LinkeRx technology platform is designed to enable the creation of extended release injectable versions of antipsychotic therapies and are also useful in other disease areas in, which extended duration of action provides therapeutic benefits. The technology uses linker tail chemistry to create new molecular entities derived from known agents.The NanoCrystal technology is applicable to water soluble compounds and involves formulating and stabilizing drugs into particles that are nanometers in size. A drug in NanoCrystal form can be incorporated into a range of common dosage forms and administration routes, including tablets, capsules, inhalation devices and sterile forms for injection. Its OCR technologies are used to formulate, develop and manufacture oral dosage forms of pharmaceutical products that control the release characteristics of standard dosage forms. Its OCR platform includes technologies for pharmacokinetic profiles, including Spheroidal Oral Drug Absorption System (SODAS) technology, Chronotherapeutic Oral Drug Absorption System (CODAS) technology, Intestinal Protective Drug Absorption System (IPDAS) technology and the Matrix Drug Absorption System (MXDAS) drug absorption system.SODAS technology involves producing spherical beads of 1 millimeter (mm) to 2 mm in diameter containing drug plus excipients and coated with product specific modified release polymers. CODAS technology enables the delayed onset of drug release incorporating the use of specific polymers, resulting in a drug release profile that complements circadian patterns. IPDAS technology conveys gastrointestinal protection by a dispersion of drug in a manner, through the use of controlled release beads compressed into a tablet form. MXDAS technology formulates the drug in a hydrophilic matrix and incorporates one or more hydrophilic matrix forming polymers into a solid oral dosage form, which controls the release of drug through a process of diffusion and erosion in the gastrointestinal tract.The Company competes with Eli Lilly & Company, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Indivior plc, BioDelivery Sciences, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, Orexo US, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S, Biogen MA Inc., Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, EMD Serono, Inc., Novartis AG, and Sanofi Aventis.

Alkermes plc is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The company is the result of a merger in September 2011 between Alkermes, Inc., and Elan Drug Technologies (EDT), the former drug formulation and manufacturing division of Élan Corporation, plc.[3] The company is headquartered in Dublin, and has an R&D center in Waltham, Massachusetts, and manufacturing facilities in Athlone, Ireland, and Wilmington, Ohio.[1]
Products[edit]
Alkermes has more than 20 commercial drug products and candidates that address serious and chronic diseases, such as addiction, schizophrenia, diabetes and depression. Among these products, five are primary to the company: risperidone long-acting Injection (generic for Risperdal Consta) for schizophrenia and bipolar 1 disorder,[4][5] paliperidone palmitate (generic for Invega Sustenna in the U.S., Xeplion in Europe) for schizophrenia,[6][7] 4-aminopyridine (generic for Ampyra in the U.S., Fampyra in Europe) to improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis,[8][9] naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension (generic for Vivitrol) for alcohol and opioid dependence,[10][11] and exenatide extended-release for injectable suspension (generic for Bydureon) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Bydureon is a once-weekly, extended-release form of the drug, exenatide (Byetta), and was developed through a partnership between Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Alkermes and Eli Lilly. It is approved in Europe and the U.S.[12]
ALKS-5461, a κ-opioid receptor antagonist, is a next-generation, novel antidepressant which is under development by Alkermes for treatment-resistant depression.[13]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
