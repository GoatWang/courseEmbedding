("Ubiquiti"), a developer of networking technology for service providers and enterprises. Mr. Ocampo also serves as a director of various privately-held companies. Mr. Ocampo holds a B.S.E.E. from Santa Clara University. Mr. Ocampo's strategic vision, developed over more than 30 years successfully leading public and private companies in the RF semiconductor and component industry, is a unique asset to our board of directors. His engineering background and extensive knowledge of our operations, markets and technology provides our board of directors with important insights. We also believe that having our largest stockholder (together with Mrs. Ocampo and their affiliates) on the board of directors assists the board in making decisions aimed at increasing stockholder value over the long term.

The 100 Highest Rollers

Clint Willis,
					            04.02.01











STILL DOING WELL...ON SECOND THOUGHT, HOLD THE FINE CORINTHIAN LEATHER










ou think you had a bad year? Consider the case of Toby Lenk. Some 19 months ago this guy's stake in online toy�seller eToys made him worth $325.8 million�landing him in the 69th spot on our list of technology's 100 richest. At the end of January, Lenk owned stock worth $500,000, not even enough to buy an apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side.


And how about Bill Gates? Last year, his $92.7 billion fortune put him on top of our list and gave him an $80.3 billion lead over Oracle's founder, Larry Ellison. Gates is still in first place, even though $38.3 billion was hacked off his fortune. But now, he's only $12.3 billion ahead of his nemesis, Ellison, on our list. The Oracle founder's decision to switch from client/server computing to an Internet�based model helped boost his fortune by some $29.6 billion, to $42.1 billion, since our last list in November 1999. 





Pure Internet moguls were not so fortunate. The hottest Internet stocks of 1999 were hammered in 2000. For all those formerly rich CMGI stockholders with pennies jiggling in their piggy banks, there's good news: You're not alone. CMGI's David Wetherell was knocked off his perch as the 22nd richest last year to 79th this year, having lost 84% of his wealth. Despite the best efforts of ubiquitous ham William Shatner, who cashed out about 25% of his stock before the fall, Priceline's Jay Walker sank from 11th to 91st; at last count he was worth $190 million. Time magazine's former Man of the Year, the preternaturally optimistic Jeff Bezos, fell from seventh with $7.3 billion, to 16th this year, with $2.3 billion. Search engine software was hit hard along with portals; thus, Inktomi put three guys on the list in 1999 and none this time around (Chief Scientist Eric Brewer saw his fortune slip from $460 million to $80 million).


That said, stocks of companies that build and maintain the Internet's infrastructure held up surprisingly well�and some even delivered gains. Networking companies such as Sycamore, Broadcom, and Juniper made their richest shareholders much richer.


Software and hardware companies also held up well. When Handspring, founded by the inventors of the PalmPilot, went public this year, all three cofounders made the top 100. And Rich List veteran Sanjiv Sidhu from i2 Technologies is worth $6.8 billion, up 583% from less than a billion dollars last year.


This list includes a total of 33 billionaires (compared to 30 the previous year), 12 of them new ones. Still, the total wealth this year was $25.9 billion less than last time around. But get this: Subtract Microsoft's three richest and the rest of the list is richer than last year's also�rans.


It actually was a little tougher to get on the list this year as well. The last spot belongs to Susan Orr, a former director of Hewlett�Packard, with $182.9 million. A year ago, No. 100, Steve Kirsch of Infoseek, needed just $167.4 million to make the cut. The 30th spot on this year's list cost $1.37 billion and belongs to Vincent Smith from Quest Software; last year that spot was claimed by Apple's Steve Jobs with $1.02 billion. (Jobs has $1.38 billion this time around, which gets him the No. 29 spot.)


After last year's stumble, it's easy to forget that the technology sector has created enormous amounts of wealth in recent years. So we should note that, while the $256.6 billion total wealth of our 100 richest doesn't quite measure up to the 1999 figure, it far surpasses the $152.9 billion figure of two years ago and the $108.6 billion of three years ago. Turns out that the old saying is mostly right: The rich, as a group at least, may not always get richer. But their tendency to accumulate wealth even in tough times is awfully impressive. And if that isn't an old saying, well then, it should be.


Methodology: Values calculated using closing stock prices as of January 30, 2001. Holdings taken from most recent proxies filed with SEC. Includes only shares and options beneficially owned as defined by the SEC.

It wasn't just the court order to break up the company that caused Microsoft stock to sink last year. Gates' monopoly has had less�than�stunning Internet initiatives, and then there's the slowdown in PC sales. Still, he's got more than a little spare change. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded nearly $1.5 billion in 2000, mainly to combat disease in the Third World and improve education in the U.S.

Gordon Moore, 71Cofounder, DirectorIntel, Santa Clara, CA354.7M/$13.24B   SEMI Intel's cofounder spent much of the past year giving his money away. He donated $12.5 million to SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Then, using $5 billion of his Intel stock, he created the nation's seventh�largest charitable foundation, the Gordon E. and Betty I. Moore Foundation, to fund scientific research, education, and environment preservation.

The king of the direct sales model suffered a $12.7 billion loss to his net worth last year as Dell stock sank 67%. But consider this: Dell now heads up the world's leading maker of desktop PCs, business notebooks, and workstations, and the No. 2 producer of servers. Not too shabby for the still�boyish billionaire who started with a measly $1,000 back in '84.

The wealthiest Indian immigrant in America has said that growing up in chaotic India helped prepare him for the turbulent Internet business. Indeed, he orchestrated i2's $9.3 billion merger with Aspect Development last year, the biggest software deal ever.

The pair met at TRW in 1981. Now they head up Broadcom, a leading supplier of chips for cable modems, set�top boxes, and DSL. The firm posted 172% earnings growth in 2000, thanks largely to Nicholas' hard�charging management.

Witness the stock's more than 50% decline�and Omidyar's $6.5 billion loss. No doubt Omidyar is consoling himself from his home in Paris, where he's working on eBay's overseas expansion.

Ted Waitt, 38Chairman, CEOGateway, San Diego, CA115.6M/$3.23B   CH Since picking up stakes and moving to California, the computer maker has seen its revenue growth slow, even losing money during the past holiday season. At the end of January, Waitt took back the company's reins as CEO. Former CEO Jeff Weitzen, who first suggested that Gateway make the move west, lasted a little more than a year. Waitt replaced much of the executive team with old execs from the days in North Sioux City, South Dakota.

Richard & Maureen Egan, 64/63Founder/DirectorEMC, Hopkinton, MA26.2M/$3.04B   PER  The Egans' recent move to sell cheaper storage puts EMC head�to�head with the darling of the low�end storage space, Network Appliance. While this should keep EMC's growth strong, it's likely to squeeze margins going forward. That's one reason why the stock is down more than 30% since late September. Still, it's foolish to bet against Richard, an ex�Marine who helped build the Apollo Guidance Computer and currently sits on George W. Bush's Technology Council.

Jeff Bezos, 36Chairman, CEOAmazon.com, Seattle, WA117.5M/$2.28B   INT In 2000 Jeff Bezos endured by far the worst year since he founded Amazon.com in 1995. Analysts predicted the company could run out of cash in 2001; company President Joseph Galli left for VerticalNet; and the stock dropped 79%, costing Bezos $7.1 billion. But nothing seems to dampen his ebullient optimism. Bezos writes off speculation about Amazon running out of cash as "pure hogwash."

Not bad, eh? Lately, Skoll has cut back, devoting more time to philanthropy: He has donated $50 million to a Silicon Valley foundation and $7.5 million to the University of Toronto, and is backing a new program to encourage Canadian tech entrepreneurs. Oh, and he finally replaced his '89 Mazda RX�7 with a new car�but only because the Mazda broke down.

Yang, a big Paul McCartney fan, maybe was amazed as Yahoo's stock price sank more than 85% last year. But the loss probably doesn't matter much to him. He always claimed not to care about the money. Besides, even after losing $2 billion in a year, his fortune still is greater than the GDPs of many countries.

The dutiful first son started Amkor as the U.S. marketing arm of Anam, his father's Korean�based semiconductor firm. By 1998 Amkor was the world's leading independent chipmaker. Kim's net worth took a $3.6 billion tumble last year thanks to the PC slowdown, but he has been through hard times before: When the company struggled to meet payroll in the '70s, Kim's wife, Agnes, helped raise cash by selling calculators and radios from a mall kiosk�which eventually became Electronics Boutique, a worldwide electronics firm.

View, CA14.2M/$1.66B   NET Kriens is among a lucky few folks in the technology sector to have gotten much, much richer last year: His fortune is up 157%. The reason: Juniper keeps killing Cisco with its high�end routers, which sell for around $400,000 a pop. The firm's technology is six to nine months ahead of its bigger rival's, helping Juniper grab 30% of the market just two years after it began shipping products. Kriens' fortune, though, hiccuped at the end of the year, as Juniper shares fell 48% from their $244.50 October peak, due to investor worries about slumping demand for its products.
