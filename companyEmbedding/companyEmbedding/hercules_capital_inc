Hercules Capital: Fear Discount Likely To Persist Over The Short Haul - Hercules Capital, Inc. (NASDAQ:HTGC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Hercules Capital: Fear Discount Likely To Persist Over The Short HaulJul.10.17 | About: Hercules Capital, (HTGC) Achilles Research Long/short equity, special situationsSummaryHercules Capital’s management was seeking management externalization in May.However, the BDC has withdrawn its proposal of a new investment advisor relationship.HTGC has not yet recovered much, suggesting that a lot of uncertainty still weighs on the BDC’s shares.Positive asset sensitivity and potential for NII growth in higher interest rate environment biggest reason to buy into the BDC.An investment in HTGC yields 9.34 percent.Hercules Capital, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HTGC) management upset shareholders in May when it announced that it would hold a special meeting for investors to approve a new management and compensation structure. Shareholders didn’t like the idea of an externalized management and dumped its shares. Uncertainty is likely going to continue to weigh on Hercules Capital’s shares over the short haul. However, if management decides to stick with an internal management structure, shares could edge higher. Fear Discount Likely To Persist Over The Short Haul Hercules Capital said in early May that it would seek to externalize management for "strategic reasons". According to management, externalization would allow the company to "broaden the size and categories of assets under its future management". Seasoned BDC investors, however, know what this means: A change in compensation structure would likely imply higher management fees, which in turn would create an incentive problem. Management’s primary motivation would be to increase the size of assets under management in order to earn incentive fees rather than focus on maximizing shareholder value. In fact, internally-managed investment companies have better reputations in the stock market largely because of their superior incentive structures compared to externally-managed investment companies whose management can siphon off a lot of cash at the expense of shareholders. Prospect Capital’s (NASDAQ:PSEC) shares, for instance, sold for a large discount to Net Asset Value for a long time primarily because of its high management fees.
 Two weeks after the initial announcement, however, Hercules Capital postponed the Special Meeting of Stockholders previously scheduled for June 29, 2017, after shareholders voiced their dissatisfaction with the new management and compensation structure. However, the damage had already been done. Hercules Capital’s shares were obliterated in early May, and shares have yet to meaningfully recover from the sell-off. 

 Source: StockCharts.com Hercules Capital’s shares have stabilized after the sell-off, but will likely continue to trade sideways in my opinion until shareholders gain some more clarity as to whether the company will follow the externalization route or not. Should Hercules Capital decide to follow through with externalizing its management, I would expect the share price to drop further as investors disapprove of an unfavorable compensation agreement. On the other hand, shares appear to have bottomed out for now, and could edge higher if management commits to an internal management structure. In any case, I have closed my long position in Hercules Capital because of the company’s request for a Special Stockholder Meeting in May. What About The Positives? Hercules Capital has seen strong growth in the last six years, with Total/Net Investment Income reaching new highs nearly every year as smaller BDCs took market share from bigger banks that cut back on lending to higher risk clients. 


 Source: Hercules Capital That being said, the biggest justification for buying Hercules Capital today relates to the BDC’s highly rate-sensitive loan portfolio. In short, the higher the short-term interest rates climb, the stronger the NII tailwinds for Hercules Capital are going to be. The Federal Reserve has hiked rates three times in the last seven months. Each 25 bps rate hike is expected to lift Hercules Capital’s Net Interest Income $0.03/share each year. In other words, the more aggressive the Fed is about its rate policy, the better the odds are for continued NII growth and, potentially, a dividend hike. 

 Source: Hercules Capital Your Takeaway I had a lot of confidence in Hercules Capital and its operating results before the company unnecessarily injected a mountain of uncertainty into the investment by proposing a management structure that is and will not be in the best interest of shareholders. However, management has withdrawn its proposal of an external investment management structure for the time being, which is a good thing. The best case scenario right now would be for management to commit itself to an internal management structure while the Federal Reserve continues to lift rates. Hercules Capital is a "Buy" only in the best case scenario in my opinion. Otherwise, I would expect the fear discount to persist and Hercules Capital's shares to trade sideways for a longer period of time.

External management structure will likely cost shareholders more money, impacting shareholder returns. I bought Hercules Capital at the end of 2015 for my high-yield income portfolio. My weighted average purchase price was $11.33 for the 950 shares I bought. In total I paid $10,764 for my long position in Hercules Capital. I locked in a dividend yield of ~11 percent at the time. I had good reasons to purchase Hercules Capital, then still known as Hercules Technology Growth Capital. Hercules Capital had grown portfolio assets considerably, and the business development company had no problems covering its stable dividend payout. Further, positive asset sensitivity tilted the odds in favor of making an investment: Higher short term interest rates translate into higher earnings from a floating-rate investment portfolio. Simply put, the higher interest rates climb, the more money companies like Hercules Capital make from their variable-rate debt investments, potentially allowing the company to pay a higher regular cash dividend, or even a special dividend. Why I Am Out Now Hercules Capital has produced good returns for shareholders (including me), partly because of Hercules Capital's internal management structure and high internal rates of return. In my last piece I penned on Hercules Capital I discussed the disadvantages that come with external management structures. Those disadvantages relate to two potential problems: 1. External management structures tend to come with higher management costs. Higher management costs translate into lower shareholder returns. This is intuitive because higher costs reduce profits available for distribution.
 2. External management structures create an incentive for the external manager to prioritize growth in assets under management instead of prioritizing increasing shareholder returns. Companies that have external managers are less regarded in the market, and investors often apply a discount to their valuations, reflecting those disadvantages. I don't like external management structures all that much for the two reasons discussed here. Hercules Capital's shares slumped after management said that it will ask shareholders to approve the new management structure, and it will be much harder for the business development company to explain why shares should sell for a higher premium to Net Asset Value. I think the transition to an external management structure is not in the interest of shareholders, and for that reason I am out. Your Takeaway The market reaction after Hercules Capital's announcement to transition to a new management structure speaks volumes: Investors don't like it, and neither do I. Higher management costs and an incentive to grow assets are good enough reasons to re-evaluate Hercules Capital. Whether shareholder returns will indeed decrease or not remains to be seen, but the market clearly doesn't like management's actions. I am out.

I am largely investing in dividend paying stocks, but also venture out occasionally and cover special situations that offer appealing reward-to-risk ratios and have potential for significant capital appreciation. Above all, my immediate investment goal is to achieve financial independence.

Is Hercules Capital a Business Development Company ("BDC")?


	Yes – Hercules Capital is a Business Development Company ("BDC").

What is a Business Development Company ("BDC")


	Congress created Business Development Companies (BDCs) in 1980 to provide public investors another means to invest in the long-term growth of private U.S. businesses. BDCs invest their capital primarily in small and middle market private companies in the U.S. Typically, BDCs are structured to originate and hold debt and equity investments to maturity and can invest across a portfolio company's capital structure.

	In order to qualify as a BDC, companies must be registered in compliance with Section 54 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Among other restrictions, BDCs are required to maintain an asset coverage ratio of at least 200% in order to borrow or pay dividends and to meet specific asset diversification requirements. In addition, BDCs that are regulated investment companies for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such as Hercules', are required to distribute at least 90% of investment company taxable income to shareholders in order to avoid corporate income tax on distributed taxable income.

How is Hercules' different than other BDCs?


	Hercules is the leading BDC focused on providing specialty financing to innovative venture capital-back growth stage companies.  Hercules is also an internally managed BDC.

What is "venture debt"?


	Venture debt is a type of debt financing provided to venture capital and private equity-backed companies to fund working capital or operating expenses. Venture leasing, or equipment financing, is a specific type of venture debt which is used to purchase equipment, land and other tangible assets. Unlike traditional bank lending, venture debt is available to startups and growth companies that do not have positive cash flows or significant assets to use as collateral. Venture debt providers combine their loans with warrants, or rights to purchase equity, to compensate for the higher risk of default.

What are the benefits of "venture debt" compared with traditional equity venture capital funding?


	For companies at critical stages of development, debt can serve as the right financing option to foster growth, with minimal dilution of equity ownership. Our debt financing solutions are intended to complement equity. Click here for the benefits of venture debt.

Where can I find information on Hercules' net asset value?

Will I receive a Form 1099 or a K-1 for dividends and distributions?


	You will receive a Form 1099.

Who generates my 1099, and whom should I call if I did not receive one?


	Form 1099s are generated by your own brokerage firm. If you did not receive a Form 1099, you should contact your broker.

Is Hercules Capital's dividend a "qualified dividend"?


	No. Hercules Capital's dividend is generally not a "qualified dividend" for tax purposes and therefore generally is not eligible for the lower qualified dividend tax rate. As a regulated investment company, Hercules Capital generally does not pay income taxes on its earnings at the corporate level, but passes its income through to shareholders in the nature that it was earned. Therefore, a portion of our dividend is usually taxable to our shareholders at their ordinary income tax rates and a portion may qualify for the long-term capital gains tax rates. For information about taxes in respect of dividends received by you, you should consult your own tax advisor.
