Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.03. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the
sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale
by the Company.  There is no assurance that we will raise the full $120,000 as
anticipated.

Miscellaneous expenses*      $ -      $ 12,000  $ 16,000  $ 20,000  

*general administrative expenses, business development, support materials

The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Aliaksandr
Savelyeu, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the company
funds to complete the registration process. Any loans provided or to be provided
by Mr. Savelyeu to complete the registration process are not due on demand. The
obligation to Mr. Savelyeu does not bear interest. There is no written agreement
evidencing the advancement of funds by Mr. Savelyeu or the repayment of the
funds to Mr. Savelyeu. The entire transaction was verbal.  Also, these loans
would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to
implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the
OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when/if our common stocks become eligible for
trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Aliaksandr Savelyeu will not
be repaid from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the
repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Aliaksandr Savelyeu. Mr. Aliaksandr
Savelyeu will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate
revenues to pay the obligation.


Our competitors will include Ukrainian companies providing consulting businesses
in electromagnetic fields detection, shielding and protection in Ukraine. As of
the date of the Prospectus the only company that we are aware of that provides
consulting services in electromagnetic field detection, shielding and protection
is SGS Ukraine (http://www.sgsgroup.com.ua) located in Odessa. We will not be
differentiating ourselves from the foregoing, but merely competing with them.
The consulting industry in electromagnetic fields detection, shielding and
protection is fragmented and competitive, and may be difficult to penetrate. Our
competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that
we have limited operations. Older, well-established companies, companies with
substantial customer bases, longer operating histories and better financial
positions currently attract customers. Since we have limited operations, we
cannot compete with them on the basis of reputation. We do expect to compete
with them on the basis of the quality of the consulting services that we
provide.  There can be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position
against current or future competitors, particularly those with greater
financial, client database, marketing, service, technical and other resources.
Our failure to maintain a competitive position within the market could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. At this time, our principal method of competition will be through
personal contact with potential clients.

Some of the additional competitive factors that may affect our business are as
follows:

1. Number of Competitors Increase: other companies may follow our business model of
   offering consulting services to the potential customers in Ukraine and Europe,
   which will reduce our competitive edge;

2. Price: Our competitors may be offering similar service at a lower price forcing
   us to lower our prices as well and possibly offer our service at loss;


Company Description
Sand International Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 14, 2013
and established a fiscal year end of March 31. We have minimal revenues
andminimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We are formed to
operate a consulting business in  electromagnetic fields, including


 but  not
limited to consulting in microwave, electrical and ionizing detection, shielding
and protection. We offer services which incorporate site checks to establish the
areas of concern, measure and mitigate both the magnetic fields and the
electrical fields, prepare assessment surveys, offer advice on how to protect
our clients from potentially damaging radiation, electromagnetic interference
investigations, electromagnetic fields consulting services, and all types of
inspection and abatement in Ukraine. Mr. Savelyeu, our sole director and
officer, has over 3.5 years of direct experience in measuring the radiofrequency
electromagnetic field intensity levels and indirect experience in establishing
arears of concerns for the buildings and preparation of written recommendations
for shielding of the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields levels. Mr. Savelyeu
obtained this experience while working as Junior Specialist at the Karpenko
Physical-Mechanical Institute of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine
where his duties are but not limited to performing testing of the responsible
equipment of power generating, building, oil-and gas- transport systems and
electromagnetic fields as well as measuring the radiofrequency electromagnetic
field intensity levels.To date, we have had limited operations. We have
developed our business plan, ,executed a Consulting Agreement  with  Yar Centre,
a Ukraine based company, on April 25, 2014 and generated out first revenue of
$900 on June 24, 2014 pursuant to the signed agreement.   
---

We  operate a consulting business in electromagnetic fields in Ukraine. We do 
not plan to target any particular businesses initially and do not intend on 
concentrating on any particular geographic markets within Ukraine. We plan to 
expand our services to North American market in the future if we have the 
available resources and growth to warrant it.

We maintain our statutory registered agent's office at 2360 Corporate Circle, 
Ste. 400 Henderson, Nevada 89074-7722. Our business office is located at
