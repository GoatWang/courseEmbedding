Ronald A. Woessner, CEO




Safer Officers 




                            Officers can’t predict the future, but they can enter the future better prepared.                        




Ronald A. Woessner, CEO




Safer Schools 




                            Your community’s schools need to be a safe place for its students. With COPsync, your schools can be safer.                        




Ronald A. Woessner, CEO




Safer Communities




                            In a world where a large number of assets are needed from multiple departments for major acts of terror or violence, unified community communication is essential.                        












Questions About COPsync?
            				Have a question about the Company or COPsync products? Visit booth #336 at the Sheriffs' Association of Texas Conference at the Gaylord Texan Convention Center in Grapevine, TX on July 30-31 













 
Officers
Advance notification of violence against officers.  Real-time non-adjudicated information sharing that crosses agency lines. View Officer Products 





 
Schools
Just-in-time live, unified communication between officers, dispatch, and a school threatened or under attack.  Get officers on scene faster with shortened response times. View School Products 





 
Community Safety
Alert notification and enterprise safety tools for hi-target buildings and the workers that keep local economies strong.  View Community Products 
























                            COPsync cares about the seeming culture of violence that is sweeping America                        
Every 61 hours an American family loses a loved one who served in law enforcement, and a community loses a hero. Source







                            COPsync cares about the seeming culture of violence that is sweeping America                        
Each week since 2013 there is an average of 1 school shooting in the U.S.  When a student’s life is lost, a family loses a treasure; the world loses someone who may have changed it. Source







                            COPsync cares about the seeming culture of violence that is sweeping America                        
64% of the mass shootings between 1984 and 2016 happened in public places or work places.  3% were at houses of worship.  So is there a place left where we can be safe? Source











From over 600 Law Enforcement Agencies to Courthouses to Schools and Companies, COPsync is helping to better prepare our officers and keep our communities safer.

I believe COPsync has the power to create stronger, safer communities by protecting schools, children and citizens under threat with the COPsync911 threat alert service and other 21st-century technologies that protect and arm law enforcement officers with information to interdict crime and criminals more effectively. Elbert Guillory, Louisiana State Senator






After examining offerings from several other companies, COPsync clearly stood out by providing a complete mobile information sharing package. With the COPsync technology, our officers will benefit from the safety provided by real-time information sharing and our community will benefit from more efficient and proactive police protection. Kelly Smith, Police Chief, Van, Texas






Having the COPsync911 system in place will significantly reduce the time required for police to respond to a critical incident at Central Falls’ public schools, and will help coordinate the response effort among school staff, dispatchers and officers. This system significantly enhances the ability of officers dedicated to protecting our schools to do so in a timely and effective manner. Col. James J. Mendonca, Chief of Police, Central Falls Police Department Central Falls, RI






After learning more about the software and receiving an on-site demonstration, it was easy to see how COPsync will increase department efficiency and morale by reducing paperwork and redundant data entry. COPsync provides instant access to law enforcement databases from jurisdictions across the country creating an information network that provides an additional layer of security to our officers and community. Don Howard, Sheriff, Sterling, County, Texas






I would just like to take a moment and thank you for such a great support team. I have dealt mainly with Tinman Tran. He is always so quick to respond to my request and fix whatever is wrong with my computer. Your support team, in whole, is superb. I thoroughly have enjoyed my technical relationship I have grown to have with Tinman. Thank you for all that your company does for me and my brothers in blue. Brandon Logan, Linden Police Department

Safer Officers





 







            	Safer Officers            








Safer Officers
For officers, there is no such thing as routine. Simple encounters can escalate. It is likely that a person who might harm an officer today was a threat to an officer in the past. Another officer may have seen that tendency, but did not have a method to post a warning, until now. Problem solved, with COPsync.
Patrol Unit MDT Software
The COPsync Network is a nationally shared network of law enforcement information. Officers add new data to the Network every day as they gather information that will be important to another officer. Information in the COPsync Network is secure, accessible only by officers, and available immediately, so there is no need to wait for critical officer safety or crime solving information to become adjudicated. COPsync is by officers for officers!

Computers and Accessories
Whether it is MDT software or in-car video, we want your experience with us to be turnkey. Computers, tablets, mounting hardware, printers and the personnel to install all hardware and software are available from COPsync.

COPsync to Begin Program to Solicit Grant Funds



 Download as PDF

December 19, 2016

Grant funding sought to build shareholder value and accelerate sales growth

DALLAS, Dec. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- COPsync, Inc. (NASDAQ: COYN) announced today that it is implementing a program to secure grant funding for cities and schools to use the COPsync products and services. This will help achieve the goal of keeping communities, their children and their law enforcement officers safer and speeding first responder response times. Grant monies are expected to be sought from corporations, private foundations and state and federal agencies. Ward E. Leber, COPsync board member and founder of the Child Safety Network (CSN) will direct the Company's grant solicitation activities. 

Mr. Leber stated, "Charitable giving in the U.S. tops $350 billion each year. While the COPsync systems are not a cure for school shootings or the priceless cost of losing a child's life to violence, COPsync does save lives and reduce the impact that crime and violence have on our communities. An enormous amount of grant funding is available from both government and private foundations to reduce the damage caused by violence. Communities that need financial assistance to help provide safety and security for their children are worthy recipients of such funds. CSN will work hard to acquire grant funding to communities that need financial aid to take advantage of COPsync's life-saving systems." 
"Mr. Leber has a proven track record of raising grant funds through the relationships he has developed over decades of leadership at CSN," said Ronald A. Woessner, CEO of COPsync. "The Company's growth could be accelerated through grant monies to customers for using its suite of products and services. These funds could also be viewed as a non-dilutive source of Company capital funding since accelerated sales speeds the time to cash-flow profitability and lessens the need for equity capital funding. We are honored to be assisted by CSN and Mr. Leber, both well-known and respected in national child safety circles."  
About COPsync, Inc.

I believe COPsync has the power to create stronger, safer communities by protecting schools, children and citizens under threat with the COPsync911 threat alert service and other 21st-century technologies that protect and arm law enforcement officers with information to interdict crime and criminals more effectively. Elbert Guillory, Louisiana State Senator






After examining offerings from several other companies, COPsync clearly stood out by providing a complete mobile information sharing package. With the COPsync technology, our officers will benefit from the safety provided by real-time information sharing and our community will benefit from more efficient and proactive police protection. Kelly Smith, Police Chief, Van, Texas






Having the COPsync911 system in place will significantly reduce the time required for police to respond to a critical incident at Central Falls’ public schools, and will help coordinate the response effort among school staff, dispatchers and officers. This system significantly enhances the ability of officers dedicated to protecting our schools to do so in a timely and effective manner. Col. James J. Mendonca, Chief of Police, Central Falls Police Department Central Falls, RI






After learning more about the software and receiving an on-site demonstration, it was easy to see how COPsync will increase department efficiency and morale by reducing paperwork and redundant data entry. COPsync provides instant access to law enforcement databases from jurisdictions across the country creating an information network that provides an additional layer of security to our officers and community.

 About Brandon-COPsync 
 Brandon-COPsync Law Enforcement Technology and Solutions 
Brandon-COPsync, LLC, headquartered in Danvers, Massachusetts, was founded in 2012 “exclusively” to sell nationally, the COPsync Inc. portfolio of real-time law enforcement technology products. Together, both companies partnered to address issues that continue to plague United States law enforcement since the tragic events of September 11th, 2001:

Lack of real-time mission critical information sharing between law enforcement, agencies and schools


Inability of officers and agencies to communicate in real-time among themselves and across jurisdictional boundaries.

September of 2014 marked a turning point for both companies. On September 23rd, 2014, New Hampshire’s Governor Maggie Hassan joined Brandon-COPsync (COPsync911) to launch New Hampshire’s School Emergency Notification Initiative through a multi-year and multimillion dollar statewide contract that was approved by New Hampshire’s Executive Council and funded through a federal Emergency Management Performance Grant.
Today, Brandon-COPsync provides the nation’s largest law enforcement real-time, in-car information sharing, communication and data interoperability network, and the COPsync911 threat alert system for schools, government buildings, hospitals and other high risk targets.  For over a generation (combined) Brandon-COPsync’s management team has specialized in representing technology companies seeking to enhance public safety, law enforcement and homeland security.

 Educational Institutions 
Schools, Colleges and Universities
 School Shootings: Every Second Counts 
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for teaching and learning, free of violence.  Until now, developing a solution to respond to potential incidents of targeted school violence has been challenging, complex and without answers.  COPsync911 (“CS911”) is a revolutionary school safety tool providing a real-time threat alert and notification system.  In the event of a threat, school administrators or faculty can activate CS911 by clicking on an icon — instantly sending an alert to the (5) closest law enforcement patrol cars (regardless of agency or jurisdiction) and dispatch.
The CS911 software platform provides a real-time chat window and allows faculty or staff to provide pertinent and reliable information via instant message to law enforcement. CS911 provides offers and dispatch with threat location (address and room number), GPS directions to the threat, and an interactive floor plan schematic of the school building — enabling officers to respond on scene faster with exact knowledge of the location of the threat.
The system alleviates the following challenges during times of threat:

Lack of real-time, mission critical information sharing among school officials, officers and agencies at the point of incident
Inability of officers and agencies to communicate among themselves and across jurisdictional boundaries in real-time
Risks to officer safety and unsatisfactory response time in incidents of targeted school violence

Brandon-COPsync empowers educators with the latest, most powerful and innovative technology solutions. These solutions include providing law enforcement, school administrators, faculty and school resource officers with a real-time information sharing platform.  Until now, one of the greatest challenges facing school safety has been the inability of teachers to communicate directly with law enforcement.  COPsync provides teachers/faculty with real-time outbound and inbound communications and peace of mind that help is on the way – and communications continue in real time.


 
 
 







 Law Enforcement  
 Transforming law enforcement in real-time! 
New threats to the United States and to our law enforcement officers are greatly expanding in numbers, scope and lethality.  The COPsync network is the only network in the United States that enables all law enforcement agencies and officers to share one common communications platform, regardless of jurisdiction.
For the first time in policing, COPsync arms officers and dispatch with real-time reliable intelligence through a crisis communication portal.  The officer safety crisis communication portal (“ccp”) provides officers with the threat location and a map of the building, along with any further information given through the COPsync chat portal (i.e description of a shooter, which way they are heading).  Brandon-COPsync is the nation’s only real-time information sharing, threat alert and notification system that is certified by the Criminal Justice Information System (“CJIS”).

(  NASDAQ :  COYN ) today stated a positive 2017 business outlook for its core products, the COPsync law enforcement real-time information sharing and communication Network™ and the COPsync911™ threat-alert system for schools, courthouses, government buildings and other potentially at-risk facilities.This positive outlook results from the Company's record 2016 sales bookings, its strong sales bookings thus far in 2017 and policies expected to flow from the Trump Administration.These strong 2016 and 2017 sales bookings result, in part, from the Company's new sales strategy of collaborating with law enforcement and school subject matter experts and influencers. This new sales strategy has shortened the sales cycle and increased sales velocity.In addition to increasing domestic demand for its products, the Company has seen interest in its products and services in the Caribbean. A recent Company press announcement noted the intent of the City of Arecibo, Puerto Rico to broadly deploy the Company's products and services and thereby earn the title as the "Safest City in the Caribbean."Further, the Trump Administration is expected to promote policies that favor law enforcement, crime reduction and border security. Since the Company's services provide indisputable value in each of these areas, these new administration policies are expected to create a strong "tailwind" to buoy the Company's increasing sales momentum.Mr. Ronald A. Woessner, CEO of COPsync, commented, "The Company achieved record sales bookings in 2016, and 2017 sales bookings to-date have exceeded comparable period sales bookings in prior years. The Company will be announcing these sales bookings numbers soon. We believe this increasing sales momentum will continue throughout 2017."About COPsync, Inc.COPsync, Inc.

Approximately $1.2 million in initial expense reduction have already been realized, with additional expense reduction anticipated within the next several weeks.
Phil Anderson, acting CFO and interim CEO, explained, "The purpose of the expense reduction is to align our fixed costs with our current revenue and gross profit. These cost savings were realized through headcount reduction with buy-in from departmental heads to ensure that the company can appropriately support our customer base and also execute on our short and long-term sales pipeline."
Under Mr. Anderson's leadership, the Company has also restructured the executive leadership team with the appointment of two professionals to increase experience and expertise in key sales and marketing roles.
COPsync is pleased to welcome Scott Platzer as the new Director of Sales. Mr. Platzer is a former Green Beret and an experienced entrepreneur and software sales executive. Scott will refocus domestic sales efforts on key states and lead the closing of large account prospects.
COPsync has also engaged John Marchese, Managing Partner of Marchese Associates marketing consultants. With a 30+ year track record of building brands and a specialty in B2B technology product and service marketing, Mr. Marchese has served global Fortune 100 enterprises as well as small and medium-sized public and private businesses.
"John will be serving as interim Chief Marketing Officer and a member of the executive leadership team. We welcome John's extensive consulting and management experience to COPsync," Mr. Anderson noted. "His primary responsibilities will include corporate positioning, integrated marketing planning, plan management and execution while supporting Scott and his reorganized sales team."
Mr. Anderson continued, "In addition to reducing overhead costs and increasing Company efficiency, our immediate goals also include the continuing of COPsync expansion in Puerto Rico. Based on the progress of our Puerto Rican team, we anticipate additional contracts in the near future."
