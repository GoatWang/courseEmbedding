Manitowoc News






Tuesday, July 25, 2017Barge-mounted MLC300 brings enhanced stability to Illinois bridge replacementWhen the Manitowoc MLC300 crawler crane debuted with Variable Position Counterweight (VPC) and VPC-MAX heavy lift attachment, one of its unique selling points was the crane’s barge-lifting capabilities. The reduced footprint and floating counterweight meant that it would be much more efficient for lifters to barge-mount a crawler crane. Contracting teams could erect the crane onto smaller water-based barges because the machine automatically adjusts its center of gravity for each lift.Tuesday, July 11, 2017In Florida power line erection, Grove GHC75 boosts efficiency to shorten schedule by two weeksNorth American companies are reaping the benefits of using Grove telescoping crawler cranes on a variety of jobs. Their combination of crawler maneuverability, telescoping boom versatility and 100 percent pick-and-carry capability is helping lifters increase efficiency on a wide variety of projects.Thursday, July 06, 2017Petro-Sea Logistics further bolsters its Grove all-terrain fleetPetro-Sea Logistics, a joint venture between Belgium’s Sea-Invest and Ivory Coast’s Petroci, began buying Grove all-terrain cranes in 2016, and that trend continues in 2017 with the addition of a GMK5180-1. The company made the switch from another brand’s all-terrain range and hasn’t turned back, thanks in part to the reliability of new Grove models, and especially for the aftermarket service that Manitowoc provides the company.Tuesday, July 04, 2017Three Potain MCT 85 cranes help deliver luxury residences in IndiaKolkata-based Indian real estate company PS Group is using three Potain MCT 85 topless cranes to help construct its much-anticipated residential project, PS Panache. Wednesday, June 28, 2017Potain and Grove cranes inspire sales at Turkish trade fair KomatekPotain and Grove cranes were showcased at international construction equipment trade fair, Komatek 2017, in Ankara, Turkey, this May. Manitowoc was represented at the show through two of its Turkish dealers, Istanbul-based TeknoVinç and Ankara-based Karun. Potain distributor, TeknoVinç, displayed a Hup 32-27 and a MDT 219 at the show, while Grove distributor, Karun, presented a GMK6300L.

Cubers
Designed for operators who know that ice is critical to their business. Manitowoc Ice cuber ice machines deliver clear cubed ice with maximum cooling efficiency.






Flakers
Highly reliable flaker ice machines that deliver small, soft pieces of ice—ideal for presentation applications in retail and other operations. 






Nugget

History[edit]




Launch of the USS Robalo (SS-273) at Manitowoc


Manitowoc Company, Inc. was founded by Charles West and Elias Gunnell in the lakeshore community of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, in 1902. It was known as a shipbuilding and ship-repair company under the name Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company. Since that time, the company has grown and diversified, entering the lattice-boom crane business in the mid-1920s and branching into commercial refrigeration equipment shortly after World War II. During World War II, the Department of the Navy contracted Manitowoc to build a total of 28 submarines, plus the canceled USS Chicolar (SS-464).[4] Before they built the submarines for the Department of the Navy, the company built car ferries.[citation needed] In November 2002, the company acquired the Grove Crane company for approximately $271 million.
Construction[edit]

History[edit]




Launch of the USS Robalo (SS-273) at Manitowoc


Manitowoc Company, Inc. was founded by Charles West and Elias Gunnell in the lakeshore community of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, in 1902. It was known as a shipbuilding and ship-repair company under the name Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company. Since that time, the company has grown and diversified, entering the lattice-boom crane business in the mid-1920s and branching into commercial refrigeration equipment shortly after World War II. During World War II, the Department of the Navy contracted Manitowoc to build a total of 28 submarines, plus the canceled USS Chicolar (SS-464).[4] Before they built the submarines for the Department of the Navy, the company built car ferries.[citation needed] In November 2002, the company acquired the Grove Crane company for approximately $271 million.
Construction[edit]
Main article: Manitowoc Cranes
Manitowoc produces several lines of cranes to serve the construction industries. The company produces high-capacity lattice-boom crawler cranes, tower cranes, and mobile telescopic cranes for heavy construction, commercial construction, energy-related, wind farm,[5] infrastructure, duty-cycle and crane-rental applications. It is also a producer of boom trucks.
Main Brands:

Manitowoc cranes — Crawler cranes
Grove cranes — rough-terrain, truck-mounted, all-terrain, Grove YardBoss, industrial cranes and Shuttlelift carry deck cranes. Grove began producing cranes in 1947 in Shady Grove, Pa.

Foodservice division[edit]
Manitowoc Foodservice is a sub-division of the Manitowoc Company that produces ice machines and refrigeration equipment for businesses.
In 2008, the company acquired Enodis PLC, a UK-based supplier of restaurant equipment, including fryers, ovens, and ice machines. Manitowoc Foodservice announced that they would be selling off the ice division of Enodis, and the sale of that division has been completed.[6]

The Marinette shipyard, Marinette Marine, built the first Freedom class littoral combat ship for the United States Navy, and the United States Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw. In August 2008, Manitowoc Marine Division repaired the SS Badger. The SS Badger is like the car ferries that were built by Manitowoc Company before they built 28 submarines for the defense department during World War II.[citation needed] The Manitowoc Company announced in August 2008 a proposal to sell the marine division to Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri.[11] The sale closed on December 31, 2008.[12]

History[edit]




Launch of the USS Robalo (SS-273) at Manitowoc


Manitowoc Company, Inc. was founded by Charles West and Elias Gunnell in the lakeshore community of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, in 1902. It was known as a shipbuilding and ship-repair company under the name Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company. Since that time, the company has grown and diversified, entering the lattice-boom crane business in the mid-1920s and branching into commercial refrigeration equipment shortly after World War II. During World War II, the Department of the Navy contracted Manitowoc to build a total of 28 submarines, plus the canceled USS Chicolar (SS-464).[4] Before they built the submarines for the Department of the Navy, the company built car ferries.[citation needed] In November 2002, the company acquired the Grove Crane company for approximately $271 million.
Construction[edit]
Main article: Manitowoc Cranes
Manitowoc produces several lines of cranes to serve the construction industries. The company produces high-capacity lattice-boom crawler cranes, tower cranes, and mobile telescopic cranes for heavy construction, commercial construction, energy-related, wind farm,[5] infrastructure, duty-cycle and crane-rental applications. It is also a producer of boom trucks.
Main Brands:

Manitowoc cranes — Crawler cranes
Grove cranes — rough-terrain, truck-mounted, all-terrain, Grove YardBoss, industrial cranes and Shuttlelift carry deck cranes. Grove began producing cranes in 1947 in Shady Grove, Pa.





Potain at Reed Exhibitions event Batimat



Potain cranes — Tower cranes and Self erecting tower cranes. Founded in La Clayette, France in 1928.
National Crane — Telescoping Boom Trucks (articulating line was discontinued at the end of 2008). Founded in Waverly, Nebraska in 1963 and all production of National Crane Boom Trucks moved to Shady Grove, Pa. after the acquisition by Manitowoc.
Manitowoc Crane Care — customer service branch established in 2000. Crane Care operates in 15 countries at 22 locations.

Foodservice division[edit]
Manitowoc Foodservice is a sub-division of the Manitowoc Company that produces ice machines and refrigeration equipment for businesses.
In 2008, the company acquired Enodis PLC, a UK-based supplier of restaurant equipment, including fryers, ovens, and ice machines. Manitowoc Foodservice announced that they would be selling off the ice division of Enodis, and the sale of that division has been completed.[6]
On March 4, 2016 The Manitowoc Company completed a one for one common share split and created Manitowoc Foodservices. As of March 7, 2016 the newly created company began standard stock offerings on the NYSE under the symbol "MFS"[7]
The newly formed company is under the leadership of former Manitowoc Company executive Hubertus M. Muehlhaeuser, who currently has eight direct reports are the current executives.[8] They are supported by a seven-member board of directors which includes Mr. Muehlhaeuser.[9]
Manitowoc Foodservices consists of 23 global brands that include 12 holding either #1 or #2 position in their respected global markets.[10]
Marine division[edit]
Manitowoc Marine is a subdivision of the Manitowoc Company, which builds and repairs commercial and military ships at yards in Marinette, Wisconsin; Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin; and Cleveland, Ohio. The Marinette shipyard, Marinette Marine, built the first Freedom class littoral combat ship for the United States Navy, and the United States Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw. In August 2008, Manitowoc Marine Division repaired the SS Badger. The SS Badger is like the car ferries that were built by Manitowoc Company before they built 28 submarines for the defense department during World War II.[citation needed] The Manitowoc Company announced in August 2008 a proposal to sell the marine division to Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri.[11] The sale closed on December 31, 2008.[12]

History[edit]
Manitowoc Cranes began as a business venture by Charles West and Elias Gunnell. At the time, they headed the Manitowoc Dry Dock Company, now The Manitowoc Company, Inc. After World War I, The Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company was looking to diversify their business.[1]

After observing the Moore Speedcrane, manufactured in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Charles West thought cranes were a way to expand the business and use his shipyard's machine shops. In 1925, The Moore Speedcrane Company was in debt, and Charles West was willing to help them build cranes to help provide cash for the struggling company. All patents were signed over to Manitowoc as a liability; however, they would not sell any machines under the Manitowoc name.[1]
The Speedcrane in 1925 was a steam-driven, 15-ton capacity crane that sat on four wheels. Ten models were built by Manitowoc from this basic model. Eventually, after listening to customer feedback, Moore redesigned the crane and installed a gasoline engine. Another major change was the replacement of the wheels with a crawler base that allowed for better traction. The first model from the redesigned Speedcrane was a Model 100.[1]
The Moore Speedcrane Company continued to introduce new models with innovative features; however, this put them deeper into debt. In 1928, when it was apparent that Moore was not going to be able to pay back the debts owed to Manitowoc, they began to manufacture and sell Speedcranes with its own sales force.[1]
The Manitowoc Crane and Manitowoc Food Service Groups separated into two stand alone companies in March 2016. Manitowoc Cranes Stock Symbol MTW and Manitowoc Food Service stock Symbol MFS.
Formation[edit]
In 1994, Manitowoc acquired Femco Machine Company, a manufacturer of crane parts. Femco and Manitowoc Re-manufacturing were consolidated to form the Aftermarket Group. In March 2003, Manitowoc sold Femco Machine Company to a group of private investors[2]
Manitex, a boom truck line, was formed by Manitowoc in 1983. Manitowoc acquired two more boom truck companies - USTC in 1998 and Pioneer in 2000. These three brands were combined to form Manitowoc Boom Truck.[3] In 2003, Manitowoc sold off the Manitowoc Boom Truck brand to Quantum Heavy Equipment, LLC.[4]
West-Manitowoc was formed as a separate division of the Manitowoc Corporation in 1994 as the brainchild of Fred Butler, the President of the corporation at that time. The primary purpose of this division was to re-enter the manufacture and marketing of smaller lattice boom crawler cranes, (130 tons and under capacity); a size class that had been dropped from Manitowoc Cranes product line a few years earlier. In its relatively short existence, the West division achieved a leading market position in the U.S. for the 100 ton class of crawler cranes, and became the corporation's leading "Economic Value Added (EVA)" contributor.[citation needed] After re-establishing a market position for the company in the smaller class of crawler cranes, the West-Manitowoc division was merged with Manitowoc Cranes in 1998.
Manitowoc acquired the Potain brand in 2001,[5] followed by Grove and National Crane in 2002. The announcement to acquire Grove Worldwide was made in March 2002 at CONEXPO in Las Vegas, Nevada. Manitowoc purchased Grove for $271 million.[6]
In 2007, Manitowoc announced their acquisition of Shirke, an India-based Potain manufacturer and distributor since 1982.[citation needed]
Brands[edit]
Grove[edit]
Mobile hydraulic cranes[edit]

Manitowoc's Grove product line includes rough-terrain, truck-mounted, all-terrain, Grove YardBoss, industrial cranes and Shuttlelift Carrydeck cranes. Grove is also a major supplier of custom-built machines to armed forces around the world. The Grove brand includes over 40 models with lifting capacities ranging from 8.5 USt to 550 USt.
In 1947, Grove Manufacturing Company was founded by brothers Dwight L. Grove and John L. Grove and friend Wayne A. Nicarry to produce rubber-tire farm wagons. The company began in a small, rented two-car garage in Shady Grove, Pennsylvania. Grove started out small by building yard-type cranes for its own use and later expanded to produce cranes commercially. As a manufacturer, it has achieved a number of "firsts" in the course of its history, including introducing the world’s first slewing rough terrain crane in 1968 and the world’s first trapezoidal boom in 1970; and by becoming the first international multi-facility crane manufacturer to receive the ISO 9001 quality assurance certification in 1994.
Manitowoc[edit]
Lattice-boom crawler cranes[edit]

The Manitowoc crawler crane product line has 16 products and two capacity-enhancing attachments. Manitowoc lattice-boom crawler cranes was the beginning of Manitowoc Cranes until the major acquisitions in 2001. In 1969, Manitowoc introduced its flagship crane, the Model 4100W. Manitowoc introduced its first self-erecting, all-hydraulic crane, the Model M-250, in 1992.
National Crane[edit]
Boom Trucks[edit]
Manitowoc also manufactures National Crane Boom Trucks, a line of telescoping boom truck cranes. National Crane was founded in Nebraska by Marlo Burg in 1947, and began by manufacturing roadside weed sprayers. In 1952, National also introduced a line of front-end loaders. Operations were moved to Waverly, Nebraska in 1962, and the name National Crane Corporation was adopted. After ownership passed through a number of companies, Manitowoc acquired National Cranes in 2002, and all production moved to the Grove U.S. LLC, Shady Grove, Pennsylvania facility in 2003.[7]
Potain[edit]
Self-erecting and top-slewing cranes[edit]
Potain is the Manitowoc brand of tower cranes. They produce both top-slewing and self-erecting models. Potain was a French-based company founded in La Clayette, France, in 1928 by Faustin Potain. The first crane was assembled in 1933.

Manitowoc Cranes began as a business venture by Charles West and Elias Gunnell. At the time, they headed the Manitowoc Dry Dock Company, now The Manitowoc Company, Inc. After World War I, The Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company was looking to diversify their business.[1]

After observing the Moore Speedcrane, manufactured in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Charles West thought cranes were a way to expand the business and use his shipyard's machine shops. In 1925, The Moore Speedcrane Company was in debt, and Charles West was willing to help them build cranes to help provide cash for the struggling company. All patents were signed over to Manitowoc as a liability; however, they would not sell any machines under the Manitowoc name.[1]
The Speedcrane in 1925 was a steam-driven, 15-ton capacity crane that sat on four wheels. Ten models were built by Manitowoc from this basic model. Eventually, after listening to customer feedback, Moore redesigned the crane and installed a gasoline engine. Another major change was the replacement of the wheels with a crawler base that allowed for better traction. The first model from the redesigned Speedcrane was a Model 100.[1]
The Moore Speedcrane Company continued to introduce new models with innovative features; however, this put them deeper into debt. In 1928, when it was apparent that Moore was not going to be able to pay back the debts owed to Manitowoc, they began to manufacture and sell Speedcranes with its own sales force.[1]
The Manitowoc Crane and Manitowoc Food Service Groups separated into two stand alone companies in March 2016. Manitowoc Cranes Stock Symbol MTW and Manitowoc Food Service stock Symbol MFS.
Formation[edit]
In 1994, Manitowoc acquired Femco Machine Company, a manufacturer of crane parts. Femco and Manitowoc Re-manufacturing were consolidated to form the Aftermarket Group. In March 2003, Manitowoc sold Femco Machine Company to a group of private investors[2]
Manitex, a boom truck line, was formed by Manitowoc in 1983. Manitowoc acquired two more boom truck companies - USTC in 1998 and Pioneer in 2000. These three brands were combined to form Manitowoc Boom Truck.[3] In 2003, Manitowoc sold off the Manitowoc Boom Truck brand to Quantum Heavy Equipment, LLC.[4]
West-Manitowoc was formed as a separate division of the Manitowoc Corporation in 1994 as the brainchild of Fred Butler, the President of the corporation at that time. The primary purpose of this division was to re-enter the manufacture and marketing of smaller lattice boom crawler cranes, (130 tons and under capacity); a size class that had been dropped from Manitowoc Cranes product line a few years earlier. In its relatively short existence, the West division achieved a leading market position in the U.S. for the 100 ton class of crawler cranes, and became the corporation's leading "Economic Value Added (EVA)" contributor.[citation needed] After re-establishing a market position for the company in the smaller class of crawler cranes, the West-Manitowoc division was merged with Manitowoc Cranes in 1998.
Manitowoc acquired the Potain brand in 2001,[5] followed by Grove and National Crane in 2002. The announcement to acquire Grove Worldwide was made in March 2002 at CONEXPO in Las Vegas, Nevada. Manitowoc purchased Grove for $271 million.[6]
In 2007, Manitowoc announced their acquisition of Shirke, an India-based Potain manufacturer and distributor since 1982.[citation needed]

Grove is also a major supplier of custom-built machines to armed forces around the world. The Grove brand includes over 40 models with lifting capacities ranging from 8.5 USt to 550 USt.
In 1947, Grove Manufacturing Company was founded by brothers Dwight L. Grove and John L. Grove and friend Wayne A. Nicarry to produce rubber-tire farm wagons. The company began in a small, rented two-car garage in Shady Grove, Pennsylvania. Grove started out small by building yard-type cranes for its own use and later expanded to produce cranes commercially. As a manufacturer, it has achieved a number of "firsts" in the course of its history, including introducing the world’s first slewing rough terrain crane in 1968 and the world’s first trapezoidal boom in 1970; and by becoming the first international multi-facility crane manufacturer to receive the ISO 9001 quality assurance certification in 1994.

History[edit]
Manitowoc Cranes began as a business venture by Charles West and Elias Gunnell. At the time, they headed the Manitowoc Dry Dock Company, now The Manitowoc Company, Inc. After World War I, The Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company was looking to diversify their business.[1]

After observing the Moore Speedcrane, manufactured in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Charles West thought cranes were a way to expand the business and use his shipyard's machine shops. In 1925, The Moore Speedcrane Company was in debt, and Charles West was willing to help them build cranes to help provide cash for the struggling company. All patents were signed over to Manitowoc as a liability; however, they would not sell any machines under the Manitowoc name.[1]
The Speedcrane in 1925 was a steam-driven, 15-ton capacity crane that sat on four wheels. Ten models were built by Manitowoc from this basic model. Eventually, after listening to customer feedback, Moore redesigned the crane and installed a gasoline engine. Another major change was the replacement of the wheels with a crawler base that allowed for better traction. The first model from the redesigned Speedcrane was a Model 100.[1]
The Moore Speedcrane Company continued to introduce new models with innovative features; however, this put them deeper into debt. In 1928, when it was apparent that Moore was not going to be able to pay back the debts owed to Manitowoc, they began to manufacture and sell Speedcranes with its own sales force.[1]
The Manitowoc Crane and Manitowoc Food Service Groups separated into two stand alone companies in March 2016. Manitowoc Cranes Stock Symbol MTW and Manitowoc Food Service stock Symbol MFS.
Formation[edit]
In 1994, Manitowoc acquired Femco Machine Company, a manufacturer of crane parts. Femco and Manitowoc Re-manufacturing were consolidated to form the Aftermarket Group. In March 2003, Manitowoc sold Femco Machine Company to a group of private investors[2]
Manitex, a boom truck line, was formed by Manitowoc in 1983. Manitowoc acquired two more boom truck companies - USTC in 1998 and Pioneer in 2000. These three brands were combined to form Manitowoc Boom Truck.[3] In 2003, Manitowoc sold off the Manitowoc Boom Truck brand to Quantum Heavy Equipment, LLC.[4]
West-Manitowoc was formed as a separate division of the Manitowoc Corporation in 1994 as the brainchild of Fred Butler, the President of the corporation at that time. The primary purpose of this division was to re-enter the manufacture and marketing of smaller lattice boom crawler cranes, (130 tons and under capacity); a size class that had been dropped from Manitowoc Cranes product line a few years earlier. In its relatively short existence, the West division achieved a leading market position in the U.S. for the 100 ton class of crawler cranes, and became the corporation's leading "Economic Value Added (EVA)" contributor.[citation needed] After re-establishing a market position for the company in the smaller class of crawler cranes, the West-Manitowoc division was merged with Manitowoc Cranes in 1998.
Manitowoc acquired the Potain brand in 2001,[5] followed by Grove and National Crane in 2002. The announcement to acquire Grove Worldwide was made in March 2002 at CONEXPO in Las Vegas, Nevada. Manitowoc purchased Grove for $271 million.[6]
In 2007, Manitowoc announced their acquisition of Shirke, an India-based Potain manufacturer and distributor since 1982.[citation needed]
Brands[edit]

Manitowoc's Grove product line includes rough-terrain, truck-mounted, all-terrain, Grove YardBoss, industrial cranes and Shuttlelift Carrydeck cranes. Grove is also a major supplier of custom-built machines to armed forces around the world. The Grove brand includes over 40 models with lifting capacities ranging from 8.5 USt to 550 USt.
In 1947, Grove Manufacturing Company was founded by brothers Dwight L. Grove and John L. Grove and friend Wayne A. Nicarry to produce rubber-tire farm wagons. The company began in a small, rented two-car garage in Shady Grove, Pennsylvania. Grove started out small by building yard-type cranes for its own use and later expanded to produce cranes commercially. As a manufacturer, it has achieved a number of "firsts" in the course of its history, including introducing the world’s first slewing rough terrain crane in 1968 and the world’s first trapezoidal boom in 1970; and by becoming the first international multi-facility crane manufacturer to receive the ISO 9001 quality assurance certification in 1994.
Manitowoc[edit]
Lattice-boom crawler cranes[edit]

The Manitowoc crawler crane product line has 16 products and two capacity-enhancing attachments. Manitowoc lattice-boom crawler cranes was the beginning of Manitowoc Cranes until the major acquisitions in 2001. In 1969, Manitowoc introduced its flagship crane, the Model 4100W. Manitowoc introduced its first self-erecting, all-hydraulic crane, the Model M-250, in 1992.
National Crane[edit]
Boom Trucks[edit]
Manitowoc also manufactures National Crane Boom Trucks, a line of telescoping boom truck cranes. National Crane was founded in Nebraska by Marlo Burg in 1947, and began by manufacturing roadside weed sprayers. In 1952, National also introduced a line of front-end loaders. Operations were moved to Waverly, Nebraska in 1962, and the name National Crane Corporation was adopted. After ownership passed through a number of companies, Manitowoc acquired National Cranes in 2002, and all production moved to the Grove U.S. LLC, Shady Grove, Pennsylvania facility in 2003.[7]
Potain[edit]
Self-erecting and top-slewing cranes[edit]
Potain is the Manitowoc brand of tower cranes. They produce both top-slewing and self-erecting models. Potain was a French-based company founded in La Clayette, France, in 1928 by Faustin Potain. The first crane was assembled in 1933.

These smaller ice makers can potentially produce up to 35 pounds of ice a day, oftentimes with the first batch ready in just 10 minutes. This means no more hassling with heavy, inconvenient bags of ice. A countertop ice maker fits easily on a home bar or in an RV camper without taking up too much extra space. However there are a few important variables when it comes to portable ice makers. Look through these countertop appliances and their features in order to try and properly find the perfect portable ice make for your home.Production CapacityThe amount of ice that your countertop unit can produce in a day is going to be one of the most important attributes that you’ll need to consider while researching which unit to buy. Despite being small in size, these units can sometimes produce a surprising amount of ice in a day. You can find that there are units on the market that produce anywhere from 20 to 36 lbs of ice in 24 hour period. These machines will also generally have the capacity to store an additional 1 or 2 lbs of ice as well. Frequently these machines will work with surprising speed since, sometimes able to produce and have ice cubes ready in as little as 10 minutes from the start of operation.It is important to remember that while these small machines can produce a deceptively large amount of ice in regards to their size, and even store a small amount, they aren’t freezers. So, while the common countertop ice machine is typically well-insulated, they shouldn’t be relied on to store any amount of ice for long periods of time.Easy to Move & UseIn addition to the impressive amounts of ice these portable appliances can put out, they’re also designed for countertop use, and as is such, can be moved and placed in different locations with ease. Usually they fall in between the heights of 13 – 16 inches and can be found sometimes as wide as a mere 10 inches. They can even weigh as little as only 20 lbs, which makes moving it around the house or kitchen especially easy. What’s more, these units can be filled with tap or common bottled water.Countertop units, unlike some of the more complicated commercial icemakers, are very simple to use. Since they’re lightweight and easy to transport, they don’t generally require a drain hook-up. They typically come with simple, sometimes soft-button electronic controls that can include neat features like a timer and a clock.Attractive, Space Saving DesignsIt’s not just that these nifty portable ice makers have a small footprint and can be placed almost anywhere; these countertop appliances feature attractive designs and are made from quality components. Frequently these machines are constructed with commercial-grade stainless steel. On top of that, they’ll often be given an attractive color coating like red, titanium, white, or black. In this way, it’s easy to find a color and design to go along with almost any kitchen aesthetic.The Power of the PortableMaybe your refrigerator’s internal ice maker broke down; or, perhaps you’ve just been running out of ice at parties you throw at home. Regardless of why you’re in the market for a portable countertop ice maker, take a look at what’s being offered on the online market today and find the one that perfectly fits your needs. IceMakerDirect.com has a terrific selection of various types of ice makers, and countertop types are no exception.

Undercounter ice makers are made to be built into existing cabinetry, while freestanding home ice makers can be placed anywhere within reach of an outlet. Undercounter ice makers are frequently referred to as built-in ice makers. A lot of times though a freestanding unit will actually have the capabilities to be built-in to as well, whether it be a kitchen or home bar context. Some can produce up to 60 lbs of ice a day and come in a variety of finishes to match your other appliances and decor. Both types of ice makers have models that produce crescent or cube-shaped ice. In fact, residential ice makers for the home can be found for any ice type you’d like to make. Check out the different types of ice machines for the home today.Undercounter & Built-InUndercounter or Built-In ice makers are especially popular for the home kitchen environment. An undercounter ice maker will often be a little bit taller, so that it can fit into an island or counter in a kitchen. Some are perfect for replacing older, less used appliances like trash compactors. A lot of times a trash compactor will have the same general width as a residential ice machine. Popular, slim units are often around 15 inches wide, but can still produce pounds and pounds of ice a day.Some built-in icemakers will be considerably smaller, oftentimes in height. In this way they have the versatility of being able to be installed or built into a number of different kitchen settings, not just simply under the counter. You can even find built-in ice machines that are ADA-compliant, which means that they are 36 inches or under. Meeting ADA compliance means that the appliance meets the correct height standards set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act. These types of ice makers can also be very slim, meaning that they can be installed in nearly any residential kitchen, and at the same time produce and store relatively large amounts of ice daily.Live the Freestanding Ice LifeIf a unit is labeled as freestanding, that doesn’t mean it cannot function as an undercounter appliance as well. Freestanding ice makers will typically sport front ventilation and finished sides, so it can look good standing up in any home setting. Oftentimes these units have reversible doors, allowing them to be able to switch between left hinged and right hinged doors, which gives them extra versatility in regards to installation. A freestanding ice machine will often also come with castors included, allowing them to be moved around easily. In conjunction with the castors, these units may also have leveling legs, which lets them be manipulated height-wise when necessary. All in all, a freestanding ice maker will often carry all the attributes and features an undercounter unit might, but give a little more options in the way of installation and home placement.Lots of Ice TypesThe residential ice machine works hard and can produce a lot of different kind of ice, just like commercial units. Here are some popular ice types you’re liable to find when shopping for a home icemaker.Clear IceClear ice refers to the when water is frozen in the range of 32 - 27 °F. This essentially super cools the water and gives the ice a transparent look. When an ice maker boasts that it makes “clear ice,” this is normally referring to the fact that the ice is literally clear and free of impurities.Nugget IceNugget ice is also known by a couple of other names. Sometimes called hospital ice, Sonic ice, or pellet ice, this ice type is useful because it can fill up a glass but still leave plenty of room for a liquid. Also, since it takes up so much space around the liquid, it works very well at keeping a cups’ contents cold and refreshing.Gourmet IceThis ice type is sometimes also referred to as top hat ice, since the cubes themselves have tiny lips around the base, giving them the appearance of a little hate. These cubes are generally larger and slower melting, making them popular for cocktails or neat drinks.Flake IceThis interestingly shaped ice type is similar to nugget ice in some ways. In addition to being put in beverages, flake ice is popular for acting as the base for foods on display like seafood or soft cheeses. In this way it’s good for large home-catered parties with buffet style serving tables.Square Cube IcePerhaps the most well-known and classic form of ice cube, this ice type can be seen in drinks everywhere. Popular due to ice trays that frequently make them, you can find undercounter and freestanding ice machine units alike that make this ubiquitous form of ice. Sometimes these cubes are smaller and called half-size or cubelet.For the Outdoor Ice MakerOften able to be used as an undercounter unit, some home ice makers are made from components that allow them to be operated in an outside environment. A stainless steel and corrosion-resistant exterior are common features for a model that boasts being able to be used outside. Also, this generally means these machines sport features which help them function outside of a home as well. For instance, in addition to a corrosion-resistant exterior, these appliances will have things like a thermal insulated cabinet, which helps them stay energy efficient and keep their cooling performance at its peak, despite being installed outside of a temperature controlled environment like a kitchen or living room.For nearly any type of commercial ice maker on the market there is a residential version that will do everything it’s commercial cousin does, but on a smaller scale. This includes things like stainless steel construction, included storage bins and scoops, corrosion resistant metal, and factory installed drain pumps. Take a look at the ever expanding number of residential icemakers icemakerdirect.com offers today and find the home ice machine of your dreams.×Login or sign up to save a list ofYour FavoritesLoginorSign Up×CloseSubmitPlease enter a valid email address!Thanks for Subscribing!We respect your privacy and promise to never spam you.

Details ▸ 17 Years of Service Owned and Operated in America since 1999. Encounter the Commercial KindCommercial ice makers are great for anything from a home business setting to a massive industrial environment. They produce clear ice, which means the water used is pure and has no impurities in it. Self-contained ice machines make ice and store it in one unit. These models can produce up to 700 pounds of ice a day, but can only store up to 300 pounds of ice at one time. Modular ice machines are larger and require an ice storage bin. Commercial ice storage bins are oftentimes refrigerated so the stored ice will not melt. Modular ice makers can produce up to 1400 pounds ice daily, and the attached ice bins can store up to 1800 pounds of ice. Additionally, there are also ice dispensers that are meant to produce large amounts of ice, and can sometimes even store the ice. These machines will also frequently dispense water too and can be found in environments like schools, hospitals and restaurants. It’s always important when making an important decision like purchasing a commercial ice machine to put in an appropriate amount of thought and research.Modular MachinesYou can make almost any amount of ice you might need with a modular ice machine unit. These commercial-quality machines can produce massive amounts of ice in a single day. Some of them even have the ability to make upwards of 2,000 lbs of ice per day. Generally these machines are made of stainless steel in order to increase their durability and overall longevity. Just like a normal, home portable ice maker, these commercial versions can produce a number of different ice types. Flake and nugget style ice cubes are quite popular. Because these machines make so much ice a day, they require more water and energy, and are typically suited for a commercial retail or business environment. They can also require more accessories or maintenance to keep them working at their maximum potential.For instance, since a modular machine is not stand alone and cannot store made ice by itself, it requires a commercial grade ice bin to be attached. It’s important to make sure that ice machine you pair with your storage bin doesn’t make more ice than your bin can hold. It’s also a good idea to check what type of electrical connection your modular unit needs. Large commercial ice machines might require a higher voltage than the typical 115-120 V. Frequently a great attribute of modular ice makers is that they have air-cooled condenser’s that are a part of the unit itself and don’t need to be purchased separately.Ice Storage BinsThere are about as many different type of ice storage bins as there are types of modular ice machines. This makes sense because however large of a daily production output a commercial ice machine may boast, you’ll need proper storage to keep all that ice. And if you need to hold on to that ice for a while, it helps if that storage bin is refrigerated or insulated. Your ice storage bin will also need to be NSF certified or listed. This certification is provided by the Public Health and Safety Organization and is placed on a product to show that it complies with a strict and extensive set of standards. The NSF is considered to be one of the most respected independent testing organizations.Self-Contained Ice MakersUnlike a modular ice machine which will need a large and appropriately fitted ice bin to store ice, a self-contained commercial ice unit can make and store ice without the need of an extra ice bin. While these ice machines don’t make as much ice as a typical modular unit, they still can boast impressive daily outputs. Of course just like any other commercial ice machine, self-contained units come in a lot of different ice-type varieties. From cube to half-cube to nugget type ice, self-contained units can be quite versatile. Some even have the option to switch between making different sized type ice, allowing the operator to choose between large or small cubes.As stated earlier, self-contained ice makers can come in a lot of output varieties. Some are meant to fit undercounter and are ADA certified, meaning they come in at height under 34 inches. This makes them especially useful for hospitals or retirement homes due to their ease of access. Since a self-contained ice machine doesn’t have a lot of extra pieces and peripheral parts, it’s often easier to install and also maintain throughout the years.Other Ice NeedsIce dispensers are popular in the commercial ice world. You see these types of machines in hospitals, schools, restaurants, and pretty much just about any other building that serves fountain-type drinks. Ice dispensers are fairly interesting because they often have a lot of other attributes. For instance, often time’s ice dispensers are also essentially ice storage. Ice dispensers can be standalone or modular, but regardless of their type, they generally work the same way. Ice is produced, stored in a component or bin and then dispensed when a customer or user wants ice. It’s not uncommon for these types of units to also dispense water or other types of beverages.A different type of ice storage type is a commercial ice merchandiser. Though this ice-themed unit doesn’t make ice, it’s used to store and display large amounts of ice, usually in bags. These units have to keep ice properly frozen and display them in an appealing manner for potential customers. Of course, sometimes these merchandisers have solid doors too. These ice merchandisers will generally be placed outside where is could potentially by sunny and hotter. The solid doors help keep out sunlight and heat from working against the merchandiser’s refrigeration.Check out some of the dependable commercial ice products on Ice Maker Direct.

Manitowoc News






Tuesday, July 25, 2017Barge-mounted MLC300 brings enhanced stability to Illinois bridge replacementWhen the Manitowoc MLC300 crawler crane debuted with Variable Position Counterweight (VPC) and VPC-MAX heavy lift attachment, one of its unique selling points was the crane’s barge-lifting capabilities. The reduced footprint and floating counterweight meant that it would be much more efficient for lifters to barge-mount a crawler crane. Contracting teams could erect the crane onto smaller water-based barges because the machine automatically adjusts its center of gravity for each lift.Tuesday, July 11, 2017In Florida power line erection, Grove GHC75 boosts efficiency to shorten schedule by two weeksNorth American companies are reaping the benefits of using Grove telescoping crawler cranes on a variety of jobs. Their combination of crawler maneuverability, telescoping boom versatility and 100 percent pick-and-carry capability is helping lifters increase efficiency on a wide variety of projects.Thursday, July 06, 2017Petro-Sea Logistics further bolsters its Grove all-terrain fleetPetro-Sea Logistics, a joint venture between Belgium’s Sea-Invest and Ivory Coast’s Petroci, began buying Grove all-terrain cranes in 2016, and that trend continues in 2017 with the addition of a GMK5180-1. The company made the switch from another brand’s all-terrain range and hasn’t turned back, thanks in part to the reliability of new Grove models, and especially for the aftermarket service that Manitowoc provides the company.Tuesday, July 04, 2017Three Potain MCT 85 cranes help deliver luxury residences in IndiaKolkata-based Indian real estate company PS Group is using three Potain MCT 85 topless cranes to help construct its much-anticipated residential project, PS Panache. Wednesday, June 28, 2017Potain and Grove cranes inspire sales at Turkish trade fair KomatekPotain and Grove cranes were showcased at international construction equipment trade fair, Komatek 2017, in Ankara, Turkey, this May. Manitowoc was represented at the show through two of its Turkish dealers, Istanbul-based TeknoVinç and Ankara-based Karun. Potain distributor, TeknoVinç, displayed a Hup 32-27 and a MDT 219 at the show, while Grove distributor, Karun, presented a GMK6300L.
