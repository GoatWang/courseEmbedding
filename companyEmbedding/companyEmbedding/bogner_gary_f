How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Bogner, Gary F carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Bogner, Gary F currently holds license 2101032074 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Bogner, Gary F



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Gary F. Bogner has been an avid hunter and wildlife conservationist for over 50 years. Born in Muskegon, Michigan in 1942, Gary graduated from Muskegon Heights High School in 1961. Growing up the son of a Michigan Game Conservation Officer, Gary quickly developed a deep love for the outdoors with and passion for archery that remains to this very day. By age 12, he was hunting small game and Michigan whitetail deer and by 17, he was running an area archery shop.
After his schooling, Gary went on to become a commercial pilot with Northwest Airlines during the period of government deregulation and airline cutbacks. Gary was elected by his fellow pilots to serve as their A.L.P.A. representative and councilman. He represented the Pilot’s Association through two airline mergers and three labor contracts. After 18 years of flying, he was forced to take a medical retirement. His flying experienced further gave him a greater appreciation of the diverse wildlife conservation issues throughout the country.
Gary obtained a Michigan real estate broker’s license and a general contractor’s license and after leaving the commercial air carrier business, he went on to pursue these areas of interest. He developed real estate through Western Michigan and has designed and built numerous commercial and residential properties as well as several manufactured housing communities. He currently owns and operates varied real estate properties, businesses and other investments.
Gary has actively served on numerous hospital committees, private corporate boards, and on the board of a public trading bank. He continued to be involved with charitable functions within his western Michigan community.
Gary has hunted five continents, harvested over 100 plus different species of big game animals with a bow. Gary was number 5 to complete the North America Super Slam of taking all 28 North America big game animals with a bow and with most qualifying for the record books. His travels have taken him to Africa where he became the first bow hunter to take the “Big Six” Elephant, Rhino, Hippo, Cape Buffalo, Lion and Leopard in a single safari.
In May 1991, Gary was the first bow hunter to travel to Russia to pioneer archery hunting and teaching the sport of bow hunting and Gary took a Russian Kamachatka Brown Bear and then later took a Marco Polo Sheep in Tajikistan at 15,000 plus feet. He has hunted with both compound and recurve bows. Gary feels that one of his biggest accomplishments is his taking of the first Marco Polo sheep of record in modern history with a bow at 15,000 plus feet.
Gary is a SCI/SCIF life member and has served two terms as President of the SCI/SCIF Board of Directors. He has served on numerous SCI committees and a past favorite being Chairman of the SCI Alternative Hunting and Archery Committee. Gary was President of the SCI World Bowhunters Chapter and served as a SCI Regional Representative. He is also a SCI Master Measurer.
Gary has shot Hoyt bows for over 15 years and has used Easton arrows for as long as he can remember. He also remembers in the beginning years making his arrows from many different things. He serves as a field advisor for numerous archery-manufacturing companies and also owns Arrowhead Adventures, Inc, which produces bow hunting adventure films. Gary also owns and operates Arrowhead Lodge a Whitetail Hunting Destination in Western Michigan. For more details see Arrowheadadventures.net.
Gary holds memberships in B&C, P&Y and life memberships in FNAW, IPHA, NRA, Elk Foundation, Grand Slam Club, Alaska, Michigan and Lone Star Bowhunters Associations, the Alaska, Wyoming and British Columbia Guides and Outfitters Association. However, his heart is dedicated to SCI, the conservation of wildlife and the protection of hunting. (SCI First For hunters). One of his strong beliefs is that all sportsmen must work to put back more than what they have taken and that wildlife is a renewable resource and hunting plays an important roll in wildlife management. He also believes that the heritage of hunting and its future depends on the sportsman and his actions. Gary encourages all sportsmen to work at preserving hunting and passing on the hunting tradition.
Gary and his wife Nanette, reside in Muskegon Michigan, and have three children and six grandchildren.
Acknowledgements
In 1995 Gary received the SCI World Bow Hunter’s Hall-Of-Honor Award for exhibiting the highest degree of integrity, success in the field and Lifetime Contribution To The Past And Future Growth of Bow Hunting and Archery.
In March 2002 a special honor was given to Gary during The 107th US Congress Session The Honorable James Barcia of Michigan in the U.S. House Of Representatives recognized and presented Gary with a reading of his Hunting And Archery Accomplishments into the Congressional Record and recognized him as the International Ambassador Of Bow Hunting.

Bowhunting For The North American Twenty-Eight:
Gary Bogner has had a remarkable career as hunter, for he has shot all species of North American game, and, to make it even more interesting, he has done so with a bow! And this was after he had hunted many of the same animals first with a rifle. We live in an age of hunting accomplishments, some say extreme accomplishments. But however you look at it, it must be admitted that hunting all North American big game with a bow has to be one of the most difficult things to do in the world of hunting.
All 
																			
																					Gary 
																			
																			’s hunts in the wild were fair chase; these include three hunts for a Stone sheep. He ultimately takes an incredible ram with his rifle and later comes back to get a very fine ram with his bow. And to top that, he hunted no less than four times to get his Dall ram. His description of getting his bighorn in 
																			
																					Canada 
																			
																			in deep snow makes one shiver with both the thoughts of the extreme cold as well as the idea of how difficult it is to get close enough to a wary animal like a bighorn to get a shot with a bow.
Ultimately 
																			
																					Gary 
																			
																			gets his chance at all twenty-eight: the caribou of the tundra, the moose of the boreal forests, and the deer of the farmlands and mountains. Even the giant bison fall to his arrow, along with puma, mountain goat, and the others. Almost no species were obtained in one try and many took three, four, or even six tries before he could bag his trophy. All big-game animals in 
																			
																				North America 
																			
																			are covered.

Africa 4 Renowned International Adventurer, Gary Bogner Is Back;









AFRICA IV 

Back In Africa For New Thrills And Spills, Hunting Some Of The Most Wary And Elusive Antelope On The Continent!

After a 4 year layover to preside over SCI, Gary Bogner has returned to the continent that captured his heart 11 years ago. For his fourth African adventure Gary has journeyed to the Arid Northern Cape Province of South Africa in search of the regions indigenous species, like the Springbok and Gemsbok. 

Armed with a new bow, improved arrows and that legendary Bogner attitude, Gary pits his wits against some of the most wary of African plains game. You are along for the adventure as Gary takes two of the rarest trophies taken throughout Africa, the exclusive Southern Roan and Exceptional Bontebok. Gary then demonstrates the patience required by all bowhunters waiting for the right animal, then the right moment to take a superb "Blue Bull" Cape Eland, the largest of the African Antelope. Gary does not have it all his own way though and a twilight shot on a Mountain Reedbuck leads to a few worrying moments trying to locate the trophy ram while South Africa's National animal, the Springbok, test Gary's nerves and the Black Wildebeest gives Gary one of the toughest hunts of his life. 

If you live to hunt or Africa has ever held your interest, this is one Bowhunting adventure you will not want to miss. This movie is proof that Africa offers everyone who hunts an adventure of a lifetime!

North America 1 & 2,







NORTH AMERICA

Ask any bowhunter what their fantasy hunt would be and you will likely hear: "the Griz" or "a monster bull moose". They may even say "a massive whitetail buck rattled in real close...or a rut-crazed bull elk" is a part of their hunting dreams. This is your chance to tag along on a hunt.

Join Gary Bogner as he takes you through a few seasons of his favorite North American bowhunts. You will catch a bone-deep chill while waiting out a huge grizzly bear in British Columbia. Survive, the upper North's sudden & bitter winter conditions, as Bogner hunts a giant bull moose at a mere 20 yards. And there is nothing like the action of being caught up in a caribou migration. In Passport to North America, you will find yourself right in the middle of one.

You will get so close to a rutting 6x6 bull elk, that you can almost smell it. If you love whitetail bucks, this video has 'em. Bogner hunts two big bucks during spot & stalk hunts in Texas Passport to North America has the same incredible camera action that makes Bogner's African documentaries so popular.

If hunting, adventure, and the splendor of North America's wildlife are your passions, this is your passport to the hunts of a lifetime.

NORTH AMERICA III

After more than 40 years of bowhunting, Gary Bogner still feels the thrill of the hunt as though every trip was his first. You will too as you experience the action in North America III. Riveting photography. Unpredictable weather. Mystical mountains. And a hunter's deadliest nightmare.

Go with Bogner beyond the reach of civilization as he searches for big game in the awe-inspiring and unforgiving Alaskan wilderness. Watch the hunters become the hunted when a giant brown bear focuses its attention from a kill to Bogner and his guide. Experience how it feels to come face-to-face with 1,000 pounds of fine-tuned killing machine.

Then, enjoy the quest for a ready-to-fight bull moose through a classic call, a perfect stalk, and a well-placed shot. See how Bogner gets the drop on a magnificent mule deer in the wide-open terrain of Montana's Big Sky Country. Plus, visit Bogner's version of "whitetail heaven," the King Ranch in Texas, where rattling draws incredible bucks that can vanish in the underbrush as quickly as they come in.



NORTH AMERICA lV

Join sportsman Gary Bogner in his attempt to complete the amazing North America Super Slam. This feat -- taking all 28 species of big game in North America -- has been accomplished by only four other bow hunters.

Lured to the Alaskan tundra by the Barren Ground Caribou, Bogner takes on one of the largest of the Caribou species. Watch him stalk an elusive Mountain Caribou in the Northwest Territory. And see why zero degrees, fog, and two feet of fresh snow in the Yukon in October give new meaning to less-than-perfect hunting conditions.

You'll see that years of bow-

hunting do not diminish Bogner's excitement as he takes a break to hunt his biggest whitetail ever on the King Ranch in Texas.

																									To complete his quest, Bogner chases the mysterious Coues Whitetail -- the grey ghost -- in the foothills of northern Sonora, Mexico. Watch what happens in the Blue Wilderness of Arizona when Bogner, wired and trembling in a tree stand, has his best chance to complete the Super Slam.

																									Gary Bogner's nothing-is-guaranteed approach to bowhunting is a refreshing change to traditional hunting videos. In bow hunting, just like in real life, dreams sometimes slip away. Great outfitters and pristine conditions do not always guarantee success. And there will be long rides back to camp with nothing to show. But to those bowhunters who are willing to climb to the next ridge or hunt until twilight...well, watch and enjoy. The End of a Quest is the beginning of a nearly perfect bowhunting adventure.

North America 5 & Whitetails of Arrowhead







NORTH AMERICA V

Hunting is much more than the pursuit or harvest of trophy animals. It's partly the memories, the stories, told over and over, and the adventures we seek. But there's the other important part of hunting so frequently overlooked; the development of friendships in the field. There is perhaps no greater place on earth to forge lasting friendships or traditions than in a hunting camp. And for most of us, our first real taste of hunting and the creation of true friendships involved deer hunting.

Gary Bogner's new Deer & Friends video is exactly that;

a real look at the bonds of friendship created while hunting deer. You get to share first-hand Gary's complete satisfaction of doing doing the thing he loves most...bowhunting deer with his friends.

At Gary's Arrowhead Lodge in Hesperia, Michigan, you can almost feel the bustle of wildlife and big whitetails. At the legendary King Ranch in Texas, Gary and one of his favorite buddies Butch Thompson rattle up a couple monster bucks.

And for a change of pace, Bogner and his close friend Jim Van Norman share a camp in the West's rugged mountains that mule deer call home. From the annual Montana family hunt Gary enjoys to his nerve-wracking stalks in Wyoming, the deer hunting action is non-stop.

So, kick back, pull off your boots, and invite a friend over. This video will put you back in your own favorite memories of deer hunting with friends.

Africa 1 & 2,







AFRICA

Join international adventurer Gary Bogner on his once in a lifetime bow hunting quest for the Big Six: Cape Buffalo, Lion, White Rhino, Hippo, Leopard, and Elephant.

Africa. The Dark Continent. The land of untamed wilderness and the world's toughest, most spectacular animals.

Imagine planning for two years and hunting for nearly two months -- to accomplish what no other bowhunter has ever done in a single trip.

This documentary takes you in close -- to the difficulty, the stalks, the endless days of heat, emotion and excitement, and to the inner circle of the most dangerous game animals in the world.

The spectacular camera work brings you within yards of three and a half tons of white rhino.

You'll feel yourself helping Bogner draw back on the Black Death - one of Africa's most feared animals, the Cape Buffalo, And follow behind Bogner as he spots and stalks the King of the Jungle. THis is truly an unforgettable video that should be a part of every bowhunter's collection.



AFRICA II

The Great Plains of Africa set the venue in Passport to Africa II. From stealth stalks on a wildebeest to an eye-opening standoff with a cape buffalo, feel your heart rate increase with every draw of the bow.

After international adventurer Gary Bogner completed the first ever successful bowhunt of all six of Africa's most dangerous game animals, he vowed he would return to the Dark Continent to pursue several species of elusive plains game animals and take on more of the deadly cape buffalo. Passport to Africa II is created in the same action-adventure style documentary as Passport to Africa I.

You'll see successful stalks on wildebeest, red hartebeest, the hyperactive klipspringer and regal gemsbok. Plus, a full-on charge from a "never say die" cape buffalo as it shows it is one of the most dangerous animals to hunt with bow and arrow.

Whether you've waited out whitetails or stalked in close to bull elk, you'll appreciate the camera work and over-the-shoulder action of Bogner's extra close encounters with Africa's toughest animals.

Africa 3 & New Zealand 







AFRICA III

																					They say Africa has a certain magnetism that draws you back, time and time again.

																					Such is the case with Gary Bogner, who returns for a third adventure to Zimbabwe at Peter and Carole Johnstone's Cawston Ranch.

																					With visions of the Africa that Teddy Roosevelt and Ernest Hemingway experienced, Gary is joined by his good friend and fellow archer, Jay Scholes.

																					Gary successfully hunts kudu, tsessebee and warthog, but it is Jay who surprises everyone, including himself. On only his second day in Africa, he hunts a huge sable bull, then 20 minutes later, he makes a perfect shot on a trophy kudu--a once in a lifetime feat captured on video.



NEW ZEALAND

Join international adventurer and world-class hunter Gary Bogner in the endless valleys, jagged ravines, and dense foliage of New Zealand.

From the rugged South Island, with its towering glacier-peaked mountains and mighty rivers, to the dense jungle-like foliage of the North Island, Bogner's quest for tahr, chamois, giant red stag, fallow deer, and feral sheep is an exciting adventure.

Hunt with Bogner for the elusive tahr, a goat-like animal that makes its home in the rocky bluffs and steep mountain faces of the South Island. Considered a trophy by hunters worldwide, the difficult-to-approach tahr bull can practically disappear into the rocks or the the thick grasses.

The high-county Chamois is hard to hunt with a rifle. Getting one with a band arrow is truly a hunting challenge.

If you get a rush when you hear an elk bugle, you'll thrill at the roar of the magnificent red stag. Reaching his limit at full draw, a trembling Bogner knocks down a beautiful 6x6 red stag with a well-placed shot through the dense brush while hunting at the Retaruke Estate.

Later, Bogner harvests another trophy red stag at the Wanganui Safaris on the North Island.

After proving that even world-class hunters can misjudge distances when shooting downhill, Bogner makes the most of a second chance at a mature fallow buck. Watch Bogner set his sights on a feral sheep--his difficult downhill shot at a trophy ram is right on the mark. Finally, sit in on a heart-to-heart talk with Bogner and his guide Paul Bamber, owner of Wanganui Safaris. You'll hear real-world tips about hunting, gear, and conservation from one of the world's most successful bow hunters.
