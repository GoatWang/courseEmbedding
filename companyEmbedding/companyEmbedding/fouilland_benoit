PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Criteo, 
      the global leader in performance 
      display advertising, today announced the appointment of Benoit 
      Fouilland as Chief Financial Officer. Fouilland joins from SAP where he 
      was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for the Europe, 
      Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. He was previously the Chief 
      Financial Officer of Business Objects, after having held successfully 
      several finance executive positions in the US and in Europe at Business 
      Objects. Prior to joining Business Objects, Fouilland worked at British 
      Telecom, initially driving international mergers and acquisition 
      transactions in the Corporate Development team and later as Vice 
      President venture operations and Chief Financial Officer for Asia 
      Pacific. He has worked and lived in Europe, Asia and the US.
    


      At SAP, Benoit was responsible for managing all financial activities and 
      for driving the growth and profitability strategies for the EMEA region, 
      which contributed to approximately half of SAP group revenues. At 
      Business Objects he has been instrumental in scaling the company for 
      growth and in managing the requirements of the dual public quoting on 
      NASDAQ and EURONEXT Paris.
    

“Benoit is a fantastic addition to Criteo’s management team, bringing 
      with him a wealth of experience and a proven track record. He joins a 
      talented leadership and we believe that he will help to accelerate the 
      exceptional growth that we have seen over the last couple of years,” 
      said Dominique Vidal, Board Director of Criteo and partner at Index 
      Ventures.


“Benoit has the entrepreneurial spirit that we are looking for from 
      all of our employees. It is not just about the wealth of experience that 
      he brings, but the way in which he has constructed his career. He 
      searches out opportunities to make a difference and we are glad that he 
      will have an opportunity to do that here with us at Criteo,” adds JB 
      Rudelle, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder.


“This is a great opportunity for me to further my career with a 
      company that is shaping the future of the advertising industry. Criteo 
      also has a culture of innovation within its DNA which is evident in its 
      people across the organisation. I look forward to the joining a 
      dedicated team and building on an impressive list of recent successes,” 
      Fouilland concludes.


      Benoit holds a masters degree in business administration from INSEAD in 
      Fontainebleau, France as well as a post graduate degree in Finance from 
      Université Paris Dauphine and a diploma from the ESLSCA Graduate School 
      of Business in Paris.

All rights reserved.  Q1 2017 ResultsTranscriptEuroBusiness Media (EBM): Performance marketing technology company Criteo has just announced its first quarter results. I'm joined by Criteo CFO Benoit Fouilland. Benoit, thanks for being with us. Another strong quarter for Criteo. Tell us more about it. Benoit Fouilland: Indeed we had another great quarter. We delivered rapid profitable growth and healthy cash flow. All of this while investing across the business. This is a combination that makes our model attractive and differentiated. We exceeded our guidance for the 14th consecutive quarter. Revenue ex-TAC grew 30%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 18% and free cash flow more than doubled growing 136%.EBM: So what were the main drivers of your success? Benoit Fouilland: We had 3 key drivers: innovation, access to inventory, and client addition. We delivered on our innovation roadmap driving 15% growth of same-client revenue ex-TAC. In the engine, we made enhancements to Kinetic Design - our creative layer - driving revenue ex-TAC uplift of 3-5 % and we rolled out a new engine feature that allows clients to bid on the cost of sales target driving an average 5 % uplift in sales for the clients who adopted it. Also our User Graph gained more power with now 67% of revenue ex-TAC generated from matched users. We continued to build the graph through CRM and third party data and a new probabilistic technology. Our clients are getting increasing value from this graph. For example we launched a service for clients to use our graph in their own attribution tools.EBM: Tell us more about the other two drivers you mentioned? Benoit Fouilland: So we expanded and improved our access to inventory. We completed the testing of our header bidding technology, now connected to over 100 publishers and driving positive results for clients, publishers and for us. Native inventory continues to show good traction, now representing over one quarter of our business. And in video we are pleased with the early results of our alpha testing with several large clients. And we added over 950 net new clients while maintaining 90% client retention rate across the business. Midmarket now represent 32% of revenue ex-TAC and it remains a huge opportunity for us. EBM: You recently launched two new products, tell us how they're doing? Benoit Fouilland: So with Criteo Sponsored Products we are working on the technology integration with the Criteo Engine. We signed several large publishers including Walgreens in the U.S. and we expanded the product in Europe signing new brands like Samsung and Electrolux. And with Criteo Predictive Search, we are still assessing the potential market for our product. U.S. retailers continue to show interest in our product and we see good client satisfaction. So we launched in France at the end of Q1 and started signing large clients.  EBM: What are your priorities for the year ahead? Benoit Fouilland: So for 2017 we remain focused on a clear set of priorities. First, innovate on the core product and expand our core business worldwide. Second, scale Criteo Sponsored Product across markets and integrate it with the Criteo technology. Third, deploy Criteo Predictive Search in the U.S., in France and in additional key markets. Fourth, build and leverage our pooled assets like our User Graph, our Universal Catalog, and sales attribution for brands across retailer partners. All of that in order to benefit our ecosystem. And fifth, develop, test, launch compelling new products such as prospecting, app installs, offline CRM data onboarding and video. EBM: So all in all another great quarter for you… Benoit Fouilland: Yes. I'm pleased with our strong performance in Q1 delivering sustained profitable growth and cash flow. We execute on our plans and we see exciting avenues of growth for 2017 and beyond. EBM: Benoit Fouilland, Criteo's CFO, thanks for being with us. Benoit Fouilland: Thank you.

All rights reserved.  Q1 2016 ResultsTranscriptEuroBusiness Media (EBM): Criteo, the performance marketing technology company, reports Q1 results for 2016. Here to talk about those results and the outlook for the year ahead is the company’s chief financial officer, Benoît Fouilland. Benoît, thanks for being with us today. Now Criteo just posted another strong quarter. Can you tell us a bit more about it?Benoît Fouilland: Yes, we had another strong quarter of profitable growth. We exceeded guidance for the tenth consecutive quarter on both revenue ex-TAC and adjusted EBIDTA. Innovation on focused execution has fuelled our growth again. We grew revenue ex-TAC 41% at constant currency while we’ve been growing adjusted EBITDA at 56% at constant currency. So rapid growth and expanding profitability are really, truly distinct features of our business model.EBM: Tell us, Benoît, what were the main achievements then in Q1?Benoît Fouilland: In fact we performed well in all dimensions of our business. We rolled out innovation to all devices on all platforms. We had also our second largest quarter in terms of net client add and we continued to expand our relationship with publishers. Let me start with technology innovation. Mobile is driving more than 50% of our business and within mobile, in-apps is growing very fast. Our Universal Match Solution is enduring great momentum. And what we are observing is that users that we’ve matched before are in fact the ones who are the most valuable to us. We are generating more than 40% of our revenue ex-TAC from those users. Our first dynamic creative platform is now rolled out to all clients. As a result of this innovation, our existing clients generated 21% more revenue ex-TAC than they did a year ago. On the new client side, we added over 760 new clients in Q1. All of that while maintaining a high retention rate at 90%. Mid-market remains a very large opportunity. We believe we have only penetrated at 15% today. And we have seen mid-market growing over 80% in Q1. And all of that with the revenue ex-TAC per client which continues to grow nicely in the mid-market. And finally on publisher we have now, today, close to 5,000 clients live on DPA, on Facebook, both on mobile and desktop. Native continues to show very positive traction during the quarter and we’ve made some good progress on the in-apps side, particularly in mobile first markets.EBM: Today you were talking us through the performance business by business, what would you say then about the regional performance of the company in Q1?Benoît Fouilland: So let’s start with the Americas. The Americas grew 48% at constant currency in Q1 and Americas was the largest contributor to the growth in Q1 among the three regions. We’ve seen some solid growth from existing clients and on the new clients side we have signed several large clients in the quarter, including 3 among the top 100 in retail on travel in the US. Mid-market has been continuing to grow very fast at close to 100%. Let’s talk about EMEA now. So EMEA has been growing at 30% at constant currency in Q1, which is higher than what we expected, in fact we did well on all levels. On the large clients, mid-market as well as on the new, on existing clients. And we’ve seen continued double digit growth in the established market in EMEA. Finally, in Asia Pacific, we have been growing at 52% at constant currency. We’ve seen some strong traction from new business in Japan and South East Asia in particular. South East Asia, we are continuing to grow at triple digit rate in Q1. And finally, our Chinese export business has been accelerating.EBM: Looking ahead then, tell us a bit about what you are focused on for the rest of 2016. Benoît Fouilland: We remain focused on our four core priorities for the year. Our first priority is to innovate on our core product, in particular in our Universal Match Solution. The user graph that we are building is becoming a true strategic asset for Criteo. Second is to expand a great new source of inventory, with specific focus on social, native and in-app. Thirdly, to grow Asia. Asia Pac is a very important region for us and we want to grow our presence across South East Asia, India, where we are opening a subsidiary this quarter, as well as China. And, finally, fourth is to continue to develop disruptive new products. We are investing and making good progress and we remain very excited by the search opportunity.EBM: Before we go then do you want to make a few comments to conclude what you’ve just told us?Benoît Fouilland: Yes, in short, I’m pleased with the Q1 result.
