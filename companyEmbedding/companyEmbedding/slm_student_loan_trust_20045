                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Takes Various Rating Actions on SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-5 Notes | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Takes Various Rating Actions on SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-5 Notes
    





June 09, 2016 05:20 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings takes the following rating actions on SLM Student Loan 
      Trust Series
    


      2004-5 (SLM 2004-5) senior and subordinate notes:
    

      --Class A-4 notes affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5 notes affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-6 notes at 'AAAsf'; Rating Watch Negative maintained;
    

      --Class B notes affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The Rating Watch Negative action on the class A-6 notes of the SLM 
      2004-5 trust is due to their inability to pass cash flow stresses 
      necessary to maintain their current ratings of 'AAAsf'. On Dec. 4, 2015, 
      Fitch released its exposure draft which delineates revisions it plans to 
      make to the 'Rating U.S. Federal Family Education Loan Program Student 
      Loan ABS Criteria', dated June 23, 2014. This transaction was reviewed 
      under both the existing criteria and exposure draft. Fitch expects to 
      resolve the Rating Watch Negative status once its revised FFELP criteria 
      report is published.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Collateral Quality: The trust collateral consists of 100% of Federal 
      Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans. The credit quality of the 
      trust collateral is high, in Fitch's opinion, based on the guarantees 
      provided by the transaction's eligible guarantors and reinsurance 
      provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for at least 97% of 
      principal and accrued interest. Fitch currently rates the U.S. 'AAA' 
      with a Stable Outlook.
    

      Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by 
      overcollateralization (OC; the excess of trust's asset balance over bond 
      balance), excess spread, and for the senior notes, subordination is 
      provided by the subordinate notes. As of March 2016, senior and 
      subordinate parities are 104.83% (4.60% CE) and 100.00%, respectively. 
      The trust may release cash as long as the total parity of 100.0% is 
      maintained.
    

      Liquidity Support: Liquidity support is provided by a debt service 
      reserve account sized at the greater of 0.25% of the pool balance and 
      $4,455,445. As of March 2016, the debt service reserve account is sized 
      at $4,455,445.
    

      Servicing Capabilities: Navient Solutions, Inc. (formerly, Sallie Mae, 
      Inc.), as servicer, will be responsible for the day to day servicing of 
      the portfolio. Fitch believes Navient Solutions to be an acceptable 
      servicer of FFELP student loans.
    

      In certain LIBOR-down interest rate stress scenarios the basis spread 
      may be compressed, as Fitch would apply a floor to
    

      1-month LIBOR at a negative rate level in accordance with Fitch's 
      "Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions 
      and Covered Bonds" dated May 2016. Since the updated interest rate 
      stresses are not addressed yet in existing FFELP criteria, this 
      represents a criteria variation. Use of the criteria variation did not 
      have a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned.
    

      Under Fitch's "Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds", dated May 14, 2014, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analysing 
      counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The 
      definition of permitted investments for this deal allows possibility of 
      using investments not rated by Fitch, which represents a criteria 
      variation. Since the only available funds to invest in are those held in 
      the collection account, and the funds can only be invested for a short 
      duration of three months given the payment frequency of the notes, Fitch 
      doesn't believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings 
      assigned.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since FFELP student loan ABS rely on the U.S. government to reimburse 
      defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem with the 
      'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign rating, 
      defaults, basis risk, and loan extension risk account for the majority 
      of the risk embedded in FFELP student loan transactions. Additional 
      defaults, basis shock beyond Fitch's published stresses, lower than 
      expected payment speed, and other factors could result in future 
      downgrades. Likewise, a build-up of CE driven by positive excess spread 
      given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future upgrades.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was not provided due diligence information from any third parties 
      relating to the transaction.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
