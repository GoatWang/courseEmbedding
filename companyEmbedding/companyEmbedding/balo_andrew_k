DexCom, Inc. (DXCM) Raised to “Hold” at Zacks Investment Research

					Posted by Tristan Rich on Jul 21st, 2017 // No Comments 




Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research note published on Tuesday. 
According to Zacks, “In the past one year, DexCom has underperformed the broader industry in terms of price. Furthermore, a disappointing estimate revision trend indicates looming concerns ahead. DexCom reported narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter. We believe the company’s margins will continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters owing to high product development costs and rising expenditures on research & development. Specifically, the company is expected to have lower margins on transmitter sales (in spite of the cost reduction initiatives). Additionally, cutthroat competition in the market for blood glucose monitoring devices is a major headwind. On the positive side, the glucose monitoring market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom. The company has also signed collaborative agreements with several companies, which should not only bring in cash but also help expand its product portfolio.”
