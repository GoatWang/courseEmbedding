Vycor Medical Inc. Signs Agreement With HEALTHSOUTH For Second NovaVision Therapy Product  











Tweet








6/8/2015 6:39:58 AM


BOCA RATON, Florida, June 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Vycor Medical, Inc. ("Vycor") (OTCQB: VYCO), a provider of innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions, announced that it has entered into an agreement with HealthSouth Corporation (HLS) to make available its NeuroEyeCoach Professional Center therapy program to participating HealthSouth hospitals, following a 3-month trial of the therapy in two HealthSouth locations.NeuroEyeCoach is NovaVision's eye movement compensation therapy for those patients who have suffered a cerebral visual field disorder as a result of a stroke or brain injury and is designed to improve a patient's ability to scan their environment more efficiently. The program is based on several decades of scientific research pioneered by Professor Josef Zihl at the Max Planck Institute in Munich that has been the subject of numerous clinical studies. Participating HealthSouth hospitals will use the program to treat patients while in their care. In contrast to other clinic-based saccadic programs, NeuroEyeCoach is a full-course therapy dedicated to cerebral visual field disorders and can be continued by the patient in their home environment.This agreement follows the approval by HealthSouth in late 2014 to make available its VIDIT diagnostic to their hospital network and NovaVision is installing devices into this network. The NovaVision VIDIT is the diagnostic component of the Company's Vision Restoration Therapy (VRT) and is used to perform high-resolution visual field tests to screen for central visual field deficits commonly associated with stroke or brain injury. The ability for Health South physicians to be able to quickly identify visual disorders through the effective screening program is highlighted by the fact that approximately one-third of stroke or other brain injury patients suffer from a neurologically induced visual disorder and if this deficit goes undetected it may adversely impact other rehabilitation modalities. Early detection and treatment are critical steps towards improving overall patient care, a key objective of HealthSouth. Once diagnosed, patients are able to be treated in-clinic with NeuroEyeCoach and referred to NovaVision for treatment following discharge at home using VRT, which is the only FDA cleared clinically supported therapy targeted at the restoration of lost vision resulting from neurological brain damage such as that resulting from stroke.HealthSouth (www.healthsouth.com) is one of the largest providers of post-acute healthcare services in the U.S. These two agreements therefore provide NovaVision with a source of installation and rental income but equally as important is a potentially large source of patients; most stroke patients will touch a rehabilitation center at some point and HealthSouth is the largest network of stroke rehabilitation hospitals in the U.S.This announcement follows NovaVision's press release in March that it had completed development of VRT 7.0, re-engineering the therapy to be internet-delivered and streamlining business process to enable a significant reduction in cost to the patient. NovaVision will provide VRT and NeuroEyeCoach in one therapy suite. NovaVision will very shortly be commencing accepting patients with the new therapy suite which is considered by management to be the most affordable, clinically supported, comprehensive therapy suite available on the market to address visual disorders arising from stroke or brain injury.About Vycor Medical, Inc.With corporate headquarters in Boca Raton, FL, Vycor Medical, Inc. ("Vycor") is a publicly traded company (OTCQB: VYCO) dedicated to providing the medical community with innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions and has a growing portfolio of FDA cleared medical solutions that are changing and improving lives every day. The Company operates two business units: Vycor Medical and NovaVision, both of which adopt a minimally or non-invasive approach. Both technologies have exceptional sales growth potential, address large potential markets, have the requisite regulatory approvals and are commercialized and generating revenue. Vycor Medical's ViewSite Surgical Access Systems (VBAS) is a suite of clear cylindrical minimally invasive disposable devices that hold the potential for speedier, safer and more economical brain surgeries and a quicker patient discharge.  VBAS is designed to optimize neurosurgical site access, reduce patient risk, accelerate recovery and add tangible value to the professional medical community. The company is ISO 13485:2003 compliant, has U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance for brain and spine surgeries and full regulatory approvals for brain in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe (EU  Class III), Korea and Japan and is seeking or has partial regulatory approvals in India, Russia, Taiwan and Vietnam. For an overview of Vycor Medical's VBAS see VBAS Video.NovaVision develops and provides science-driven neurostimulation therapy and other medical technologies that help improve and partially restore sight in patients with neurological vision impairments. The company's proprietary Visual Restoration Therapy® (VRT) platform is clinically supported to improve lost vision resulting from stroke, traumatic brain injury ("TBI"), or other acquired brain injuries. VRT is the only FDA 510K cleared medical device in the U.S. aimed at the restoration of vision for neurologically induced vision loss and can be prescribed by any physician. VRT also has CE Marking for the EU. NovaVision also provides Neuro Eye Therapy (NeET) in the EU, aimed at increasing visual sensitivity deep within the field defect. The Company has also developed NeuroEyeCoach, a therapy which is highly complementary to VRT. The two therapies address different visual disabilities each of which results from neurologically-induced vision loss  a loss of visual field as well as difficulty with eye movement, affecting the ability to integrate visual information. VRT provides partial restoration of the patient's lost visual field; NeuroEyeCoach is designed to increase the efficiency of eye movement and re-train the patients' ability to integrate visual information between the left and right hand side. For an overview of NovaVision see NovaVision Video.For the latest information on the company, including media and other coverage, and to learn more, please go online at www.vycormedical.com, www.vycorvbas.com or www.novavision.com.Vycor Medical, Inc Contacts:6401 Congress Avenue Suite 140Boca Raton, FL. 33487+1(561)-558-2020info@vycormedical.comTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vycor-signs-agreement-with-healthsouth-for-second-novavision-therapy-product-300095371.htmlSOURCE  Vycor Medical, Inc.

Vycor Medical, Inc.












Peter Zachariou , 
                    CEO
Our core philosophy is to bring to market devices and therapies that address significant needs across multiple disciplines by working directly with and through the best minds in the healthcare community from around the world. Our products and services are designed to advance the health and well being of people worldwide.






1. What's the core philosophy of Vycor Medical in designing, developing and delivering the neurosurgical and neuro-therapeutic solutions?
Our core philosophy is to bring to market devices and therapies that address significant needs across multiple disciplines by working directly with and through the best minds in the healthcare community from around the world. Our products and services are designed to advance the health and well being of people worldwide.
All our products and therapies are evidence based, what I mean by that is that they are supported by rigorous clinical data they are designed to be minimally invasive and have regulatory clearances such as FDA and CE marking.
 2. What has Vycor Medical got to offer for patients suffering from vision loss due to neurological trauma?
Substantial numbers of Americans therefore suffer from a visual disability resulting from neurological brain damage. The impact on their daily lives is dramatic, and is the difference between a person being able to be home alone, cross the road unaided, drive, shop or read. NovaVision's portfolio of therapies is specifically targeted to help these people, to both restore and compensate for this type of vision disability. Our therapies are designed to be done in the comfort of the patients home however we also have clinic based professional models. The benefits of the products can best be understood by reading the many testimonials we have. We recently had one of our patients Carole give her life changing experience on several radio stations, she is one of many patients that were told by their physician that there was nothing that could be done for them, and were even sceptical of our therapy, but thankfully she never gave up hope and after her 6 month treatment she regained 91 % of her vision.
 3.  What are Vycor Medical's recent advances in manufacturing computer-based light stimulation therapies?
We have recently launched our web deliverable therapies consisting of both our lead Vision Restoration Therapy and in the same therapy suite we also have our newly developed NeuroEyeCoach Compensation Therapy that complements our VRT.
Restoration: aims at improving visual sensitivity within the blind area by repeated stimulation, allowing patients to detect objects within the blind field. Examples of this type of therapy include NovaVision’s Vision Restoration Therapy (VRT) which is the only FDA Cleared therapy to our knowledge targeted at the restoration of lost vision from brain damage such as that resulting from Stroke.
Compensation: patients learn to direct their gaze towards the affected area bringing previously unseen objects into sight thereby allowing the patient to make the most of their remaining vision. NeuroEyeCoach is an example of this type of therapy
4. What is the significance of the product, 'NovaVision Web Deliverable Therapy Suite'?
The new web deliverable therapy suite that has just been launched is priced at $900 that is affordable to the masses. We believe this is the most affordable clinically supported comprehensive therapy suite available on the market to address visual disorders from neurological brain damage.
 5. How does Vycor Medical strive to produce robust yet affordable solutions for neurologically induced visual disorders?
The first point to note is that everything we do is rigorously clinically supported. We achieve this by working closely with our world-class scientific advisors and other physicians familiar with our products. Once the product is agreed, we have then been focused on how to deliver that product at the lowest cost to the patient. In this case through the internet delivery we have managed to largely eliminate the hardware costs otherwise inherent and pass on those cost savings to the patients.
 6. How did Vycor gain the trust of Healthcare providers for ensuring safety and precision with the use of its medical devices?
Firstly our products are FDA Cleared. This means that they have gone through a substantial development program carefully controlled by Vycor’s robust quality systems that are then maintained to ensure safety and efficacy monitoring of our products.
Secondly both of our businesses have a wealth of clinical data that supports our products. VRT has over 20 clinical studies, NeuroEyeCoach is supported by 13 clinical studies and our VBAS has 7 peer -reviewed papers demonstrating its superiority.
7. How does Vycor work to collaborate with NovaVision in developing future products?
Just to be clear I assume you are asking how management of Vycor interacts with NovaVision in their new product development. Management evaluates all ideas that originate from NovaVision, its scientific advisors or outside physicians to try and identify potential new products and product extensions. We typically work with direct scientific input, as well as a dedicated development team.
8. What does the recent HealthSouth-Vycor agreement mean to patients in the network hospitals?
HealthSouth trialed both our Vidit Diagnostic product and NeuroEyeCoach therapy center model product for many months in several sites and collected feedback. On the basis of the feedback HealthSouth approved our products to be made available in their network.
We have placed VIDIT and NeuroEyeCoach products with several HealthSouth hospitals and are now actively marketing them through the HealthSouth network.
The significance of this strategy is that most patients who have suffered a stroke or significant traumatic brain injury will touch a rehab center as an inpatient or outpatient at some time and that is the universe of patients that are eligible for our therapies.
Looking beyond HealthSouth, there are other rehabilitation chains in the US which also may be interested in providing more focused vision rehabilitation treatments. NovaVision stands ready to service those other chains also
9. With an estimated $4 billion market potential for NovaVision’s therapies in the US and Europe, what are your plans for the emerging markets?
We have just launched this product offering so initially it makes sense for us to focus our efforts on the areas where we have a physical presence namely the US and Europe which as you say are large opportunities in their own right. We have patent protection in a number of emerging markets and will be focusing in on those markets in due course.
10. What are the challenges that Vycor Medical aims to solve for the medical community under your leadership in the coming years?
To become the standard of care for the markets we are currently addressing and to broaden the areas of focus into new related areas.
Our neurosurgical division currently provides a solution for retraction of brain tissue and access to surgical sites in the brain. However, we have 510k clearance for spine and we see potential to provide solutions for retraction of delicate tissue and access to surgical sites elsewhere in the body.
We intend to make NovaVision the standard of care for vision loss from stroke or brain injury, but also use the great delivery platform we have now built to provide therapies for other issues suffered by these patients, such as reading and cognitive training.

Vycor Medical Inc. To Unveil VBAS Product Line Extension And Prototypes At CNS 65th Annual Meeting In New Orleans, September 26-30, 2015  











Tweet








9/28/2015 12:43:18 PM


BOCA RATON, Florida, September 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --

Vycor Medical, Inc. ("Vycor") (OTCQB: VYCO), a provider of innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions, will introduce its ViewSite™ Brain Access System (VBAS) product line extension and prototypes at the 2015 Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) Annual Meeting. The event will be held at Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans September 26-30, 2015.

Attendees may visit the company's booth (#611) to learn about its two new ViewSite TC model devices that are half the diameter of VBAS smallest devices. The devices were developed in close collaboration with a leading neurosurgeon, who identified a need for a much smaller VBAS than those currently available to allow less invasive surgery yet still enable the use of instruments such as endoscopes. The smaller size also enables minimally invasive approaches to areas where existing retractors are too potentially invasive, such as the ventricles. The company expects the devices to be commercially available in the fourth quarter of this year.

Peter Zachariou, CEO of Vycor, commented: "The VBAS product line extension allows us to better address under-served neurosurgical needs in the market and is consistent with our stated objective of adding new product variations to our core VBAS product line. Given the devices' extremely small dimensions and smooth shape, we believe the product features represent a significant step forward in minimally invasive brain access and retraction. We see our two new devices helping us address an estimated 25,000 procedures in the U.S. which were previously un-addressable by Vycor's existing VBAS product line."

Vycor will also showcase at its booth a finalized pre-manufacturing prototype of a set of four VBAS devices designed to be integrated with selected Image Guided Systems (IGS). Management strongly believes that the existing VBAS rigid structure lends itself well to being incorporated into the increasing trend of IGS surgery. The products being displayed were developed in conjunction with input from both a leading neurosurgeon and a strategic company that is a leader in the image guidance space. The company plans to launch the products in the second half of 2016.

In addition, neurosurgeons from the Department of Neurological Surgery, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York will discuss at the Vycor booth the clinical advantages of using VBAS. Management believes that continued high quality clinical data supporting the superiority and benefits of its VBAS product line over traditional retractors will help accelerate its adoption and help make it the future standard of care.

The VBAS was selected to be on the cover of the March edition of the prestigious Journal of Neurosurgery (JNS). Founded in 1944, the Journal of Neurosurgery is recognized by neurosurgeons and related medical specialists worldwide for its authoritative and cutting-edge clinical articles, laboratory research papers, case reports, literature reviews, technical notes, book reviews and more. The Journal of Neurosurgery is cited more often than any other journal dedicated to the field of neurosurgery. In total, there have been five peer reviewed clinical papers published on VBAS in 2015 alone. VBAS is now approved in over 200 hospitals in the U.S. and the number continues to grow. To date, more than 10,000 surgeries have utilized VBAS.

The CNS Annual Meeting is the premier forum for exploring controversial and hot-button issues impacting the neurosurgical specialty and for learning about the most cutting-edge procedures, approaches, and technologies in the field.

Vycor Medical, Inc. is dedicated to providing the medical community with innovative and superior neurosurgical and neurotherapeutic solutions. Vycor is guided by a pre-eminent world class Scientific Advisory Team and the Company has a growing portfolio of FDA-cleared medical solutions that are changing lives every day. Vycor Medical operates two distinct but complementary business units. Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. NovaVision develops non-invasive, computer-based light stimulation therapies for those suffering from vision loss resulting from neurological trauma such as stroke.
Vycor Medical’s VBAS is a medical device committed to making neurological brain, spinal and other surgical procedures safer and more effective. Vycor’s innovative medical instruments are designed to optimize neurosurgical site access, reduce patient risk, accelerate recovery and add tangible value to the professional medical community.
Vycor Medical’s ViewSite Brain Access System (VBAS) is a suite of clear cylindrical disposable devices used to access target sites such as tumors within the brain which provide both retraction and a stable working channel during neurosurgery for their removal. The FDA 510(k) cleared system provides a minimally invasive approach into the brain, offering clinical advantages that have been validated in various peer-reviewed articles and have enabled previously inoperable procedures to take place, thereby saving and changing lives.
NovaVision provides vision solutions targeted at a substantial and largely un-addressed market of people who have lost their sight as a result of Stroke or Traumatic Brain Injury (neurological brain damage). NovaVision has a family of therapies that both restore lost vision and help to compensate for lost vision and which complement each other to maximize patient benefit.
While other rehabilitation modalities such as speech, physical and occupational therapy have been considered a standard of care for stroke and traumatic brain injury there has to date not been any way of comprehensively addressing lost vision. NovaVision’s Visual Restoration Therapy (VRT) and Sight Science’s (NeET) are developed to increase the sensitivity within the blind areas while Novavision’s NeuroEyeCoach (NEC) Therapy is a compensation technique based on over 4 decades of scientific research that is designed to teach patients to direct the gaze towards the affected area bringing previously undetected objects into sight. NovaVision has operations in the US, Germany and UK.
The Vycor Vision
