Explanation of Responses:

1. Effective January 8, 2016, WKCAX, a mutual fund portfolio for which Clinton Group, Inc. ("CGI") acted as sub-advisor, distributed in-kind, in connection with the winding up of WKCAX, shares of Imation Corp. held by it to GEH Capital, Inc. ("GEHC"), a shareholder of WKCAX and an affiliate of CGI. The aggregate number of shares beneficially owned by Mr. George E. Hall ("Mr. Hall") remains unchanged.

2. The securities reported on this line may be deemed to be indirectly beneficially owned by CGI, which securities are directly held by Clinton Relational Opportunity Master Fund, L.P. ("CREL"), Clinton Magnolia Master Fund, Ltd. ("CMMF") and a mutual fund portfolio ("CASF"). CGI is deemed to be the indirect beneficial owner of such securities by virtue of its position as investment manager of CMMF and its ownership of Clinton Relational Opportunity, LLC, which serves as the investment manager of CREL, and sub-advisory agreements governing CASF. Mr. Hall serves as the Chief Executive Officer of CGI. Mr. Hall is deemed to be the indirect beneficial owner of such securities by virtue of his direct and indirect control of CGI.

3. For purposes of Rule 16a-1(a)(2) of the 1934 Act, each of the Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of such securities, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that any Reporting Person is the beneficial owners of the securities for the purpose of Section 16 or for any other purpose, except to the extent of such Reporting Person's pecuniary interest therein. Mr. Joseph A. DePerio ("Mr. DePerio") is an employee of CGI and serves as a member of the board of directors of the Issuer. Mr. DePerio submits his Section 16 filings independent of CGI. CGI disclaims beneficial ownership of any and all securities beneficially owned by Mr. DePerio.

4. The securities reported on this line may be deemed to be indirectly beneficially owned by Mr. Hall, which securities are directly held by GEHC. Mr. Hall is deemed to be the indirect beneficial owner of such securities by virtue of his indirect ownership of GEHC.
Remarks:
Because Mr. DePerio, an employee of CGI, serves as a member of the board of directors of the Issuer, each of the Reporting Persons may be deemed to be a director by deputization.
