RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) Risk: Investing in MBS entails various risks, including credit risks inherent in the underlying collateral, the risk that the servicer fails to perform its duties, liquidity risks, interest rate risks, structure risks, and geographical concentration risks.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Limited Term Risk: It is anticipated that the fund will terminate and liquidate its assets and return the proceeds to its shareholders on or before a specific date, although it could terminate sooner or later under certain conditions.  The fund may be required to sell portfolio securities at times when market conditions are not favorable, negatively affecting its value.Hedging Risk: The fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes, but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful.  Derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount invested.MBS Prepayment Risk: MBS represent an interest in a pool of mortgages. These mortgages typically permit borrowers to prepay amounts owing, often with no penalty.  In periods of falling interest rates, the rate of prepayments tends to increase, forcing a fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.  However, prepayment risk for a MBS may not be the same as call risk for a corporate bond of similar maturity, making this risk difficult to estimate.Illiquid Securities Risk: The fund may not be able to sell securities in its portfolio at the time or price the fund desires.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






†† Cash-flow Based Distribution

				Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. You should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.
			

				Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.

HARP Loan















Advertorial

What is the HARP Program?
When you have little equity in your home, or owe as much or more on your mortgage than your home is worth, it can be difficult to find a lender willing to help you refinance.
                            But for borrowers who have remained current on their mortgages, and have loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is hope. It’s called Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).
                        
Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                            HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies over the 12 months prior to refinancing.







Significant changes have been made to HARP since the program was first introduced. For example, in 2011 the LTV ceiling was removed, property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances, certain risk fees for borrowers
                            selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated, and certain representations and warranties were waived. In 2013, the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by Fannie Mae                            or Freddie Mac to the date on the note, increasing the pool of eligible borrowers.
                        
Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month), get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate
                            mortgage. There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.
                        
And now that HARP guidelines are simpler, even people who were formerly turned down may now be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                        
Find out if you qualify for HARP!




How can HARP help me?
If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing. That can mean significant savings
                            by: 

Lowering your monthly payment
Reducing your interest rate
Securing a fixed-rate mortgage that won’t change over time
Building equity faster—shorter term options may be available
Lower closing costs because an appraisal is not usually required
Check your HARP eligibility‎!





HARP program includes:


No underwater limits
Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value. Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                


No appraisals or underwriting
Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten, making their refinance process smoother and faster.


Modified fees
Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.


Less paperwork
Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification, and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower has at least 12 months
                                    of mortgage payments in reserve.


Program Deadline
The end date to get a HARP refinance is September 30, 2017.


Check if you qualify for HARP before it's gone!






Might you be eligible?
See if you meet these basic eligibility requirements:

You are current on your mortgage, with no 30-day+ late payments in the last six months and no more than one in the past 12 months
Your home is your primary residence, a 1-unit second home or a 1- to 4-unit investment property.
Your loan is owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. You can use the Loan Look-up Tools below if you are unsure.
Your loan was originated on or before May 31, 2009.
Your current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio must be greater than 80%.
Verify your HARP eligibility now‎!











Gather your financial information
Make sure you have your basic financial and loan information on hand when you call your mortgage company. You’ll need:

Your mortgage statements, including information on a second mortgage (if applicable).
Your income details (paystub or income tax return).
