• A true partnership carefully designed with a “built to  last” mindset and seeking the utmost degree of alignment of interest between  investors and Squadra´s partners. 
• Shareholders invest significant personal capital  alongside with investors.
 
 Investment Philosophy
Search for significant price distortions 
• 	We intend to invest in companies which market prices are considerably different from intrinsic value (margin of safety concept). 
Absolute return oriented  
• We intend to invest in companies that offer risk adjusted returns above the long term opportunity cost in Brazil.
•	We avoid indexation bias.
Long term oriented
•	We look for investments with mid and long term visibility.

Advertência



			- O fundo de investimento não conta com a garantia da administradora, da gestora, de qualquer mecanismo de seguro ou, ainda, do Fundo Garantidor de Créditos (FGC).	
			- A rentabilidade obtida no passado não representa garantia de rentabilidade futura. A rentabilidade divulgada não é líquida de impostos.
			- Este fundo de cotas aplica em fundo de investimento que utiliza estratégias com derivativos como parte integrante de sua política de investimento. Tais estratégias, da forma como são adotadas, podem resultar em perdas patrimoniais para seus cotistas, podendo inclusive acarretar perdas superiores ao capital aplicado e a consequente obrigação do cotista de aportar recursos adicionais.
			- Este fundo aplica em fundo de investimento que está autorizado a realizar aplicações em ativos financeiros no exterior.
			- Os fundos de ações podem estar expostos a significativa concentração em ativos de poucos emissores, com os riscos daí decorrentes. Este fundo está sujeito ao risco de concentração de mais de 30%(trinta por cento) de seu patrimônio líquido, ainda que de forma indireta, em ativos de "crédito privado".
			- Ao investidor é recomendada a leitura cuidadosa do prospecto e o regulamento do fundo de investimento ao aplicar seus recursos.
			- A utilização do Ibovespa como indicador é mera referência econômica, e não parâmetro objetivo do fundo. Em atendimento à Instrução CVM nº 465, desde 02/05/2008, os fundos de renda variável deixaram de apurar sua rentabilidade com base na cotação média das ações e passou a fazê-lo com base na cotação de fechamento. Assim comparações de rentabilidade devem utilizar, para períodos anteriores a 02/05/2008, a cotação média dos índices de ações e, para períodos posteriores a esta data, a cotação de fechamento
			- A utilização do "Benchmark" como indicador é mera referência econômica, e não parâmetro objetivo do fundo.
