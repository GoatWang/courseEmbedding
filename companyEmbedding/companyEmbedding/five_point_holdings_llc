We estimate that we will receive gross proceeds from this offering of $294.0
million, or $338.1 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us, we expect to receive net proceeds 
from this offering of approximately $269.4 million, or approximately $310.7 
million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full.

Net proceeds to the operating company from the concurrent private placement will
be $100 million.

We will contribute the net proceeds from this offering to the operating company
in exchange for Class A units of the operating company. We expect the operating
company to use all of the net proceeds received from us and from the concurrent
private placement to fund our development activities and for other general
corporate purposes.


We compete with other residential, retail and commercial property developers in
the development of properties in the Northern and Southern California markets.
Significant factors which we believe allow us to compete effectively in this
business include:

• the size and scope of our mixed-use, master-planned communities;

• the recreational and cultural amenities available within our communities;

• the commercial centers in our communities;

• our relationships with homebuilders; and

• the proximity to major metropolitan areas.


Company Description
We are the largest owner and developer of mixed-use, master-planned communities
in coastal California, based on the total number of residential homesites
permitted to be built under existing entitled zoning. Our three existing
communities have the general plan and zoning approvals necessary for


 the
construction of thousands of homesites and millions of square feet of commercial
space, and represent a significant portion of the real estate available for
development in three of the most dynamic and supply constrained markets along
the California coast—Los Angeles County, San Francisco County and Orange County.
These markets exhibit strong long-term housing demand fundamentals, including
population and employment growth, coupled with constrained supply of residential
land as a result of entitlement challenges and land availability. Our three
communities reflect 20 years of strategic positioning stemming from the assets
acquired during the tenure of Emile Haddad, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, when he served as Chief Investment Officer of Lennar, one of the
nation’s largest homebuilders.

We are developing new, vibrant and sustainable communities that, in addition to
homesites, include commercial, retail, educational and recreational elements, as
well as civic areas, parks and open spaces. We are the initial developer of our
three communities that are designed to include approximately 40,000 residential
homes and approximately 21 million square feet of commercial space over a period
of more than 10 years. Our three mixed-use, master-planned communities are:

• Newhall Ranch: Newhall Ranch consists of approximately 15,000 acres in one of
  the last growth corridors of northern Los Angeles County. Newhall Ranch is
  designed to include approximately 21,500 homesites and approximately 11.5
  million square feet of commercial space within this community. Newhall Ranch
  is directly adjacent to our completed, award-winning Valencia master-planned
  community, where today approximately 20,000 households reside and 
  approximately 60,000 people work.                   

• The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point: Located almost equidistant
  between downtown San Francisco and the San Francisco International Airport,
  The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point consists of approximately 800
  acres of bayfront property in the City of San Francisco. The San Francisco
  Shipyard and Candlestick Point is designed to include approximately 12,000
  homesites and approximately 4.1 million square feet of commercial space. The
  San Francisco Venture commenced land development in 2013, and the first homes
  were sold in April 2015. In November 2014, the San Francisco Venture entered 
  into a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of The Macerich Company
  (“Macerich”) to construct an approximately 550,000 square foot urban retail
  outlet shopping district at Candlestick Point. In November 2016, San Francisco
  voters approved an initiative measure, Proposition O, to exempt the San 
  Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point from restrictions on new office
  development applicable to all other projects citywide. In 2017, we intend to 
  seek approval from governmental authorities to increase total commercial space
  (including retail, hotels, artists’ studios, maker space, community uses and
  schools) in this community from approximately 4.1 million square feet to
  approximately 6.6 million square feet.         

• Great Park Neighborhoods: Great Park Neighborhoods consists of approximately 
  2,100 acres in Orange County, California, and is being built around the 
  approximately 1,300 acre Orange County Great Park, a metropolitan public park
  that is under construction and, upon completion, will be nearly twice the size
  of New York’s Central Park. Great Park Neighborhoods is designed to include
  approximately 9,500 homesites and approximately 4.9 million square feet of
  commercial space. The Great Park Venture sold the first homesites in April
  2013. As of December 31, 2016, the Great Park Venture had sold 3,866 homesites
  (including 544 affordable homesites) and commercial land allowing for
  development of up to 2 million square feet of commercial (research and
  development) space for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.68 billion.

The scale and positioning of our communities allow us to engage in long-term
development, providing numerous opportunities for us to add value for the
ultimate residential buyers and commercial owners. In addition, our development
activities benefit from our strong relationships and extensive experience
working with federal, state and local government agencies and other local
constituents to create economically vibrant communities. Our communities promote
quality living, with a focus on active lifestyles, diverse populations and an
optimal mix of housing and commercial development and employment opportunities.
