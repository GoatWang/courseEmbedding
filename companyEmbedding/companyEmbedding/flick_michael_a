Kevin Flick
Founder & CEO


Kevin is an industry veteran, with more than 15 years experience 
              in the field of software development. Formerly a lead developer 
              for Peter Norton [Norton Utilities; Norton AntiVirus], Kevin has been touted for his 
              ability to provide in depth development and management solutions 
              to such customers as IBM, Citicorp, and NatWest Bank (find out more 
              about Our Clients). Kevin has 
              contributed in fields as wide ranging as UNIX OS enhancements, Retail 
              Management Systems, and multi-threaded DOS. From a low-level understanding 
              of Operating Systems all the way through to the attractive Graphical 
              User Interface Design, Kevin has experience with the full cycle 
              of product development. Kevin is the author of Luckman's 
              WebCommander (TM) for Windows NT and 
              Windows95, published by Luckman Interactive. 

			  Kevin received his undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Southampton University, 
			  and his Masters from Queen Mary College, London University.

	Privacy Policy:



	Flicks.com Privacy Statement
We want you to get the most out of our Flicks Software  website and to trust that we make every effort to protect your confidentiality. Personal information is either requested or required on many areas of Flicks.com, to verify your identity and ensure that you qualify to use particular sections of the site. The amount and type of information received depends on how you use our site. The information may be stored and used in order to enhance our relationship with you.

Please take a few minutes to read our complete privacy statement so you can understand how information is used and the specific measures we take to protect your personal information. This page describes the policies of our company regarding any information we receive about you, while visiting Flicks.com. 

Normal Website Usage
Visit Flicks.com to access company, products, and services information, along with technical support and media updates, without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information. The only data we collect and store during normal website usage is typical web server log data. Examples of this type of data are: the name of your Internet service provider, the site that referred you to us, any pages you request, and the time and date of those requests etc.

We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to benefit Flicks.com users. This same information may be shared with third parties in order to provide these services or to analyze, store, or aggregate the information. It may also be shared with other third parties, working with us to improve the services of Flicks Software or this website.

Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
There are instances where Flicks Software requests personally identifiable information to provide site visitors with a service. This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, and type of request, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the request, as determined by Flicks Software, to fulfill your needs. To reiterate, all information you provide is used to improve the services offered by Flicks Software. This information may also be provided to our agencies for use on behalf of Flicks Software in accordance with our proscribed privacy statement. However, it is never provided or sold to any other company for that company's independent use.

During the course of your visit, you may move to other Flicks Software websites, including the sites designed specifically for technical support, or intended to provide information about third party compatible products. In addition, this site may provide links to third party sites not controlled by Flicks Software, such as those belonging to Flicks Software product dealers or third party product review sites. It is recommended that you check the specific privacy statements of any site before providing any personally identifiable information.

What are cookies?
A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored within your browser when you visit a cookie-enabled website. As you browse the Web, cookie-enabled sites will send cookies to your browser, along with pages. Your browser probably has options that will let you control whether the browser accepts cookies, rejects cookies, or notifies you each time a cookie is sent to you.

If your browser is set to reject cookies, cookie-enabled websites will not recognize you when you return. This provides you with anonymity, but it also makes it very difficult to offer you customized services. It is also less secure than using cookies, because all of your specific data must be sent to the website each time you view a page. Accepting cookies means your private data can stay at the Web server, and the only information transmitted over the Internet is your ID cookie.

If your browser is set to accept cookies, any cookies that are sent to your browser are stored in your computer for a period of time. There are a few different types of cookies. A "session" cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all of your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever. A "permanent" cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Permanent cookies stay on your computer until either
a) they expire,
b) they are overwritten with newer cookies,
c) you manually remove them.


Electronic Mail Containing Personal Information
Website users may decide to send Flicks Software personally identifying information via email. We will use this information for the purpose identified in the email message and to enhance our understanding of you in order to improve our services to you.



Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.

Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.

Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the 

Google ad and content network privacy policy.




Flicks Software is open Monday thru Friday, 8:30am - 5:00pm Pacific

About Flickr
Flickr - almost certainly the best online photo management and sharing application in the world - has two main goals:

1. We want to help people make their photos available to the people who matter to them.
Maybe they want to keep a blog of moments captured on their cameraphone, or maybe they want to show off their best pictures or video to the whole world in a bid for web celebrity. Or maybe they want to securely and privately share photos of their kids with their family across the country. Flickr makes all these things possible and more!
To do this, we want to get photos and video into and out of the system in as many ways as we can: from the web, from mobile devices, from the users' home computers and from whatever software they are using to manage their content. And we want to be able to push them out in as many ways as possible: on the Flickr website, in RSS feeds, by email, by posting to outside blogs or ways we haven't thought of yet. What else are we going to use those smart refrigerators for?
2. We want to enable new ways of organizing photos and video.
Once you make the switch to digital, it is all too easy to get overwhelmed with the sheer number of photos you take or videos you shoot with that itchy trigger finger. Albums, the principal way people go about organizing things today, are great -- until you get to 20 or 30 or 50 of them. They worked in the days of getting rolls of film developed, but the "album" metaphor is in desperate need of a Florida condo and full retirement.
Part of the solution is to make the process of organizing photos or videos collaborative. In Flickr, you can give your friends, family, and other contacts permission to organize your stuff - not just to add comments, but also notes and tags. People like to ooh and ahh, laugh and cry, make wisecracks when sharing photos and videos. Why not give them the ability to do this when they look at them over the internet? And as all this info accretes as metadata, you can find things so much easier later on, since all this info is also searchable.

Flickr continues to evolve in myriad ways, all of which are designed to make it easier and better. Check out the Flickr Blog to stay apprised of the latest developments. The fact that you've read to the end of this entire document and are hanging out at the bottom of this page with nothing but this silly text to keep you company is proof of a deep and abiding interest on your part. What are you waiting for?
