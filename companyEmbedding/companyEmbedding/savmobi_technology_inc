We expect to use the proceeds that we receive from the sale of securities
offered hereby to cover the costs associated with this offering estimated at
$10,000 and for the initial funding of our business development and for general
working capital purposes. As of the date of this prospectus, we have generated
no revenues from our business operations.

Our officer and director has committed to lend funds (up to $30,000) to the
Company for the next twelve months to cover expenses to maintain the reporting
status current with the SEC, if necessary. Mr. Sidhu is willing to lend the full
amount of these funds to the Company as expenses are incurred, if no other
proceeds are available to the Company, and if the amount raised through this
offering is not enough to cover such expenses. However, there is no contract in
place or written agreement that legally binds or guarantees that Mr. Sidhu will
provide funds to the Company and the funds expressed in the above verbal
commitment, would be in the form of a non-secured loan and would have no
interest and no fixed repayment dates. 
---

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.05. The offering is being conducted on a "best efforts' basis and
the offering scenarios that follow are for illustrative purposes only. The
actual amount of proceeds, if any, may differ. The following table sets forth
the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively,
of the securities offered for sale by the Company.

                                If 25% of        If 50% of        If 75% of        If 100% of

Although SavMobi can be considered to operate in many industries, our proposed
revenue streams we expect to come from the hyper-local marketing space. Our
proposed primary source of revenue we expect will come from local, small
businesses. We're fighting for their marketing dollars in a competitive market
dominated by traditional advertisements such as print & radio, and upcoming
digital advertisement from Google Ads, Microsoft/Bing Advertising, Foursquare,
and Waze. Other major players in the hyper-local space are Groupon,
LivingSocial, Yelp, and Pirq.

By having Members set their preferences, they can receive promos without the
need of searching. In essence, SavMobi pre-empts searching making our marketing
efforts a step ahead of search advertisement. Since Vendors have set the
distance to send their promos and Members opt-in to preferences, the promos that
Members receive have high relevancy.

SavMobi is not reliant on check-ins or maps, even though we have similar
features. The check-in model gives consumers discounts and offers after they
intended to visit that business. Users of Foursquare, a social, check-in
network, primarily use the service to notify their friends of their current
location. Foursquare is experimenting with ways to monetize their business model
and enhance the business experience through promotions. Their current efforts
involve methods of exploration and discovery.

Waze created a traffic and navigation app that allows businesses to advertise by
pinning their location on maps. Waze is promoting to businesses that they will
reach a community of millions of drivers and everyday commuters. However, Waze
users are primarily looking for the best route to their intended location not
for pins on a map.

Daily deal sites such as Groupon and LivingSocial transformed the hyperlocal
market. They brought local vendors new customers through a digital option that
had no upfront costs, and they changed consumer perception of redeeming coupons.
Although a revolutionary concept, the sustainability of daily deals has not been
proven. Businesses that participate in daily deals have mixed experiences
including loss of profit, overwhelming peak traffic, and inconsistent results.

Yelp and Pirq are expected to be our biggest competitors once our proposed
product(s) are launched. Yelp is a local directory service with social
networking and user reviews. In the first quarter of 2015, they had more than
142 million unique visitors to their website, yelp.com. Their primary source of
revenue comes from local business advertising. Businesses may advertise with
Yelp for preferred search result placement and extra listing features. The
advertising fee may include an individualized message, video, and photo slide
show onto their listing as well as analytic reports. Businesses that advertise
with Yelp pay to be at preferred locations on a search page hoping that
consumers will see their listing and come to their location. Although that is a
strong message, SavMobi goes a step further by putting a more enticing message
in front of our Members, a discount or offer.

Pirq's business model is similar to our business model. They've built an app
that displays businesses in the area and the discount that is offered. Users
look for the business and discount they'd like, enter the business location, and
scan a Microsoft tag (similar to a QR code) to receive their discount. Pirq
initially launched as a restaurant deals app. They are currently trying to
expand to other industries and services. After being in operations for 4.5
years, they are still positioned as a restaurant deals app in the eyes of
businesses and consumers. They operate nationwide.

There are many competitors that exist. This is a clear indication on the growth
and potential of the hyper-local market. Although our competitors share traits
and similarities to us, SavMobi intends to build from the ground up to become a
preferred vendor platform provided that attracts consumers to local businesses.
What distinguishes our proposed Company's software are features that are unique
and are not included in our competitors software and apps; these included;
Firstly, our proposed Members are able to set their preferences and then receive
promos via their smartphones without the need of a general search on the web. In
essence, SavMobi pre-empts searching, making our marketing efforts a step ahead
of our competitors broad general search advertisements. Secondly, we also allow
our proposed Vendors to provide set distances to send their promos and with the
Members opt-in preferences, the promos the Members receive (as per their
preferences) have a high relevancy. This allows Vendors to target consumers
within a specific neighborhood if they so choose.


Company Description
SavMobi Technology Inc. was formed in the state of Nevada as a for-profit
Company on March 6, 2015. We intend to provide application software to a global
vendor platform to connect people to businesses and provide a new shopping
experience. This begins with our proposed Mobile Marketing Platform


 that enables
vendors to send targeted promotion and, offers to Members based on their
location and needs. Members only receive promotions that they want, when they
want it. The platform eliminates the need for searching by delivering
information based on demand.

SavMobi intends to be a technology provider of vendor tools. The proposed first
platform connects businesses to consumers based on location and preferences for
products and services. Consumers receive promos while they are travelling via
their smartphone. Vendors can send promotions and special offers simply through
the web. When the consumer goes to the vendor's location, they can redeem the
promo through their smartphone allowing the platform to keep track of
performance analytics. SavMobi proposed Mobile Marketing Platform helps
businesses by bringing customers into their door and increasing sales.

 NOTE
1 –
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 

SAVMOBI
TECHNOLOGY INC. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a
for-profit Company on March 6, 2015 and established a fiscal year
end of May 31. The Company is organized to develop a Mobile
Marketing Platform that helps businesses by bringing customers into
their door and increasing sales.

 

SAVMOBI
planned platform connects businesses to consumers based on location
and preferences for products and services. Consumers receive
promotions while they are travelling via their smartphone. Vendors
can send promotions and special offers simply through the web. When
the consumer goes to the vendor’s location, they can redeem
the promotion through their smartphone allowing the platform to
keep track of performance analytics.

 

Going
concern

 

To date
the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations
and has incurred operating losses since inception of $34,635. As at
November 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of
$12,645. The Company requires additional funding to meet its
ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately
to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise
substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its
business by way of private placements and advances from related
parties as may be required. As of November 30, 2016, the Company
has issued 375,000,000 founders shares at $0.00001 per share for
net proceeds of $7,500 to the Company and private placements of
15,000,000 common shares at $0.001 per share for net proceeds of
$15,000. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might
result from this uncertainty.

 

NOTE 2
– SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

 

Basis of
Presentation – Unaudited Financial
Statements

 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They
do not include all information and footnotes required by United
States generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there
has been no material changes in the information disclosed in the
notes to the financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31,
2016 included in the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited financial
statements should be read in conjunction with those financial
statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of Management,
all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation,
consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made.
Operating results for the six months ended November 30, 2016 are
not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
the year ending May 31, 2017.

 

Segmented
Reporting

 

FSAB ASC
280, “Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information”, changed the way public companies report
information about segments of their business in their quarterly
reports issued to shareholders. It also requires entity-wide
disclosures about the products and services the entity provides,
the material countries in which it holds assets and reports
revenues and its major customers.

 

Comprehensive
Loss

 

“Reporting
Comprehensive Income,” establishes standards for the
reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in
the financial statements. As at November 30, 2016, the Company has
no items that represent a comprehensive loss and, therefore, has
not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial
statements.

 

Use of
Estimates and Assumptions

 

Preparation
of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE 2
– SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(continued)

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers
highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

 

Foreign
Currency Translation

 

The
Company translates the foreign currency financial statements into
US Dollars using the year or reporting period end of average
exchange rates in accordance with the requirements of Accounting
Standards Codification subtopic 830-10, Foreign Currency Matters
(“ASC 830-10”). Assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries were translated at exchange rates as of the balance
sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
in effect for the periods presented. The cumulative translation
adjustment is included in the accumulated other comprehensive gain
(loss) within shareholders’ equity (deficit). Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate
fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than
the functional currency are included in the results of
operations.

 

Financial
Instruments

 

All
significant financial assets, financial liabilities and equity
instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in
the financial statements together with other information relevant
for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest
rate risk and credit risk. Where practical the fair values of
financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and
disclosed; otherwise only available information pertinent to fair
value has been disclosed.

 

Loss per
Common Share

 

The basic
earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the
Company’s net income available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares during the year. The
diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the
Company’s net income (loss) available to common shareholders
by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding
is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially
dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the
same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive
items in the Company.

 

Income
Taxes

 

The
Company follows the liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances
and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates
expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the date of
enactment or substantive enactment.

 

Stock-based
Compensation

 

The
Company follows ASC 718-10, "Stock Compensation", which addresses
the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its
equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on
transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 is a revision to SFAS
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and supersedes
Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," and its related implementation
guidance. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee
