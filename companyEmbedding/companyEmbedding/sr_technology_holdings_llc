FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Renowned Violinist Ryu Goto Debuts At Carnegie Hall May 4, 2010, Launches Excellence In Music Initiative For NYC Students
Acclaimed 21-year old Japanese-American violinist and native New Yorker Ryu Goto, 
		currently majoring in physics at Harvard University (Class of 2010), 
		created the Excellence In Music initiative to give back to New York by 
		transforming the lives of NYC students through the power of music.
		
Goto Explains, “Through Excellence In Music, in cooperation of the New York 
		City Council, S&R Technology Holdings, LLC and the NYC Department Of Education, 
		I can give back to the city that has given me so much as an artist and a person. 
		I’m excited to provide opportunities for NYC students to develop their talent 
		and appreciation of classical music.”
		
The New York City Council was instrumental in making Excellence In Music possible.
NYC Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn states, “The New York City Council has 
		long been committed to providing public school students with an arts education. 
		We’re pleased Ryu Goto is working with the Department Of Education to provide 
		opportunities and assistance to deserving student musicians as well as the chance for 
		students across the city to experience and appreciate classical music. It’s our hope 
		that Ryu’s “Excellence In Music” initiative will both support and encourage NYC students 
		to recognize their talent and realize their goals.” 
		
NYC Council Education Committee Chair Robert Jackson added, “I am delighted an artist of 
		Ryu Goto’s caliber is bringing deserving NY students new ways to learn about and enjoy 
		classical music, and to realize their aspirations as student musicians, and thank S&R 
		Technology Holdings for making the Award possible.” He adds, “Such an opportunity (the 
		concert, and open rehearsal) is possible ONLY in New York because of the concentration 
		of cultural institutions that we have here and I hope Ryu’s example will inspire other 
		artists to share their time and talent with public school students throughout the city.”
		
Excellence In Music begins with two far-reaching efforts: the presentation of the Ryu 
		Goto Excellence In Music Award, Sponsored by S&R Technology Holdings, LLC, on May 4, 
		2010, and an Open Rehearsal performance of his Carnegie Hall debut with Orpheus Chamber 
		Orchestra, taking place on April 30, 2010 at Stuyvesant High School. Future efforts 
		include collaboration with the All-City Orchestra, master classes and one-on-one 
		workshops.
		
States Paul King, Executive Director of the Department of Education’s Office of the 
		Arts and Special Projects, The Department of Education thanks S&R Technology Holdings, 
		LLC for their generous grant, and we are delighted to partner with a musician of Ryu’s 
		caliber. The Excellence in Music Award is a significant step toward fostering the 
		development of musical talent and the study of classical music in New York City schools.”
		
The Ryu Goto Excellence In Music Award, an annual $1000 scholarship awarded to an 
		exceptional student musician in the All-City Orchestra, will be presented at NYU’s 
		Skirball Center, on May 4, 2010. The Award provides practical support to talented 
		student musicians.
		
S&R Founders and Managing Members Dr. Kuno and Dr. Ueno state, “S&R Technology Holdings 
		is pleased to have the opportunity to work with Ryu Goto, the NYC Council and the NYC 
		Department Of Education to create the Excellent In Music Award, and we look forward to 
		a long and fruitful relationship that allows us to provide assistance to talented NYC 
		student musicians.”
		
The April 30th Open Rehearsal of Ryu Goto’s Carnegie Hall concert at Stuyvesant High 
		School, in collaboration with Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, giving students an opportunity 
		to see the creative process in action and enjoy some of the world’s finest musical 
		talent.
		
Orpheus Executive Director Graham Parker affirms “The opportunity for the Orpheus 
		Chamber Orchestra to collaborate with Ryu Goto, the NYC Council and the Department of 
		Education on this Open Rehearsal not only gives our musicians an opportunity to provide 
		NYC students a view of the creative process, but helps to foster a love and 
		understanding of classical music in general, and we are delighted to take part.”

If this is your company...



We may be able to find you a more suitable carrier for your business insurance.  We have extensive data on carriers, their coverage, and company rates.  Rather than having an agent sell you, why not find which carrier is best for your business and approach them?  Contact Us to see if there is a better fit for your business.  We are not insurance agents, and are not trying to sell you anything.  We will simply tell you some carriers that may be better suited, and suggest agents in your area.

What is an Experience Mod Rating?



The Mod Rating is one of the two most important factors that effect a carrier's premium for workers comp insurance.  Each business in a state is provided a mod rating by the state's rating bureau which is a reflection of the amount of workers comp claims they have had.  If someone has an accident at work, your mod rating will increase and so will your premium.

What is an LCM?



A Loss Cost Multiplier, or LCM, is a rating for an insurance carrier that reflects their overhead in providing coverage for workers comp insurance.  It is one of the two main ratings that effect an insurance premium.  You are more likely to get a better premium from a carrier with a lower LCM, so it is important to know what your carrier's LCM is.  While a premium is generally the result of a formula, carriers are able to deviate plus or minus 25% from that formula.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
