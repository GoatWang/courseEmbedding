The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Pacific Energy Solutions Breaks Ground on $334.1 Million Solar Energy Contract for the Department of Defense and the U.S. Navy in Hawaii

Aug 04, 2014, 17:49 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Pacific Energy Solutions 











 
















































 

 




















 


HONOLULU, Aug. 4, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Pacific Energy Solutions (PES), an energy project development company specializing in renewable technologies, announced that on 11 July, 2014, they entered into a binding contract with the U.S. Navy to supply approximately 30,400 MWh of electricity annually to the Navy for use by Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force activities in the State of Hawaii. PES will supply this electricity to the Navy over a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement term. 
A groundbreaking ceremony was conducted on 24 July 2014 at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. The ceremony was presided over by the Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable Ray Mabus, who was joined by the Governor of the State of Hawaii, Neil Abercrombie. 
In support of its deliveries under this contract, PES will install 68,645 photovoltaic modules at 14 project sites at military installations on the Island of Oahu. Additionally, PES will construct a 2 mile underground transmission system, including a bored crossing, beneath the Pearl Harbor Channel. These solar installations, once completed, are estimated to offset 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year and eliminate the necessity to burn the equivalent of 54,000 barrels of oil annually. The solar installations will include a utility scale facility on the Waipio Peninsula, which is expected to be, when completed, the largest solar generation facility in the State of Hawaii.
Of the successful completion of this stage of the project's development, PES' CEO Don O'Shei said, "The Department of Defense and the U.S. Navy have set aggressive and important goals for the use of clean and renewable sources of energy in support of their defense of the Nation. These solar installations that we are implementing today will contribute greatly to meeting those goals and we are proud to play a small part."
About Pacific Energy Solutions: PES is a renewable energy development company based in Boca Raton, FL. Founded in 2010, PES is owned by TriLateral Energy, LLC and ECC Energy Solutions. LLC. The principals and employees of PES, TriLateral Energy and ECC Energy Solutions have decades of experience in the development, project finance, construction and the operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects.
