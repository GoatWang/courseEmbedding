Schauerman resigned from the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). Mr. Schauerman resigned to pursue other business opportunities.
Bill Koertner, MYR Group’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “On behalf of MYR Group’s Board of Directors and management team, we would like to thank Mr. Schauerman for his service to our Company and we wish him well with his future endeavors.” Mr. Schauerman was appointed to the Board in March 2016. Prior to his resignation, Mr. Schauerman also served on the Company’s Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

Forward-Looking Statements Various statements in this announcement, including those that express a belief, expectation, or intention, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, revenue, income, capital spending, segment improvements and investments. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “likely,” “unlikely,” “possible,” “potential,” “should” or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. The forward-looking statements in this announcement speak only as of the date of this announcement; we disclaim any obligation to update these statements (unless required by securities laws), and we caution you not to rely on them unduly. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those projected. Forward-looking statements in this press announcement should be evaluated together with the many uncertainties that affect MYR Group's business, particularly those mentioned in the risk factors and cautionary statements in Item 1A of MYR Group's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and in any risk factors or cautionary statements contained in MYR Group's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

Both appointments were effective February 6, 2009. Mr. Schauerman, 52, joined Primoris in 1993 as Senior Vice President and a director, and was named Chief Financial Officer in February 2008. He has been responsible for Primoris's financial activities, corporate planning, financial relationships, capital commitments, acquisitions and sales of business segments, and project development. In 
his new role, Mr. Schauerman will focus on developing and integrating Primoris's

Pete brings a unique combination of financial and operational expertise to his new role. We expect to draw on his experience, relationships and judgment in integrating growth opportunities both financially and operationally. John created a 
strong financial infrastructure, which, in combination with Pete's experience and familiarity with our operations, should ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities." Primoris also announced that Peter C. Brown, CPA, has joined the Company's Board of Directors, increasing the size of the board to 8 members.
