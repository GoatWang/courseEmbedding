Miller Products





And the more you learn about our manufacturing process, the more you'll see that no other heating and cooling manufacturer compares to Miller's product quality. While other companies test products at random, we use 100% computer-automated testing on every Miller product to eliminate human error in the final analysis of product quality. We are the only heating and cooling manufacturer to be certified in Demand Flow Technology™. With more than 90 years of experience in the manufactured housing industry, it is easy to see why most new manufactured homes are built with Miller heating systems, and when applicable, are equipped with Miller cooling systems, too.

The outstanding performance of our starting inserts is the foundation of our success. Our inserts will not mar or damage your nose cones and will last 100 times longer than any other insert worldwide. 

Our Persuader Belt Reduction units are designed to start those big cubic inch engines. Big Grip starting cup and insert is engineered for larger nose cones (for the hobbyist to build their own starter or adapt to your purchased starter). Our ½ A Starter is used to start those small engines like .049, .051, and .09. Helicopter extension inserts and mounting back rubber inserts are available to fit different starters and different helicopter extensions. Miller R/C Products also has many miscellaneous inserts and products that have been developed through the years. 
If what you need is not available from Miller R/C Products, chances are we can custom-make it for you. See your favorite hobby dealer or contact Hap and Nancy Miller direct.            
We invite you to see for yourself what sets us apart.

 This Student Edition of The Crucible is perfect for students of literature and drama and offers an unrivalled guide to Miller's classic play. It features an extensive introduction by Susan C. W. Abbotson which includes: a chronology of Miller's life and times; a summary of the plot and commentary on the characters, themes, language, context and production history of the play. Together with over twenty questions for further study, detailed notes on words and phrases from the text and the additional scene 2 of the second Act, this is the definitive edition of the play. In a small tight-knit community gossip and rumour spread like wildfire inflaming personal grievances until no-one is safe from accusation and vengeance. The Crucible is Miller's classic dramatisation of the witch-hunt and trials that besieged the Puritan community of Salem in 1692. Seen as a chilling parallel to the McCarthyism and repressive culture of fear that gripped America in the 1950s, the play's timeless relevance and appeal remains as strong as when the play opened on Broadway in 1953.

Review
'The uniform structure and consistent approach eveident in these [first] four volumes make them readable and accessible to students and scholars alike and guarantee that these editions will certainly persist as invaluable tools for those who both enjoy Miller as a dramatist and study him as a significant social and American spokesperson.' The Arthur Miller Journal, fall 2010

The play explores paranoia, the power of superstition and mass hysteria. It shows the dangers of using a scapegoat to fix problems in society. Classed as one of the great American plays along with the likes of Long Day’s Journey Into Night, Miller wrote the play as an allegory for McCarthyism, when the US government ostracized people for being communists. Many prominent people became victims of the Red Scare, Arthur Miller was one of many people who came to the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee. In his play The Crucible Miller drew comparisons with the Red Scare and the witch trials of 1692 in Salem, Massachusetts.Read more0Comment|

Based on what was happening during 1950's America with McCarthyism, the link between that and the Salem Witch Trials, which are true historical events, is brilliantly worked. I had this as part of my A-Level course for English, and up until then, I had ever heard of it. I had never even heard of Arthur Miller. I would strongly recommend this play for educational purposes and also if you just fancy having a good read.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsMillers cry against McCarthyismByally4580on 2 December 2010Format: PaperbackThis book has no great action scenes yet is probably one of the most powerful plays ever written. The characters face tragedy and are forced to either conform, or stand up for what they believe is right, in a time when people feared what was different and used religion and politics as a tool to manipulate others. Miller manages to show that people, after nearly 500 years are still battling the same evils, whether its witches in the 1600's, Nazi Germany, the McCarthy trials (which Miller himself was subjected to) or Afghanistan today.This book particularly was great with it's plot summary and wider reading list it's helpful for anyone writing essays on The Crucible. I really recommend this for anyone who has a passion for reading.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsArthur Miller's 'the crucible'ByThe Readeron 2 January 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI think in general this a book of another tale of woe so just for those who like historical and non-fictional works with the hint of English prejudice worked into the mix. I mainly dislike that how in an item originally intended to provide intellectual ideology for two time frames it ends up incorporating the usual kind of drama commonly found in modern day soaps. I might recommend it therefore to people with a larger intellectual interests in the latter who can't stomach literature without a twist plot not found in places outside of the playwrights mind. Except the latter concern however a good read.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsfascinating and horrifyingByA customeron 18 October 2000Format: PaperbackMiller's title is appropriate for the play. He creates an atmosphere and mood in the play that is significant to the time that the Salem witch hunt took place and of the Puritan culture. Miller successfully captures the religious fanaticism of the period and adds it effectively to the play. I would recommend this play to everyone. It is very different to miller's other plays. It is superb from beginning to end.Read more0Comment|

Whereas then communists were rooted out, in Salem, it's witches. Hysteria grips the town, and Miller portrays this perfectly, and explores a frightening realism of the human mind. Feuds from long ago come back into light, and no-one is safe, not even from their children. This is an incredible play, and is firmly regarded as one of the best plays ever written.Read more0Comment|

Drizly launches alcohol-delivery service in Columbus

				JD Malone, The Columbus Dispatch
			
Country singers, fraternity brothers and anxious hostesses won't have to go on a beer run this New Year's Eve if alcohol supplies run low. This year, in several Columbus neighborhoods at least, restocking adult beverages no longer will require keys or a car - just a smartphone and a credit card. Locally-owned Refill can drop booze and beer at your doorstep. And this month, Boston-based Drizly, an online and mobile alcohol ordering service, launched here and in two other Ohio markets - Akron and suburban Cleveland, as well as Middletown. "The service is e-commerce for alcohol," said Nick Rellas, CEO of Drizly. "It is a pretty simple idea: letting you shop for alcohol on your phone." Mobile and online ordering has become the norm for a host of everyday items, from shoes to shaving cream. Consumers can order groceries at Giant Eagle and Kroger via their phone and arrange for pick up. And there are numerous restaurant ordering/delivery platforms like Grubhub, Cafe Courier and Amazon Restaurants. Even Wendy's opened an office across from Ohio State University that focuses on improving its mobile ordering and other technologies. So it was perhaps inevitable that alcohol sales have made the move to mobile ordering and delivery. "There is clearly a tremendous amount of digital ordering," said David Portalatin, vice president and food industry analyst at the NPD Group. "The consumer is rapidly adopting it ... to get what they want where they want it." Yet alcohol has befuddled such enterprises before. Drinkos, which offered alcohol ordering and delivery, opened here in 2015 and didn't last a year. Refill also opened in 2015 and plans to expand into Cleveland and Cincinnati next year. Drizly has a longer track record. At five years old, it's well-established for a mobile-ordering software company, and operates in more than 40 cities. Further, the company has experience navigating alcohol laws that vary state to state and that often date from the end of Prohibition. The other thing going for it is that retailers seem to like the concept and will keep trying some version of mobile ordering because an increasing number of customers want it. "People ask all the time; it is a very common question," said Gursev Sidhu, owner of Arena Wine and Spirits, Drizly's initial partner in Columbus. "We had been looking to do delivery for two or three years, but we had no system to do it with. We couldn't do it on the fly." Sidhu has two regular delivery drivers and a pair of substitutes who can fill in. His drivers are trained to combat underage drinking, something Drizly takes very seriously. Drizly requires that an identification card be presented and scanned at the time of delivery. "It is very thorough," he said. "When we do ID checking, you have to check anyone you can see from the door. If it's fishy, we don't (complete the delivery)." Sidhu also takes orders from Refill. Drizly plans to expand to more retailers as it expands its service in Columbus. Drizly is offering delivery to Downtown, German Village, Clintonville, Upper Arlington, the University District and Grandview Heights, areas Sidhu can't usually reach from his Arena District store. Refill can reach most of the neighborhoods inside Interstate 270 as well as Pickerington. "(The services) reach areas where we do not," Sidhu said. That's one reason services like Refill and Drizly, and Amazon Restaurants, are likely to see a lot of growth in the years to come. A good mobile ordering platform gives stores a way to reach additional customers in a format those customers prefer, Portalatin said. Refill can be accessed through its website, www.alcoholtogo.com, and via its app. Its service includes delivery of beer, wine and spirits. Drizly can be accessed through its website, www.drizly.com, and by downloading its app. Its offerings include beer and wine - no liquor just yet - and it is offering free delivery for first-time orders to promote its launch, but delivery runs around $5 in most markets. Refill charges $6.99 for delivery. There is also a minimum order set by retailers. For Arena Wine and Spirits the minimum order is $19.  jmalone@dispatch.com

All About Liquor

Unless you're lining up a bunch of shots, liquor takes a little more work than cracking a beer or pouring a glass of wine. However, the effort is well worth the result if you've picked up the right bottle. Enjoy the sophisticated complexity of whiskey all on its own or create an amazing gin cocktail. Impress your guests with a digestif or get the party started with a batch of margaritas. You can find a different liquor brand or cocktail to suit every occasion. Plus, being able to whip up a delicious cocktail will never not impress your guests.
Whiskey:
With a diverse array of flavors, you can try a different whiskey or bourbon every night and never get bored. It tastes great straight from the glass, though you can dress it up with flavored soda, sparkling water or other mixers. Try light and dark whiskeys to experience the full spectrum of notes, from fruity and light to bitter, spicy and dark.
Vodka:
Although higher-end vodka can taste wonderful straight from the shot glass or tumbler, it's perfect for cocktails. When you crave spicy, whip up a batch of bloody marys — and don't skimp on the hot sauce. A vodka martini tastes great with a few olives, while a Cosmopolitan will satisfy anyone with a sweet tooth and a penchant for "Sex and the City" marathons.
Tequila:
It's best known for its inclusion in popular cocktails, from margaritas and tequila sunrises to Joan Collinses and tequila sours. It's also perfect as an apéritif when mixed with simple tonic. Choose a lighter-colored tequila for this cocktail, and don't forget to add plenty of crushed ice.
Brandy:
If you want to impress someone, keep a bottle of good brandy on hand. It's best served neat in a well-rounded snifter, though a simple tumbler works too. To experience the full array of rich flavors, hold the glass between your hands to warm the liquid inside. Like wine, brandy often tastes best after you take a good whif, so don't forget to sniff before you lift the glass to your lips.
Gin:
This humble liquor has been popular for centuries thanks to its fairly simple taste. If you're planning a party, collect the recipe ingredients necessary for gin martinis, gimlets, Tom Collinses, and Singapore slings. Of course, it also tastes great with a splash of soda on the rocks.
Start searching around to buy liquor online, whether it's a fancy bottle to impress your in-laws or some mini liquor bottles to take on your next flight.

All About Wine

Whether you're dedicated to your signature wines or you're looking for a new bottle that'll blow your mind, you'll find all the wine you've ever dreamed of right here. Find out why we consider ourselves a wine lover's paradise and discover why Drizly is the best place to shop for everything from your everyday table wine to your special occasion bottles.
Red Wines:
If you can't tell a Syrah from a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Rioja from a Bordeaux, there still might be hope for you yet. Discover the cherry and cassis notes in a great bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon or start sipping an easy-to-drink Merlot. But don't just stay in the Old World — go beyond just France and try some of our bestselling bottles of Australian Shiraz, Argentinian Malbec and Spanish Rioja.
White Wines:
If you've never met a glass of white wine you didn't love, start sipping your way through our vast selection to find your new fave. From full-bodied Chardonnay to crisp Riesling to refreshing Pinot Grigio, we have the perfect bottle so you can make your own happy hour. Try bottles of Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand or South Africa, Chardonnay from California or Australia or Gewürztraminer from Germany or France. You'll totally feel like a world traveler just from your couch!
Sparkling Wines:
Whether you're celebrating an anniversary, a major milestone at work or just the end of a great day, you need the perfect sparkling wine. For the uninitiated, bubbly goes way beyond Champagne. Sure, this French varietal is the most famous type of sparkling wine. But if you'd rather try a pleasant Prosecco or a Catalonian Cava, we have just the bottle of bubbly for you. A popped cork makes your day more poppin'. True story.
Rosé Wines:
On a warm summer day, nothing hits the spot like a glass of rosé. Don't be scared off by the color — real heroes love pink. Try a dry, full-bodied bottle from Côtes de Provence and feel like you're that much closer to your dream of horseback riding through the French countryside. Or save a bottle of sparkling rosé for when you really need your special occasion to stand out from all those other basic bubblies.
Dessert Wines:
The next time you want to finish your meal with a little something sweet, skip that crème brûlée and go for a glass of dessert wine instead. Know you're the classiest person around with a glass of Port and Sherry, or sweeten the deal with our extensive selection of Amontillado or yes, even Vermouth.

All About Beer

It's good to have beers around. In the fridge. At the office. In the cooler. Not so much in the car. But almost everywhere else. It's like a comfort blanket for adults. And there are so many different beer types, you'll never get bored. Fancy beers, cheap beers, flavorful beers, light beers—they've all got their time and place. That place mostly being in our hearts.
Top Trending Styles of Beer:
IPA:
If you dig hops, India Pale Ale is your beer. Legend says British brewers packed extra hops into beer before the long voyage to India. Is it true? Who cares? Drink it. IPAs vary from a gentle hop handshake to a sock in the eye. Dry-hopped versions are made from preserved hops and are sharper. Fresh/wet hopped brews are made right after harvest, featuring a more floral nose and hints of apricot.
Lager:
The classic golden brew from bottom-fermenting yeast is typically clean and light in flavor. Clarity is its trademark, but some include dark caramelized malt that produces a black lager mellower than porter or stout. Rare India Pale Lagers feature big hop aromas but finish softer than their ale cousins. However, most lagers are easy-drinking fishing brews that defy beer snobbery, pair nicely with each other and are served best in a cooler full of ice.
Cider:
While cider is jumping out of nowhere in the U.S., it's always been big in the UK, which is the world's biggest cider consumer. They can be made from any kind of apple, and even pears, but high-sugar cider apples are best. They range from crystal clear to murky and brown. Most sparkle, but some are still. Cider is a good choice for those concerned about wheat. Be sure to choose a pure one not blended with ale.
Ale:
"Pale" refers to the color of malt, as opposed to "amber" or "dark." Malt dried slowly without caramelization is pale. The drying process was tough to control centuries ago, so heavily roasted malts were the rule. Now pale malts are easier to make. They produce beers that balance full body and crisp refreshment. Pale ales sparked the American microbrewery revolution of the past couple of decades. Although not born here, pale ales are now as American as hot dogs.
Stout:
The baby born of deeply caramelized malt, stout is dark as a black hole with a full mouthfeel and a head you can chew. They range from creamy/chocolatey/malty to cocoa/espresso/tobacco. While some are as strong as they look with ABV of over 8 percent, others are deceptively light. The most famous stout, Guinness, has less alcohol and fewer calories than most golden brews, making it the perfect lunch beverage. Nitrogenization gives it a velvety texture.
Beer Myths 101:

Cold to warm and back again will skunk beer: Nope. Temperature won't corrupt your beer, but light will. If you're running out of room in the fridge, feel free to remove some beers without worrying. Just don't store them in your trunk during the summer.
Bottles > Cans: Again, nope. We just talked about this. Light is bad for your beer and cans are better at keeping it out. They're also better at keeping oxygen out, which is also no friend of beer.
Stouts are heavy and boozy: Appearances can be deceiving. Stouts might look like a lot to handle, but they're surprisingly light. Guinness actually has less calories and alcohol than Budweiser.
