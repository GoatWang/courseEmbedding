REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




To the Unitholders of Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 285:



We have audited the accompanying statement of condition (including the
analysis of net assets and the related portfolio schedule) of Build America
Bonds Income Trust, Series 54 (the "Trust," included in Van Kampen Unit Trusts,
Taxable Income Series 285) as of September 30, 2014, and the related statements
of operations and changes in net assets for each of the three years in the
period ended September 30, 2014, and the financial highlights for the period
from October 19, 2010 (date of deposit) through September 30, 2011 and for each
of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2014. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned at September 30, 2014 by correspondence with The Bank of New
York Mellon, Trustee. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Build America Bonds Income Trust, Series 54 (included in Van Kampen Unit
Trusts, Taxable Income Series 285) as of September 30, 2014, and the results of
its operations and changes in net assets for each of the three years in the
period ended September 30, 2014, and the financial highlights for the period
from October 19, 2010 (date of deposit) through September 30, 2011 and for each
of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2014, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.






VAN KAMPEN UNIT TRUSTS, TAXABLE INCOME SERIES 285





Notes to Financial Statements

September 30, 2012, 2013 and 2014





NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Security Valuation - The securities are stated at the value determined by
the Evaluator, a third party valuation provider. The Evaluator may determine
the value of the securities (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the
securities obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in securities
comparable to those held by the Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices for
comparable securities, (3) by determining the value of the securities by
appraisal or (4) by any combination of the above.


Security Cost - The original cost to the Trust (Build America Bonds Income
Trust, Series 54) was based on the determination by the Evaluator of the
offering prices of the securities on the date of deposit (October 19, 2010).
Since the valuation is based upon the bid prices, the Trust (Build America
Bonds Income Trust, Series 54) recognized a downward adjustment of $337,833 on
the date of deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering
prices. This downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of
unrealized depreciation reported in the financial statements for the Trust for
the period ended September 30, 2011.


Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit in the Trust based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the
process of being collected, (2) the securities in the Trust based on the value
determined by the Evaluator and (3) interest accrued thereon, less accrued
expenses of the Trust, if any.


Federal Income Taxes - For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to August 2,
2006, such Trust has been structured to be treated as a grantor trust for
federal income tax purposes. Thus, such a Trust will not be treated as a
taxable entity for federal income tax purposes, and each Unitholder will be
considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of such Trust.
Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes. For a Trust
with a Date of Deposit on or after August 2, 2006, each such Trust has elected
and intends to qualify on a continuous basis for special income tax treatment
as a "regulated investment company" ("RIC") under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. If such Trust so qualifies, as expected, it will not be
subject to federal income tax on amounts distributed to Unitholders. Your
Trust's Date of Deposit is listed above in the section entitled "Summary of
Essential Financial Information". For a discussion of the federal tax status of
income earned on Units, see "Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts" or "Federal
Tax Status--Regulated Investment Companies", as applicable, in Part II of this
Prospectus.


For each calendar year-end, a RIC trust files an annual tax return, Form
1120-RIC, with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). These returns are subject
to IRS examination under a three-year statute of limitations. To date, the
Trust has no IRS examination pending.


Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ("ASC"), clarifies the appropriate method of accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements
and provides related guidance. There is no material effect on the net asset
value, financial condition or results of operations of the Trust.


Subsequent Events - Events or transactions that have occurred from the
balance sheet date through the date of issuance are evaluated by the Sponsor.


Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are
reported on an identified cost basis.



NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO



Ratings - The source of all ratings, exclusive of those designated NR or *
is Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P"). Ratings
marked * are by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") as these Bonds are
not rated by S&P. NR indicates that the Bond is not rated by S&P or Moody's.
The ratings shown represent the latest published ratings of the Bonds. For a
brief description of rating symbols and their related meanings, see
"Description of Securities Ratings" in the Information Supplement.


Redemption Feature - There is shown under this heading the year in which
each issue of Bonds is initially or currently callable and the call price for
that year. Each issue of Bonds continues to be callable at declining prices
thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue discount Bonds
which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of
original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some
premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. "S.F." indicates
a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of Bonds. "P.R."
indicates a bond has been prerefunded. Redemption pursuant to call provisions
generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur
at times when the redeemed Bonds have an offering side evaluation which
represents a premium over par. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in
the Trust at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this
will represent a loss of capital when compared with the original Public
Offering Price of the Units. Conversely, to the extent that the Bonds were
acquired at a price lower than the redemption price, this will represent an
increase in capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of
the Units. Distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the income
which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed Bonds.
Unitholders of record as of the applicable record date will receive
distributions of principal and any premium received on such redemption on the
next applicable distribution date as described in "Rights of
Unitholders--Distributions of Interest and Principal" in Part II. The Estimated
Current Return in this event may be affected by such redemptions. For the
federal tax effect on Unitholders of such redemptions and resultant
distributions, see "Federal Tax Status" in Part II of this Prospectus.






NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued)



Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption
pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed
securities have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over
par. To the extent that the securities were deposited in the Trust at a price
higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a loss of
capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units.
Conversely, to the extent that the securities were acquired at a price lower
than the redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when
compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions
will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise
have been paid with respect to redeemed securities and there will be
distributed to Unitholders the principal amount in excess of $1 per Unit
semi-annually for Trusts with a Date of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, or in
excess of $5 per Unit monthly for Trusts with a Date of Deposit on or after
April 23, 2009, and any premium received on such redemption. However, should
the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account exceed $10.00
per Unit for Trusts with a Date of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, the Trustee
will make a special distribution from the Principal Account on the next
succeeding monthly Distribution Date to holders of record on the related
monthly Record Date. The estimated current return in this event may be affected
by such redemptions. For the federal tax effect on Unitholders of such
redemptions and resultant distributions, see "Federal Tax Status" in Part II of
this Prospectus.


Certain Bonds may have a "make whole" call option and are redeemable in
whole or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price
that is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of such Bonds, a
"make whole" amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
redemption. The "make whole" amount is generally equal to the excess, if any,
of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of principal
being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the
date of redemption) that would have been payable if redemption had not been
made, determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest at a
specified rate (which varies from bond to bond and is generally equal to an
average of yields on U.S. Treasury obligations or municipal obligations, as
applicable, with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the bond
plus a premium rate) from the dates on which the principal and interest would
have been payable if the redemption had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate
principal amount of the bonds being redeemed.


Insurance - Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of
all principal and interest on certain of the securities in the Trust may have
been obtained by the Trust or by one of the Preinsured Security Insurers (as
indicated in the security name), however, certain other securities may not be
insured. Such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the securities
or the value of the Units. For securities covered under the Trust's insurance
policy the insurance is effective only while securities thus insured are held
in the Trust and the insurance premium, which is a Trust obligation, is paid on
a monthly basis. The premium for insurance which has been obtained from various
insurance companies by the issuer of the security involved is payable by the
issuer.


ASC states that, for financial reporting purposes, insurance coverage of the
type acquired by the Trust does not have any measurable fair value in the
absence of default of the underlying Bonds or of indications of the probability
of such default.


Fair Value Measurements - As described in Note 1, the Trust utilizes various
methods to measure the fair value of its investments. ASC establishes both a
framework for measuring fair value as well as a hierarchy that prioritizes
inputs to valuation methods. The various inputs that may be used to determine
the value of the Trust's investments are summarized in the three levels
presented below. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are
not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
securities.


Level 1 -- Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.


Level 2 -- Prices determined using other significant observable inputs.
Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in
pricing a security, which may include quoted prices for similar securities,
interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk.


Level 3 -- Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In
certain situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable,
unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust's own
assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing an
investment, and would be based on the best information available.


The following table summarizes the Trust's investments as of September 30,
2014 based on the inputs used to value them:








                                                       Investments

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued)



Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) at September 30, 2014 is as follows:






Unrealized Appreciation                               $   2,493,521
Unrealized Depreciation                                          --
                                                      -------------
                                                      $   2,493,521
                                                      =============









NOTE 3 - OTHER



Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor may
maintain a market for Units and continuously offer to purchase Units at prices,
subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of the
securities in the portfolio of the Trust, plus interest accrued to the date of
settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for other business
reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the
event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a Unitholder desiring to
dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by tendering such Units to the
Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.


Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate offering price of the securities per
Unit on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a sales charge of 4.9% of the
Public Offering Price which is equivalent to 5.152% of the aggregate offering
price of the securities for the Trust. The secondary market cost to investors
is based on the Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of the
securities per Unit on the date of an investor's purchase plus a sales charge
based upon the estimated long-term return life of the securities in the Trust.
The sales charge ranges from 1.50% of the Public Offering Price (1.523% of the
aggregate bid price of the securities) for a Trust with an estimated long-term
return life with less than two years to 4.80% of the Public Offering Price
(5.042% of the aggregate bid price of the securities) for a Trust with a
portfolio with an estimated long-term return life of fifteen or more years.


Compensation of Evaluator and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.25 per Unit, not to
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to the
Trust). In addition, the Evaluator receives an annual fee for regularly
evaluating the Trust's portfolio. Both fees may be adjusted for increases under
the category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers.






NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS



During each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2014, 2,138
Units, 6,422 Units and 1,236 Units, respectively, were presented for redemption.

THE TRUSTS





General. Each Trust is a unit investment trust issued under the name Invesco
Unit Trust, Taxable Income Series Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series,
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income Series, Van Kampen Merritt Insured
Income Trust, Van Kampen American Capital Insured Income Trust, Van Kampen
Insured Income Trust or Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust. Your
Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust
Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the Date of Deposit among
Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., as Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities
Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor,
and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, or their predecessors.


Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to
participate in a portfolio of taxable fixed income securities, corporate bonds,
or mortgage-backed securities if investing in Units of a GNMA Income Portfolio,
with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.
Diversification of a Trust's assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always
inherent in the ownership of bonds (as used herein, the term "bonds" shall also
include mortgage-backed securities, as applicable to Unitholders of a GNMA
Income Portfolio). In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the
portfolio of a Trust are often not available in small amounts and may, in the
case of any privately placed bonds, be available only to institutional
investors.


On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited the bonds with the Trustee. The
bonds initially consisted of delivery statements relating to contracts for their
purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued
by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds,
delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the Units. A Trust that holds
primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is
referred to herein as a "Long-Term Trust". A Trust that holds primarily
intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is
referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". A Trust that holds a
portfolio of bonds with "laddered" maturities, as described on the cover of
Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a "Laddered Trust". A Trust that
holds only insured bonds is referred to herein as an "Insured Trust". A Trust
that holds primarily short-term Floating and Fixed rate corporate bonds, as
described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a
"Variable Rate Trust". Trusts that primarily hold Build America Bonds, as
described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, are referred to herein as "Build
America Bond Trusts". A Trust that holds bonds within the 10-20 year maturity
range, as described in Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a "10-20 Year
Trust". Unless otherwise terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will
terminate at the end of the calendar year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of
its execution in the case of a Long-Term Trust, a Laddered Trust or a 10-20 Year
Trust and at the end of the calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of
its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust or a Variable Rate
Trust.


Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the
principal and net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed
by the Trustee, or additional Units are issued as a result of additional
Securities being deposited by the Sponsor only with respect to a GNMA Income
Portfolio, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust represented by each Unit
will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual in a Trust will
remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or
until the termination of the Trust Agreement.


With respect only to a GNMA Income Portfolio, additional Units of your Trust
may be issued at any time by depositing in the Trust (i) additional securities,

(ii) contracts to purchase securities together with cash or irrevocable letters
of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit or the equivalent) with
instructions to purchase additional securities. As additional Units are issued
by the Trust, the aggregate value of the securities will be increased and the
fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit will be decreased. The
Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the Trust following the
Initial Date of Deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts
which will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the original percentage
relationship among the principal amounts of securities of specified interest
rates and ranges of maturities that existed on the Initial Date of Deposit.
Investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities
between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because
the Trust will pay the associated brokerage and acquisition costs. Purchases and
sales of Securities by the Trust may impact the value of the Securities. This
may especially be the case upon Trust termination or in the course of satisfying
large Unit redemptions.


Objectives and Bond Selection. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to
provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally
selected portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an
Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by
investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of
intermediate-term bonds. The objective of a 10-20 Year Trust is to provide a
high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio
of bonds maturing approximately 10 to 20 years from the Date of Deposit. The
objective of a Laddered Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital
by investing in a professionally selected portfolio consisting of bonds with
laddered maturities of approximately 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years from the Date
of Deposit. The objective of a Van Kampen BlackRock Corporate Opportunity Trust
("BlackRock Trust") is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve
capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediate-term
corporate bonds. The objective of a GNMA Income Portfolio is to provide an
attractive level of monthly income by investing in a portfolio consisting of
fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities representing pools of mortgages on 1- to
4- family dwellings guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association.
The objective of a Variable Rate Trust is to provide an attractive level of
income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting
of short-term floating and fixed rate corporate bonds. There is, of course, no
guarantee that a Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an
appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of
taxable fixed income securities, corporate bonds, or mortgage-backed securities
if investing in Units of a GNMA Income Portfolio, with greater diversification
than they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's
assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of
bonds.


In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following
factors, among others: (a) as of the Date of Deposit, with respect to Insured
Trusts, the bonds must have a Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") rating
of AAA or a Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating of Aaa, with
respect to Build America Bond Trusts consisting of long-term bonds, the bonds
must have an S&P rating of at least "A-", a Moody's rating of at least "A3" or,
if not rated, credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable
bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a Trust in the
opinion of the Sponsor and with respect to all other trusts, the bonds must have
an S&P rating of at least "BBB-", a Moody's rating of at least "Baa3" or, if not
rated, credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds
that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a Trust in the opinion
of the Sponsor, (b) the prices and liquidity of the bonds relative to other
bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided by the
bonds; (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of
issuer; (e) the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event
risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may
be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. Neither event
requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered in the
Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to dispose of
the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration"). In particular,
the ratings of the bonds in a BlackRock Trust, Income Opportunities Trust,
Investment Grade Trust, Long-Term Investment Grade Trust, Long-Term Corporate
Investment Grade Trust, Intermediate Corporate Investment Grade Trust,
Investment Grade Income Trust or Variable Rate Trust could fall below
"investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") during the Trust's life and
the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. The portfolio for a BlackRock Trust
was selected by the Sponsor from a list of corporate bonds researched and
selected by the BlackRock fixed income team. With respect to the selection of
securities for a GNMA Income Portfolio, the Sponsor considered factors including
the following: (i) the types of GNMA securities available, (ii) the prices and
yields of the securities relative to other comparable securities, including the
extent to which the securities were trading at a premium or discount from their
principal value, and (iii) the maturities of the securities. See "The
Trusts--Risk Factors".


Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and
interest on the bonds in certain Trusts has been obtained from a bond insurance
company. For information relating to insurance on the bonds, see "Insurance on
the Bonds in an Insured Trust". Neither the Public Offering Price nor any
evaluation of Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects any
element of value for the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust unless bonds
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of
such default. See "Public Offering--Offering Price".


In order for bonds to be eligible for insurance, they must have credit
characteristics which would qualify them for at least the S&P rating of "BBB-"
or at least the Moody's rating of "Baa3", which in brief represent the lowest
ratings for securities of investment grade (see "Description of Ratings" in the
Information Supplement). Insurance is not a substitute for the basic credit of
an issuer, but supplements the existing credit and provides additional
security. If an issue is accepted for insurance, a non-cancelable policy for
the prompt payment of interest and principal on the bonds, when due, is issued
by the insurer. A monthly premium is paid by a Trust for the insurance obtained
by it. The Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from a Portfolio
Insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured under the insurance
policy obtained from the respective Portfolio Insurer by a Trust upon the
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the
sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust is eligible to be
sold on an insured basis. All bonds insured by a Portfolio Insurer or by a
Preinsured Bond Insurer receive a "AAA" rating by S&P. S&P describes securities
it rates "AAA" as having "the highest rating assigned by S&P to a debt
obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong."
See "Insurance on the Bonds in an Insured Trust".


Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a
more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.


Current economic conditions. The economic recession in the United States
which began in 2007 technically came to an end in June of 2009, however the U.S.
and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period,
including increased unemployment and below-average levels of economic activity.
The U.S. and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat
the effects of the economic crisis, however the ultimate impact of these
measures is unknown and cannot be predicted. In December of 2013, the U.S.
Federal Reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing
program, however, there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future
changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates
over the previous five years. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Rating
Services downgraded the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States
of America to AA+ from AAA, citing the prolonged controversy over raising the
statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate. Any substantial
change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant
valuation increases or declines in your Trust's holdings.


Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls, or the credit rating
on a bond included in a BlackRock Trust or a Variable Rate Trust is downgraded,
as is possible in a managed fund.


Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are
often more sensitive to interest rate changes. Interest rates in the United
States are at or near historic lows, which may increase your Trust's exposure to
risks associated with rising interest rates. With respect only to a Variable
Rate Trust, because the interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust
periodically to reflect current market rates, falling short-term interest rates
should tend to decrease the income payable to a Variable Rate Trust on its
floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to increase that income.
However, investments in floating rate obligations should also mitigate the
fluctuations in a Variable Rate Trust's net asset values during periods of
changing interest rates, compared to changes in values of fixed-rate debt
securities. Nevertheless, changes in interest rates can affect the value of a
Variable Rate Trust's floating rate investments, especially if rates change
sharply in a short period, because the resets of the interest rates on the
investments occur periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with
changes in prevailing rates.


Credit risk is the risk that a security's issuer is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on the security. While interest and
principal payments on Ginnie Mae securities are backed by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. government, a GNMA Income Portfolio and the Units thereof
are not guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or any government agency.
In addition, neither the U.S. government nor Ginnie Mae guarantees the market
value or yield on Ginnie Mae securities.


Prepayment risk is the chance that borrowers prepay their mortgage loans
earlier than expected and in particular, may affect the Units of a GNMA Income
Portfolio. This reduces the Trust's life and future interest income. Any
payment of mortgage debt before it is due is called "prepayment". Most mortgage
loans may be prepaid at any time by the borrower without penalty. Each
mortgage-backed security payment includes a return of principal as well as
interest. Prepayments of the entire mortgage occur when borrowers refinance or
sell their homes. They may refinance to consolidate debts or take advantage of
lower interest rate mortgages. As interest rates decrease, the rate of
refinancings may increase significantly, thereby increasing the prepayment risk
of mortgage-backed securities. Extra monthly principal payments made near the
Trust's inception may significantly reduce the interest amount paid by the
borrower to the lender and, therefore, the future amount received by the Trust.


Your Trust will distribute prepayments of principal to you but your future
interest distributions will fall as a result of the prepaid principal. You also
might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. This means
that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your Units. If enough
principal is prepaid on the securities in your Trust, your Trust could
terminate significantly earlier than expected.


Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your
units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate
early. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or
mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax
laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other events.
Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy
Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, in particular, are often
subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions. See
"Taxable Municipal Bonds--Build America Bonds" and "Taxable Municipal
Bonds--Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds" below. The call provisions are described in
general terms in the "Redemption Feature" column of the "Portfolio" section, and
the notes thereof in Prospectus Part I.


Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating.


Concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified because
it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of bond makes
up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be "concentrated" in that
bond type. The different bond types are described in the following sections.


A GNMA Income Portfolio concentrates in mortgage-backed securities. You
should understand these securities before you invest. These securities are
described in detail in the section titled "Ginnie Mae Securities."


Extension risk is the chance that an increase in interest rates or lack of
refinancing opportunities can cause a corresponding increase in the Trust's
life due to a drop in expected prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. As a
result, the securities in your Trust, and in particular, any mortgage-backed
securities in a GNMA Income Portfolio, may become more sensitive to rising
interest rates and may decrease in value.


Foreign securities risk. Investing in foreign securities typically involves
more risks than investing in securities of United States issuers. These risks
can increase the potential for losses in the Trust and affect its Unit price.
These risks may include risks such as losses due to political, economic and
social developments, international trade conditions, foreign taxes (including
withholding taxes), restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of
securities, foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or
repatriation of currencies.


The political, economic and social structures of some foreign countries may
be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S., and investments in
these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts,
currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. It is
possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company
or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets.
Some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult
for the Trust to exercise investor rights, and pursue legal remedies with
respect to its foreign investments. Diplomatic and political developments,
including rapid and adverse political changes, social instability, regional
conflicts, terrorism and war, could affect the economies, industries, and
securities and currency markets, and the value of the Trust's investments, in
non-U.S. countries. No one can predict the impact that these factors could have
on the Trust's portfolio securities.


Foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting,
auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. companies.
Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies
than about most U.S. companies.


Certain foreign securities may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more
volatile than many U.S. securities. This means the Trust may at times be unable
to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices.


Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.


Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent, thereby adversely affecting the Trust's net
asset value. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for
any bond because these bonds generally trade in the over-the-counter market
(they are not listed on a securities exchange). Because of the difficulties
currently being experienced by many companies in the financial services
industry, many markets are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity. As a
result of such illiquidity, the Trustee may have to sell other or additional
bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests.


Certain Trusts may hold bonds that are "Rule 144A" restricted securities
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("1933 Act"), and may be
subject to enhanced liquidity risk. Rule 144A securities are restricted
securities that may only be resold in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the 1933 Act. Rule 144A establishes a "safe harbor" from the registration
requirements of the 1933 Act for resale of certain securities to qualified
institutional buyers.


Restricted securities may be sold only in privately negotiated transactions
or in a public offering with respect to a registration statement which is in
effect under the 1933 Act. A restricted security in a Trust may not be readily
marketable at the time such a Trust may be seeking to sell such securities, such
as for a request for redemption. An insufficient number of qualified
institutional buyers interested in purchasing restricted securities held by a
Trust may adversely affect the marketability of such securities, and the Trustee
might be unable to dispose of such Trust securities promptly or at reasonable
prices. Where registration is required for the resale of a restricted security,
a Trust may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a
considerable period may elapse from the time the Trustee attempts to sell such
restricted Trust securities and the time the Trustee may be permitted to sell
the restricted Trust securities under an effective registration statement. Due
to the potential for delays on resale and uncertainty in valuation associated
with restricted securities, the Trustee may experience difficulty satisfying
redemptions within three business days.


Insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could
lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond
both default in making their payment obligations.


Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.


Taxable Municipal Bonds. Your Trust may invest significantly or exclusively
in taxable municipal bonds. States, municipalities and public authorities issue
these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, the
Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose. This section briefly
describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment.
The types of bonds in your Trust are listed in Prospectus Part I. These bonds
are also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement.


General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.


Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.


Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.


Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.


Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local
governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for
a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the
United States Treasury Department ("Treasury") and the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS"), in an amount equal to 35 percent of the total coupon interest payable
to investors (45 percent for those Build America Bonds that qualify and are
designated as Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds).


The Recovery Act adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, (the "Code") which authorizes Build America Bonds that meet the
definition of "qualified bonds", as described below, to receive the refundable
credit. The Code section defines the term "qualified bond" to mean a Build
America Bond (a) issued before January 1, 2011, (b) with 100 percent of the
excess of (i) the available project proceeds (as defined to mean sale proceeds
of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay
issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon), over (ii) the amounts in a
reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue, are to be used for
capital expenditures, and (c) where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to
have this subsection of the Code apply.


Should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on the bonds by the Code, it is possible that such
issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's
ability to make scheduled interest payments. In addition, Build America Bonds
are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to
Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as added by the Recovery Act) or other
federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy
payment for a portion of a Build America Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and
Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively, "Qualified Bonds") are taxable bonds
that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and municipal
Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy payments
from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. The Hiring Incentives to
Restore Employment Act, enacted into federal law on March 18, 2010, permits
issuers of Qualified Bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond interest
payments.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, issued pursuant to provisions in the
Recovery Act, are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair
of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a
bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are both issued pursuant to the "Energy
Improvement and Extension Act of 2008", and like Qualified School Construction
Bonds, are governed by Section 54A of the Code. Qualified Energy Conservation
Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean Renewable
Energy Bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that
produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not restricted for
Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may
be issued for these bond types.


Federal legislation has amended the Code in recent years to provide for
certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of Qualified Bonds, and
to include such bonds under the definition of "qualified tax credit bond" as
found in Section 54A of the Code. Eligible issuers of Qualified School
Construction Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 100% of the lesser of
the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal
tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Eligible issuers of Qualified
Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may receive subsidy
payments equal to 70% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or
the tax credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S.
Treasury.


Should the issuer of a Qualified Bond fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on any such bond by the Code or other federal laws, it
is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments or even
causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds. As provided in Section
54A of the Code, Qualified Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any
portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after
three years from the date of issuance. This mandatory redemption must be
completed within 90 days after such three-year period, unless an extension is
granted by the Treasury. Additionally, Qualified Bonds may be subject to
extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the
Code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash
subsidy payment for any Qualified Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting
appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate
future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments
typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their
budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient
funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.


Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the
need to reduce costs, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).


Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and
government legislation or regulation.


Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or
other regulatory restrictions.


Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or
housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses,
mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of
subsidies.


Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general
risks.


Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use
of the facility.


Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education
financing.


Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.


Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.


Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds,
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability
to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds.


Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.


Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect
operation of a project.


Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal
issuers.


Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government
regulation and rate approvals.


Ginnie Mae Securities. GNMA Income Portfolios invest exclusively in Ginnie
Mae securities. These securities are backed by mortgage loans. These securities
represent an ownership interest in mortgage loans made by banks and other
financial institutions to finance purchases of homes. Individual loans are
pooled together by Ginnie Mae-approved issuers for sale to investors. Commonly
referred to as "pass-through" certificates, these securities entitle an
investor to an undivided interest in the underlying mortgage loan pool. The
investor receives a proportionate share of the interest (reduced by servicing
and guaranty fees) and principal on the underlying mortgage loans.


Payments on Ginnie Mae securities to investors occur monthly. These payments
are called "modified pass-through" payments because, through Ginnie Mae's
mortgage-backed securities program, money is passed from the borrower through
to the investors in the Ginnie Mae securities. It is "modified" because if the
amount collected from the borrowers is less than the amount due, the issuer
modifies the pass-through to add on an amount from its corporate funds to make
the payment complete.


Each group of Ginnie Mae securities shown in the "Portfolio" section of
Prospectus Part I under a specified range of maturities includes individual
mortgage-backed securities which may have varying maturities within each range.
If there is no difference in price among the individual Ginnie Mae securities
within each group on the basis of the difference in the maturity dates of each
security, a purchase of Ginnie Mae securities with the same coupon rate and a
maturity date within the related range will be considered an acquisition of the
same security. In the future, however, the difference in maturity ranges could
affect the market value of the individual Ginnie Mae securities. If this
happens, any additional purchases by your Trust will take into account the
maturities of the individual securities.


The Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae, was
created in 1968 as a wholly owned corporation within the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. Through its mortgage-backed securities program, Ginnie
Mae seeks to increase the liquidity and efficiency of mortgage loan funding,
making more capital available to low and moderate-income homeowners at
competitive interest rates.


The primary function of Ginnie Mae is to operate its mortgage-backed
securities (MBS) program. Ginnie Mae helps to ensure mortgage funds are
available throughout the United States including in rural and urban areas in
which it has been harder to borrow money to buy a home. Ginnie Mae securities
are issued by Ginnie Mae-approved private institutions. The mortgages are
insured by the Federal Housing Administration, or by the Rural Housing Service,
or they are guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.


Because of the Ginnie Mae guaranty, investors in Ginnie Mae securities are
assured timely payments of scheduled principal and interest due on the pooled
mortgages that back their securities. The payments also include any prepayments
and early recoveries of principal on the pooled mortgages. These payments are
guaranteed even if borrowers or issuers default on their obligation. If the
issuer fails to make the payment, Ginnie Mae will make the payment to the
investor. Neither Ginnie Mae nor the U.S. government guarantees or insures (1)
the market value or yields of Ginnie Mae securities, (2) the Trust or (3) the
Units of the Trust in any way.


State Risk Factors. Your Trust may invest significantly in taxable municipal
bonds of issuers from a particular state. The financial condition of a state
may be affected by various national, economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by constitutional
amendments, legislative measures, or voter initiatives on a state and its local
governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain
the revenue-generating capacity of the state and its local governments and,
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their
obligations.


The economic vitality of a state and its various regions and, therefore, the
ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are
affected by numerous factors, such as natural disasters, complications with
exports and industry deregulation.


A state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the state's governmental operations and
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.


Corporate Bond Industry Risks. Your Trust may invest significantly in
certain industries. Any negative impact on the related industry will have a
greater impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio diversified over
several industries. You should understand the risks of these industries before
you invest.


Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Your Trust may invest
significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell various
consumer products. General risks of these companies include the general state
of the economy, intense competition and consumer spending trends. A decline in
the economy which results in a reduction of consumers' disposable income can
negatively impact spending habits. Competitiveness in the retail industry will
require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout
equipment to control inventory, track the sale of items and gauge the success
of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell their products over the Internet have
the potential to access more consumers, but will require sophisticated
technology to remain competitive. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes
can also affect the demand for, and the success of, consumer products and
services in the marketplace.


Financial Services Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by financial services companies. Any negative impact on this industry
will have a greater impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio
diversified over several industries. You should understand the risks of this
industry before you invest.


The effects of the global financial crisis that began to unfold in 2007
continue to manifest in nearly all the sub-divisions of the financial services
industry. Financial losses and write downs among investment banks and similar
institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact of these losses
among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and insurers has
forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation or
combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility of
default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles. Many of
the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance
their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital. In
some cases, the U.S. government has acted to bail out or provide support to
select institutions, however the risk of default by such issuers has nonetheless
increased substantially.


In response to the financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was enacted into federal law on
July 21, 2010, in large part to provide increased regulation of financial
institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act includes significant reforms and refinements to
modernize existing laws to address emerging risks and issues in the nation's
evolving financial system. It also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes,
including in areas such as systemic risk regulation, over-the-counter
derivatives market oversight, and federal consumer protection.


The Dodd-Frank Act will have broad impact on virtually all participants in
the financial services industry for years to come, including banks, thrifts,
depository institution holding companies, mortgage lenders, insurance companies,
industrial loan companies, broker-dealers and other securities and investment
advisory firms, private equity and hedge funds, consumers, and numerous federal
agencies and the federal regulatory structure. These regulatory changes may have
adverse effects on certain issuers in your Trust, such as decreased profits or
revenues. The Sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank
Act, and any resulting regulation, on the securities in your Trust or on the
financial services industry in general.


While the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve Board and
Congress have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with
financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated
with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result
of these steps.


Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse
effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates; portfolio
concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real
estate loans; and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. In
addition, banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both
the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased
regulation. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the availability and
cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates
change or due to increased competition. Economic conditions in the real estate
markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon banks
because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured
by real estate.


Banks face competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory
changes have permitted new entrants to offer various financial products.
Technological advances such as the Internet allow these nontraditional lending
sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data.
Banks continue to face tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms
and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services
that were traditionally offered by banks.


Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the
volatility of the securities markets in general. Adverse changes in the
direction of the securities markets, investor confidence, equity transaction
volume, the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging
markets could adversely affect the financial stability of these companies.
Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition with new
and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses
and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could
adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management
and brokerage industries. Companies involved in investment management and
broker-dealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could
adversely affect such companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management
company profits, including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other
disasters and the effects of client mergers. Already extensively regulated,
insurance companies' profits may be adversely affected by increased government
regulations or tax law changes.


Health Care Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
health care companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced
medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotechnology, managed care, hospital
management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face
substantial government regulation and approval procedures. General risks of
health care companies include extensive competition, product liability
litigation and evolving government regulation.


On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
(incorporating the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, collectively the
"Act") was enacted into law. The Act continues to have a significant impact on
the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a
complex and ongoing process, with varying effective dates. Significant
provisions of the Act include the introduction of required health care coverage
for most Americans, significant expansion in the number of Americans eligible
for Medicaid, modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector,
and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families. The Act also
provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers,
including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to pre-existing
conditions. Although the entirety of the Act will not come into effect until
2018, in the interim, health care companies will face continuing and significant
changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased costs and
changes in the health care market. The Sponsor is unable to predict the full
impact of the Act on the Securities in your Trust.


As illustrated by the Act, Congress may from time to time propose legislative
action that will impact the health care sector. The proposals may span a wide
range of topics, including cost and price controls (which may include a freeze
on the prices of prescription drugs), incentives for competition in the
provision of health care services, promotion of pre-paid health care plans and
additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the health care sector. The
government could also reduce funding for health care related research.


Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, product
obsolescence, increased government regulation, termination of patent protection
for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a product will never come
to market. The research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical
product to market are substantial. This process involves lengthy government
review with no guarantee of approval. These companies may have losses and may
not offer proposed products for several years, if at all. The failure to gain
approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a
company and its stock. The goods and services of health care issuers are also
subject to risks of malpractice claims, product liability claims or other
litigation.


Health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services, the
ability of the facility to provide required services, an increased emphasis on
outpatient services, confidence in the facility, management capabilities,
competitive forces that may result in price discounting, efforts by insurers and
government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost and possible
unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or restriction of
government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or similar
programs).


Industrials Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the
general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and
international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. Capital
goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending
and leverage levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in
modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations,
government regulations, government contracts and e-commerce initiatives.
Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or
retain government contracts, labor disputes, changes in government budget
priorities, changes in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable
business travel. The number of housing starts, levels of public and
non-residential construction including weakening demand for new office and
retail space, and overall construction spending may adversely affect
construction materials and equipment manufacturers.


Technology Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
companies in the technology sector which includes information technology
companies. These companies include those involved in computer and business
services, enterprise software/technical software, Internet and computer
software, Internet-related services, networking and telecommunications
equipment, telecommunications services, electronics products, server hardware,
computer hardware and peripherals, semiconductor capital equipment and
semiconductors. These companies face risks related to rapidly changing
technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving
industry standards and frequent new product introductions.


Companies in this sector face risks from rapid changes in technology,
competition, dependence on certain suppliers and supplies, rapid obsolescence of
products or services, patent termination, frequent new products and government
regulation. These companies can also be adversely affected by interruption or
reduction in supply of components or loss of key customers and failure to comply
with certain industry standards.


An unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on
a company. The failure of a company to introduce new products or technologies or
keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the
company's results. Technology companies may also be smaller and/or less
experienced companies with limited product lines, markets or resources. Stocks
of some Internet companies have high price-to-earnings ratios with little or no
earnings histories. Technology stocks tend to experience substantial price
volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new products,
technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices to
fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume fluctuations
are unrelated to the operating performance of a company. This can impact your
ability to redeem your Units at a price equal to or greater than what you paid.


Telecommunications Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to
substantial governmental regulation. For example, the United States government
and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of
services that a company may offer. This industry has experienced substantial
deregulation in recent years. Deregulation may lead to fierce competition for
market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies. Recent federal
legislation governing the United States telecommunications industry remains
subject to judicial review and additional interpretation, which may adversely
affect the companies whose securities are held by your Trust. Competitive
pressures are intense and values of telecommunications company securities can
experience rapid volatility. Certain telecommunications products may become
outdated very rapidly. A company's performance can be hurt if the company fails
to keep pace with technological advances.


Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have
illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies.
High debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the
1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt and stock prices to trade
at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the
cost of capital for needed additional investment. At the same time, demand for
some telecommunications services has fallen sharply, as several key markets
have become oversaturated, some local customers have switched to substitute
providers and technologies, and corporate profits and the economy generally
remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies may have to commit
substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and
services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have been
compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating
and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines.
Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also faced
scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased
substantially and may continue to rise.


Certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than
larger, established issuers. Smaller companies may have limited product lines,
markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade in lower volumes
than larger companies. As a result, the prices of these securities may
fluctuate more than the prices of securities of other issuers.


Utility and Energy Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by utility and energy companies or in companies related to the utility
or energy industries. Many utility and energy companies, especially electric
and gas and other energy related utility companies, are subject to various
uncertainties, including:


o    risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;


o    restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;


o    regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;


o    coping with the general effects of energy conservation;


o    technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;


o    the effects of local weather, maturing markets and difficulty in
expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors;


o    the potential impact of natural or man-made disasters;


o    difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;


o    the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;


o    difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities; and


o    increased competition.


Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the
supply of or demand for electricity, natural gas, water or other energy, which
could adversely affect the profitability of utility and energy company bond
issuers and the performance of the your Trust.


Utility and energy companies are subject to extensive regulation at the
federal and state levels in the United States. At the federal level, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"), the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (the "NRC") have authority to oversee electric and
combination electric and gas utilities. The value of utility and energy company
stocks may decline because governmental regulation controlling these industries
can change. This regulation may prevent or delay the company from passing along
cost increases to its customers which could hinder the company's ability to meet
its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures,
including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary
bankruptcy proceedings, by its creditors against such company. Furthermore,
regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and other pressures,
may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting or operational
policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's profitability and its
stock price. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial
deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more
similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition
and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original
geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities
may permit certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional
regulated rates of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend
their core business and may be less profitable. Mergers in the these industries
may require approval from several federal and state regulatory agencies,
including FERC, the FTC, and the SEC. These regulatory authorities could, as a
matter of policy, reverse the trend toward deregulation and make consolidation
more difficult, or cause delay in the merger process, any of which could cause
the prices of these stocks to fall.


More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds,
other information about the bonds is also included in the "Portfolio" in
Prospectus Part I and notes thereto. This information relates to other
characteristics of the bonds. This section briefly describes some of these
characteristics.


Floating Rate Bonds. A Variable Rate Trust invests in corporate bonds that
have variable or floating interest rates. A floating rate bond is one whose
terms provide for the readjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified
interest rate changes and which, at any time, can reasonably be expected to have
a market value that approximates its par value. The interest rate on a floating
rate bond may be adjusted automatically according to a stated prevailing market
rate, such as a bank's prime rate, the 91-day U.S. Treasury Bill rate, London
Interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") or some other standard. The instrument's rate
is adjusted automatically each time the base rate is adjusted. For floating rate
bonds, the coupon rate is usually reset each time interest is paid. A reset date
is any date on which the reset takes place based on the value of the index on
that date. The coupon rate is calculated as the reference rate plus a fixed
spread, which depends upon the issuer's credit quality and specifics of how the
instrument is structured. Floating rate bonds are frequently not rated by credit
rating agencies and must satisfy the same quality standards as commercial paper
investments. Floating rate bonds may be secured by bank letters of credit.
Generally, the changes in the interest rate on floating rate obligations reduce
the fluctuation in their market value. As interest rates decrease or increase,
the potential for capital appreciation or depreciation is less than that for
fixed-rate obligations of the same maturity.


Some floating rate obligations have a demand feature that allows a Variable
Rate Trust to tender the obligation to the issuer or a third party prior to its
maturity. The tender may be at par value plus accrued interest, according to the
terms of the obligations. Floating rate demand bonds that have a stated maturity
in excess of one year may have features that permit the holder to recover the
principal amount of the underlying security at specified intervals not exceeding
one year and upon no more than 30 days' notice. The issuer of that type of bond
normally has a corresponding right in its discretion, after a given period, to
prepay the outstanding principal amount of the bond plus accrued interest.
Generally the issuer must provide a specified number of days' notice to the
holder.


Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond
before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.


Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's
par value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par
value.


No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other government agency.



ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS





Except for a variable rate trust, the Estimated Current Return and the
Estimated Long-Term Return are set forth in the Prospectus Part I. Estimated
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and
with the principal prepayment, default (if any), redemption, maturity, exchange
or sale of bonds. The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price
of the bonds. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated
Current Return will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is
calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines
and factors in the relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which
takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts)
and estimated retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses
and sales charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated
retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a Trust will change, and there may
be corporate developments with respect to bonds held by a BlackRock Trust, there
is no assurance that the present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in
the future. The Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are
expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return
reflects the estimated dates and amounts of principal returned on the bonds
while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes only net annual interest
income and Public Offering Price.


In order to calculate estimated returns of a GNMA Income Portfolio and the
estimated average life of the securities, an estimated prepayment rate for the
remaining term of the Trust's mortgage pool must be determined. Each of the
primary market makers in Ginnie Mae securities uses sophisticated computer
models to determine the estimated prepayment rate. These computer models take
into account a number of factors and assumptions including: actual prepayment
data reported by Ginnie Mae for recent periods on a particular pool, the impact
of aging on the prepayment of mortgage pools, the current interest rate
environment, the coupon, the housing environment, historical trends on Ginnie
Mae securities as a group, geographical factors and general economic trends. In
determining the estimated average life of the securities in your Trust, the
Sponsor has relied upon the median of the estimated prepayment rates determined
by primary market makers. No one can be certain that this estimate will prove
accurate or whether the estimated prepayment rates determined by other primary
market makers would have provided a better estimate. Any difference between the
estimate used and the actual prepayment rate will affect the Estimated Long-Term
Return of your Trust.



PUBLIC OFFERING





General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. The secondary
market Public Offering Price is based on the bid prices of the bonds, the sales
charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal Account plus accrued
interest, if any. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may
differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs
in the calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units
purchased. The minimum purchase is one Unit. Certain broker-dealers or selling
firms may charge an order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.


The maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the
following table based upon the estimated long-term return life in years ("ELTR
Life") of your Trust's portfolio:








ELTR Life (Years)             Sales Charge
------------------------------------------
Less than 2 ..................    1.50%
2 but less than 4 ............    2.00
4 but less than 6 ............    3.00

The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above
table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market Public Offering
Price per Unit. For example, the maximum secondary market sales charge for a
Trust with an ELTR Life of "6 but less than 8" years would be 3.50% of the
Public Offering Price per Unit (3.630% of the aggregate bid price of the bonds).


Reducing Your Sales Charge. Employees, officers and directors (including
their spouses (or the equivalent if recognized under local law) and children or
step-children under 21 living in the same household, parents or step-parents and
trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of Invesco
Capital Markets, Inc. and its affiliates and dealers and their affiliates may
purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable dealer
concession. All employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related
selling firm. Only employees, officers and directors of companies that allow
their employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible
for the discounts.


Offering Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The "Evaluation
Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that
the Exchange is open for regular trading or earlier on days where the Bond
Market Association recommends an early bond market close. Orders received by the
Trustee or Sponsor for purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or on a
day when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, will be held until the next
determination of price. The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will
be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary
market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For
secondary market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of
the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption
and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to range
approximately from 0.125% to 1.375% more than the bid price.


The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of the
appropriate bid prices or offering prices, as described herein, (a) on the
basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily
deal in bonds comparable to those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are
not available, on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds; (c)
by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the
practice of evaluation, quoting or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any
combination of the above. Market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate
with changes in market interest rates. Unless bonds are in default in payment
of principal or interest or in significant risk of default, the Evaluator will
not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by your Trust.


The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in
significant risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance
guaranteeing interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will
be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds
assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the
insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of
Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered
by Permanent Insurance. In addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of
a Portfolio Insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy,
including commitments to issue Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed
to insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, as of the date of this
prospectus.


A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid by the bonds semi-annually, although your
Trust accrues interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount
of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with
respect to purchases of Units in the secondary market, the proportionate share
of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering
Price of Units of Series other than those described in the following two
sections. You will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your Units on
the next distribution date. Because of the varying interest payment dates of
the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the
amount of interest actually received by your Trust and distributed to
Unitholders. If a you sell or redeem all or a portion of your Units, you will
be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from
the purchaser of your Units.


Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by broker-dealers
and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest. The Sponsor
intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. Broker-dealers or
others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the
distribution of Units equal to 80% of the sales charge applicable to the
transaction provided that the Units are acquired from the Sponsor. Certain
commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers on an agency
basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal to the
agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the banks.
Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or
agent. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency
commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales charge.


Sponsor Compensation. Broker-dealers will receive a gross sales commission
equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved. See "Public
Offering--General". The Sponsor will receive from the broker-dealers the excess
of this gross sales commission over the amounts set forth in the previous
section.


In addition, the Sponsor may have realized a profit or loss, as a result of
the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the Sponsor and the cost
of the bonds to a Trust. The Sponsor or its affiliates may also have realized
profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the Sponsor from
underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has not
participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds in a Trust were acquired. The
Sponsor may further realize profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations
in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of
Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed, if any) will
be retained by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will also realize profits or losses in
the amount of any difference between the price at which Units are purchased and
the price at which Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary
market for Units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a
redemption of repurchased Units at a price above or below the purchase price.


We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of a Trust and our
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities
designed to promote the sale of a Trust and our other products. Fees may
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for
your Units.


Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to
maintain a market for Units and offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to
change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus
accrued interest and any principal cash on hand, less any amounts representing
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of your Trust and less any
accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of Units exceeds demand or if some other
business reason warrants it, the Sponsor may either discontinue all purchases
of Units or discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not
maintained and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will
be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at
the Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A
Unitholder who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as
to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in
excess of the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will
notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid
in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per
Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.



RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS





Distributions of Interest and Principal. Unitholders who purchase Units in
the secondary market will receive distributions in accordance with the election,
if any, of the prior owner. Interest received by a Trust, pro rated on an annual
basis, will be distributed monthly unless the prior owner of your Units elected
to receive quarterly or semi-annual distributions. Certain Trusts offer only
monthly distribution options while others offer only monthly and semi-annual
distribution options. A Trust that has elected to be structured as a "regulated
investment company" for federal tax purposes may make additional distributions
at the end of each year.


Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee,
without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the
Unitholder of record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be
distributed on each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the
preceding record date. All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. The
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or
Interest Account (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits
from the use of these funds).


For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, funds in the
Principal Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to
Unitholders of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee
is not required to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the
amount available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.
However, should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account
equal or exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution
from the Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders
of record on the related monthly record date.


For a Trust with a Date of Deposit on or after April 23, 2009, should the
amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or exceed
$5.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a distribution from the Principal Account
on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record on the related
monthly record date. However, funds in the Principal Account will be
distributed on the last distribution date of each calendar year to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding record date if the amount available for
distribution shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.


Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, and, with respect only to a Variable Rate Trust, because
the floating rate bonds in a Variable Rate Trust will have varying interest
payment amounts over the life of a Variable Rate Trust, interest distributions
may be more or less than the amount credited to the Interest Account as of the
record date. For the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in interest
distributions, the Trustee is authorized to advance amounts necessary to provide
interest distributions of approximately equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed
for these advances from funds in the Interest Account on the next record date.
Persons who purchase Units between a record date and a distribution date will
receive their first distribution on the second distribution date after the
purchase, under the applicable plan of distribution.


Redemption of Units. All or a portion of your Units may be tendered to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust
Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day
the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be charged by the
Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental
charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem
all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your bank
or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three business
days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will receive an amount for
each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed after receipt by
the Trustee of the tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the
date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that as regards Units
received after the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, the date of tender is the next day on which that Exchange is open and
the Units will be deemed to have been tendered to the Trustee on that day for
redemption at the Redemption Price. Redemption requests received by the Trustee
after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by authorized
financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption requests
received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until after the
time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the next
determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the Trustee on
such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to
transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee so they will be
received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge
an order handling fee for processing redemption requests. Units redeemed
directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.


Under IRS regulations, the Trustee is required to withhold a specified
percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not received the Unitholder's
tax identification number as required by such regulations. Any amount withheld
is transmitted to the IRS and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when
filing a return. Under normal circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's
tax identification number from the selling broker. However, at any time a
Unitholder elects to tender Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide
a tax identification number to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible
"backup withholding".


The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering Price". In determining the
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance
maintained on the bonds in a Trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a description of
the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance obtained by a
Trust, see "Public Offering--Offering Price". Accrued interest paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be
withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.


The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented
by the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When
bonds are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may
be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result
in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full
or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.


In addition, with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series
119 and subsequent series, the Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any
redemption of 1,000 or more Units with an aggregate redemption price of
$1,000,000 or more in an in kind distribution of bonds. An in kind distribution
of bonds will be made by the Trustee through the distribution of each of the
bonds in the Trust in book-entry form to the account of the Unitholder's
broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional
portions of a bond will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the
bonds included in a Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the
distribution of whole bonds. Special tax consequences will result if a
Unitholder receives an in kind distribution. See "Tax Status".


Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Invesco
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial
professional for more information about trusts currently available for
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time. The exchange will
generally be treated as a sale and a taxable transaction for federal and state
income tax purposes.


Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form only and will not
be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or
broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account
of your bank or broker-dealer at the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Units
are transferable by contacting your bank or broker-dealer through which you
hold your Units. Transfer, and the requirements therefore, will be governed by
the applicable procedures of DTC and your agreement with the DTC participant in
whose name your Units are registered on the transfer records of DTC.


Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be
audited annually by an independent registered public accounting firm and the
report of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within
a reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will
furnish to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a
statement describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual
Trust distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust
information. Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the
bonds upon request to the Trustee. If you have any questions regarding your
account or your Trust, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee.
The Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.



INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN AN INSURED TRUST





Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in an Insured Trust. An insurance
policy obtained by an Insured Trust is non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still
in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held by the
Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by the Trust
on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid
by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any policy is
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are
outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The Portfolio
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers, if any, are described in "Portfolio"
in Prospectus Part I and the notes thereto. More detailed information regarding
insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and Portfolio Insurers is
included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional Information".


The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust guarantees the timely
payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due. For this
purpose, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of
principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer defaults in the
payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a bankruptcy
proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the affected
Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal amount of the
bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby retire the bond
from an Insured Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The insurance
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. The
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy has
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond (i.e.,
insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder)
(the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined
insurance premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is
expected that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent
Insurance only if upon exercise the Trust would receive net proceeds in excess
of the sale proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.


Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such
regulation, however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able
to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At
the date hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are
expected to be submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would
materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment
pursuant to any contract of insurance. The information relating to each
Portfolio Insurer has been furnished by such companies. The financial
information with respect to each Portfolio Insurer appears in reports filed
with state insurance regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review
by such authorities. No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or
adequacy of such information or as to the absence of material adverse changes
in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.



TRUST ADMINISTRATION





Sponsor. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The
Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Advisers, Inc. ("Invesco
Advisers"). Invesco Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco
Ltd., a leading independent global investment manager that provides a wide range
of investment strategies and vehicles to its retail, institutional and high net
worth clients around the globe. The Sponsor's principal office is located at 11
Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas 77046-1173. As of December 31, 2014, the total
stockholders' equity of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. was $101,880,982.35
(unaudited). The current assets under management and supervision by Invesco Ltd.
and its affiliates were valued at approximately $792.4 billion as of December
31, 2014.


The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Invesco
Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report
personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect
to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional information about
the Sponsor.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.


Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor,
Brooklyn, New York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. If you have questions
regarding your account or your Trust, please contact the Trustee at its
principal unit investment trust division offices or your financial adviser. The
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New
York Mellon is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of
Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding the
Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's
qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger
involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the
Trustee. See "Additional Information".


Portfolio Administration. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited
circumstances, the Trustee will generally reject (and must reject with respect
to any Trust with a date of deposit on or before August 2, 2006) any offer by an
issuer to issue bonds in exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a
refunding or refinancing plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of
any exchange or substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more
detailed description of circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced.
See "Additional Information".


If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which,
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria
for inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also
instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust
continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and
to avoid imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.


Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must

(i) be long-term, within a 10 to 20 year maturity range, intermediate term or
short-term (as applicable) corporate or taxable municipal bonds, debentures,
notes or other straight debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and
whether senior or subordinated) without equity or other conversion features,
with fixed maturity dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Bonds
having no warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii) be payable in
United States currency; (iii) not be when, as and if issued obligations or
restricted securities; (iv) be issued after July 18, 1984 if the interest is
United States source income; (v) be issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to
or exempt from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or guaranteed,
directly or indirectly, by means of a lease agreement, agreement to buy
securities, services or products, or other similar commitment of the credit of
such an issuer to the payment of the substitute bonds; (vi) maintain the S&P AAA
rating for an Insured Trust and an A rating for a Build America Bonds Trust
consisting of long-term bonds; and (vii) be eligible for (and when acquired be
insured under) the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust. With respect to a
GNMA Income Portfolio, the Replacement Securities must (i) be mortgage-backed
securities of the modified pass-through type issued by the Government National
Mortgage Association which maintain as far as practicable the original
percentage relationship between the principal amounts of Securities of specified
interest rates and ranges of maturity in the Trust, and (ii) not be "when, as
and if issued" obligations or restricted securities. The Trustee shall notify
all Unitholders of a Trust within five days after the acquisition of a
Replacement Bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any,
by which the cost of the Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond
plus accrued interest. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund
the sales charge attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of the
Trust and distribute the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of
the Failed Bonds to the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the
Failed Bonds within 30 days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the
Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated
Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return (if applicable) might be lowered.
Unitholders may not be able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a
yield equal to or in excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.


Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the Trust
Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision which may
be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the
Sponsor and the Trustee) or maintain the tax status of a Trust. The Trust
Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or to permit the
acquisition of bonds in addition to or in substitution for any of the bonds
initially deposited in a Trust, except for the substitution of certain refunding
bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of any amendment.


Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
maturity, prepayment, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the
Trust. A Trust may also be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of
51% of the Units then outstanding (or with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts,
Taxable Income Series 119 and subsequent series, by consent of Unitholders of
75% of the Units then outstanding, and with respect to a GNMA Income Portfolio,
by consent of Unitholders of 66 2 / 3% of the Units then outstanding) or by the
Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% (or with respect to a GNMA
Income Portfolio less than 40%) of the original principal amount of bonds. A
Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient number
of Units of the Trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the
Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would
be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time they
were deposited in the Trust. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder of any
termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any remaining
bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount than
might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For this
reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may
be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".


Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Evaluator, Supervisor and Trustee
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of
the Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee
of any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under
the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for
any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is
not liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations
by the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best
information available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be
under no liability to the Trustee, Sponsor, Supervisor or Unitholders for
errors in judgment.



FEDERAL TAX STATUS






Grantor Trusts



This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of a Trust which has been structured to be taxed as
a grantor trust for federal tax purposes. Please see "Notes to Financial
Statements" in Prospectus Part I. Tax laws and interpretations change
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to
all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a
tax-exempt entity, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,
this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. The
Trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its
compliance and reporting obligations.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Assets of the Trust. Each Trust is expected to hold various debt obligations
(the "Debt Obligations") that are treated as debt for federal income tax
purposes. It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets, including
assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the
assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." Neither our counsel nor
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.


Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue
discount and market discount, and capital gains, if any) from each Trust Asset
when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly
owned the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your
distributions reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from
Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is
not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses.


Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of
your Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize
gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract
your adjusted tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the
total amount received in the transaction. You can generally determine your
initial tax basis in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units,
including sales charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their
values on the date you acquire your Units. In certain circumstances, however,
you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your Units (for
example, in the case of accruals of original issue discount, market discount,
premium and accrued interest, as discussed below).


If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain currently is generally 20%. Dividends and net capital gains also
are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on net investment income for
taxpayers at higher income levels.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as
for ordinary income.


Dividends Received Deduction. Because the Debt Obligations are treated as
debt (not equity) for federal income tax purposes, distributions from the Debt
Obligations are not eligible for the dividends received deduction.


Discount, Accrued Interest and Premium on Debt Obligations. Some Debt
Obligations may have been issued with original issue discount. This generally
means that the Debt Obligations were originally issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. Original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and
generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes. Your
basis of each Debt Obligation that was issued with original issue discount must
be increased as original issue discount accrues.


Some of the Debt Obligations may give their issuers a right to defer
payments on the Debt Obligations. Such Debt Obligations are subject to special
treatment under the original issue discount rules. Among other things, this
treatment may result in you being required to recognize income for federal
income tax purposes in a particular year with respect to a Debt Obligation even
though the actual cash payments on the Debt Obligation have been deferred to a
later year.


Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
market discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated
redemption price at maturity for the Debt Obligation over the purchase price of
the Debt Obligation. Market discount can arise based on the price your Trust
pays for a Debt Obligation or based on the price you pay for your Units. Market
discount is taxed as ordinary income. You will recognize this income when your
Trust receives principal payments on the Debt Obligation, when the Debt
Obligation is disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units.
Alternatively, you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it
accrues. Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate
your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions.


Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any Debt
Obligation, generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable at
maturity, such excess is considered premium. You may elect to amortize premium.
If you make this election, you may reduce your interest income received on the
Debt Obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your tax
basis will be reduced.


If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Debt Obligation,
you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Debt
Obligation. When your Trust receives this accrued interest, you must treat it
as a return of capital and reduce your tax basis in the Debt Obligation.


This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the
discussion set forth above in the case of Debt Obligations that were issued
with original issue discount.


Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over
into a future Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust, it is considered a sale
for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as
capital gain and, in general, any loss will be treated as capital loss. However,
any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your Units of your Trust
for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this
deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have
substantially identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Code.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you
redeem your Units. For an in kind distribution, you will receive Trust Assets
plus, possibly, cash. You will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive
whole Trust Assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata
portion of the same Trust Assets held by your Trust. However, if you also
receive cash in exchange for a Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a Trust
Asset, you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference
between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset
or fractional portion.


Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of
your Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses.
You may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the
same extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat
some or all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including
withholding taxes, on some of the income from your Trust or gain from the sale
or redemption of your Units, provided that certain conditions are met. You
should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in
order to be exempt for U.S. tax purposes. You should also consult your tax
advisor with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and reporting requirements.


Foreign Taxes. Some distributions by your Trust may be subject to foreign
withholding taxes. Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you.
Under the grantor trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your
share of any foreign taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you
may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.


The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Trust's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if paid
to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial
institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due
diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the
foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it identifies certain
of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under
FATCA. Pursuant to the rules above and the applicability of any
intergovernmental agreements between the United States and the relevant foreign
country, withholding under FATCA is required: (i) with respect to distributions
from your Trust and (ii) with respect to certain capital gains distributions and
gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of Units that occur on or after
January 1, 2017. If withholding is required under FATCA on a payment related to
your Units, investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or
that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such
payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to
obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Your Trust will not pay any
additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should
consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual
circumstances.


New York Tax Status. Under the existing income tax laws of the State and
City of New York, your Trust will not be taxed as a corporation, subject to the
New York State franchise tax and the New York City general corporation tax, and
the income of your Trust will pass through to the Unitholders in the same
manner as for federal income tax purposes. You should consult your tax advisor
regarding potential federal, foreign, state or local taxation with respect to
your Units based on your individual circumstances.


Investors in the Trust may be subject to federal, state, local, or foreign
taxes in connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are
encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal,
state, local, and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of
an investment in the Trust.



Regulated Investment Companies



This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of a Trust that has elected to be taxed as a
regulated investment company for federal tax purposes. Please see "Notes to
Financial Statements" in Prospectus Part I. This section is current as of the
date of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and
these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.
For example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you
are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a tax-exempt entity, or
other investor with special circumstances. In addition, this section does not
describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. The
Trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its
compliance and reporting obligations.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Trust Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as
"regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. If a Trust
qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as
provided in the tax law, the Trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.


Distributions. After the end of each year, you will receive a tax statement
that specifies your amount of exempt-interest dividends, ordinary income
distributions and capital gains dividends. Exempt-interest dividends generally
are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes. Some or all
of the exempt-interest dividends, however, may be taken into account in
determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences
(e.g., they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are
taxed). Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your tax rate for
ordinary income. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as
long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares. In
addition, the Trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital
for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status
of your distributions from your Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest
your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash. The income from
your Trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is
not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws
may require you to treat distributions made to you in January as if you had
received them on December 31 of the previous year.


A distribution paid by your Trust reduces the Trust's net asset value per
Unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution. Accordingly, a
distribution paid shortly after a purchase of Units by a Unitholder would be
subject to income tax even though it may be viewed, in substance, as a partial
return on capital.


Dividends Received Deduction and Qualified Dividend Income. A corporation
that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received
deduction with respect to dividends received from the Trust because the
dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from
regulated investment companies that do not invest in stock. An individual who
owns Units generally will not be entitled to treat Trust distributions as
qualified dividend income currently taxed at long-term capital gains rates as it
is not expected that Trust distributions will be attributable to qualified
dividend income received by the Trust.


Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this
gain or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the
amount you receive in the transaction. Your initial tax basis in your Units is
generally equal to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges.
In some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you
purchase your Units. Further, if you hold your Units for six months or less,
any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such a Unit will be
disallowed to the extent of the exempt-interest dividends you received, if
any.


Capital Gains and Losses. If you are an individual, the maximum marginal
federal tax rate for net capital gain under current law is generally 20%. State
and local taxes may also apply.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your Unit at a loss after
holding it for six months or less, the loss will be disallowed to the extent of
the exempt-interest dividends you received. To the extent, if any, it is not
disallowed, it will be recharacterized as long-term capital loss to the extent
of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for capital gains realized
from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary
income.


Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over
into a future invesco-sponsored unit investment trust, the exchange would
generally be considered a sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax
purposes. In general, any gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and
any loss will be treated as capital loss. However, any loss realized on a sale
or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that Units disposed of are replaced
(including through reinvestment of dividends) within a period of 61 days
beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of Units or to
the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or enters into an
option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities. In
such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the
disallowed loss.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you
redeem your Units. This distribution will be treated as a sale for federal
income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss, generally
based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash
received, and subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses
under the tax rules.


Foreign Tax Credit. If your Trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your Trust
paid to other countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your Trust paid to other countries. However, it is not
expected that any such Trust investing in foreign securities will be eligible
to pass through to investors any credits or deductions against U.S. federal
income tax with respect to such foreign taxes paid.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from the Trust will be characterized as dividends for federal
income tax purposes (other than dividends which the Trust reports as capital
gain dividends) and will generally be subject to U.S. income taxes, including
withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions. However distributions received
by a foreign investor from the Trust that are properly reported by the Trust as
capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes,
including withholding taxes, provided that the Trust makes certain elections and
certain other conditions are met. The amount of distributions that may be
reported as interest-related dividends will be limited to the amount of
qualified net interest income, which is generally the Trust's U.S.-source
interest income less allocable expenses.


Backup Withholding. By law, your Trust must withhold as backup withholding a
percentage of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds if you do not
provide your correct social security or taxpayer identification number and
certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or if the IRS instructs
your Trust to do so.


Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, expenses incurred by your Trust
will be deducted from the gross income received by your Trust and only your
share of the Trust's net taxable income, if any, will be paid to you and
reported as taxable income to you. However, if the Units of your Trust are held
by fewer than 500 Unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your Trust will
generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus resulting in
your reported share of your Trust's taxable income being increased by your share
of those expenses, even though you do not receive a corresponding cash
distribution. In this case you may be able to take a deduction for these
expenses; however, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment
expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these
deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income. Such deductions
may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain levels.


Investors in the Trust may be subject to federal, state, local, or foreign
taxes in connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are
encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal,
state, local, and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of
an investment in the Trust.


The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Trust's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if paid
to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial
institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due
diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the
foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it identifies certain
of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under
FATCA. Withholding under FATCA is required: (i) with respect to certain
distributions from your Trust beginning on July 1, 2014; and (ii) with respect
to certain capital gains distributions and gross proceeds from a sale or
disposition of Units that occur on or after January 1, 2017. If withholding is
required under FATCA on a payment related to your Units, investors that
otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or that otherwise would be
entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such payment generally will be
required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to obtain the benefit of such
exemption or reduction. Your Trust will not pay any additional amounts in
respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should consult your tax advisor
regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual circumstances.





EXPENSES





General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation,
printing and execution of the Trust Agreement, legal and accounting expenses,
advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial evaluation
fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor at no cost
to the Trusts.


Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Invesco unit investment trusts will not exceed the total
cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will receive
the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's portfolio. For its
services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be reduced as described
therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its services is expected to
result from the use of the funds being held in the Principal and Interest
Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions since
these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders. These fees are based on
the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on the Date of Deposit for
the first year and as of the close of business on January 1 for each year
thereafter. The Sponsor's, Supervisor's, Evaluator's and Trustee's fees may be
increased without approval of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding
proportionate increases under the category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in
the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers or, if this category is not
published, in a comparable category.


Insurance. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of an
Insured Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As
bonds covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed
by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the
premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the
right to obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent
insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related
bonds.


Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b)
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts
without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any
special custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds
in a Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon
termination of the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for
advancing funds to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may
be adjusted periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest
rates). A BlackRock Trust will pay a license fee to BlackRock Financial
Management, Inc. for use of certain trademarks and other property. Each Trust
will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement each
year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such
amounts.

Risk Factors



The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor
nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect
in any of the bonds.


Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Certain Trusts may
invest significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell
consumer products. The profitability of these companies will be affected by
various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer
spending trends. In the past, there have been major changes in the retail
environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major
corporations involved in the retail industry, particularly the department store
segment. The continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the
industry's ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social
conditions, to attract and retain capable management, and to finance expansion.
Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a recessionary economic
climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth, less favorable
trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal
income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and
consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending habits. In addition,
competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for
investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control
inventory, to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of
sales campaigns. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect
the demand for, and the success of, consumer products and services in the
marketplace. Increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an
adverse effect on the industry. In many sectors of the retail industry,
competition may be fierce due to market saturation, converging consumer tastes
and other factors. Because of these factors and the recent increase in trade
opportunities with other countries, American retailers are now entering global
markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies,
difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research
costs.


Financial Services Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by companies within the bank and financial services sector.


The effects of the sub-prime mortgage crisis that began to unfold in 2007
continue to manifest in nearly all the sub-divisions of the financial services
industry. Sub-prime mortgage related losses and write downs among investment
banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact
of these losses among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and
insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation
or combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility
of default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles.
Many of the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to
finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity
capital. In some cases, the U.S. government has acted to bail out or provide
support to select institutions, however the risk of default by such issuers has
nonetheless increased substantially.


While the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve Board and
Congress have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with
financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated
with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result
of these steps.


Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly
dependent on net interest margin. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the
availability and cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when
interest rates change or due to increased competition. As initial home
purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest
rates and other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in the real
estate markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon
banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans
secured by real estate. Banks and their holding companies are subject to
extensive federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to
state regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements
and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may
pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in
connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may
substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if
deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the
safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as
increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases
in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings
and the ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of
deposits nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or
profitability of banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk
of investment in the securities issued by such institutions.


The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks
and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone
substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes are
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act;
enacted in August 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. Many of the
regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been
finalized and their impact on the business, financial condition and prospects
of the securities in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act financial-services overhaul legislation allows
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to
investors. This legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and
heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field.
Legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law in recent
years, allowing banks to be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in
any state. Since mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into
branches. Consolidation is likely to continue. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") and the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the
expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules
requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts
or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in
increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and mandated
regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional legislative and
regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory
authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act
and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as
to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the bonds in the Trust's
portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system is
reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that
system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in which deposited
moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits
insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce profitability, as
investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and
as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face
significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds,
credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance companies, and
increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and
national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such legislation
allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited
state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit.
Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any prediction as to what, if
any, manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what
ultimate effect such actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.


The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve,
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.


The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view
that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay
cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in
ways that would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also
may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its
approval of certain applications, including applications for approval of
mergers and acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any
prediction as to the effect, if any, such laws will have on the bonds or
whether such approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.


Companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and competition
from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes in the direction
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the prices of the
securities, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies
involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive
regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and
changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such laws,
regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management
company profits, including but not limited to interest rate movements, the
imposition of premium rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in
given underwritings, competition and pressure to compete globally, weather
catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology
and the pressure to compete globally.


In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors,
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;


o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be
expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;


o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;


o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;


o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and


o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.


The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have
considered or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company
systems. Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")
and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations,
specifically focusing on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws
and the development of new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal
agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the
United States to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation.
The Sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will
be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance
industry, or what effect, if any, such legislation would have on the industry.


All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some
instances, would require divestiture.


Health Care Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
companies within the health care sector. Health care companies involved in
advanced medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care,
hospital management/health services and medical supplies have potential risks
unique to their sector of the health care field. These companies are subject to
governmental regulation of their products and services, a factor which could
have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and
availability of such products or services. Furthermore, such companies face the
risk of increasing competition from new products or services, generic drug
sales, termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and
the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete. The
research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial,
and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the
product will ever come to market. Many of these companies may have losses and
not offer certain products for several years. Such companies may also have
persistent losses during a new product's transition from development to
production, and revenue patterns may be erratic. The goods and services of
health care issuers are also subject to risks of product liability litigation.


Health care facility operators may be affected by events and conditions
including, among other things, demand for services, the ability of the facility
to provide the services required, physicians' confidence in the facility,
management capabilities, competition with other hospitals, efforts by insurers
and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing state
rate-setting agencies, expenses, government regulation, the cost and possible
unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of
governmental financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare,
Medicaid and other similar third-party payor programs.


Legislative proposals concerning health care are proposed in Congress from
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision
of health care services, tax incentives and penalties related to health care
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid health care plans. The government
could also reduce funding for health care related research. The Sponsor is
unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the
issuers of Securities in your Trust.


Industrials Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the
general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and
international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. In
addition, capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall
capital spending levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in
modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations,
government regulations, government contracts and ecommerce initiatives.
Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or
retain government contracts, labor disputes or changes in government budget
priorities, changes in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable
business travel. The number of housing starts, levels of public and
non-residential construction including weakening demand for new office and
retail space, and overall construction spending may adversely affect
construction equipment manufacturers.


Technology Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
issuers within the technology industry which includes information technology
companies. Your Trust, and therefore Unitholders, may be particularly
susceptible to a negative impact resulting from adverse market conditions or
other factors affecting technology issuers because any negative impact on the
technology industry will not be diversified among issuers within other unrelated
industries. Accordingly, an investment in Units should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of the information technology industry and
the risks which such an investment may entail.


Technology companies generally include companies involved in the development,
design, manufacture and sale of computers, computer related equipment, computer
networks, communications systems, telecommunications products, electronic
products, and other related products, systems and services. The market for
technology products and services, especially those specifically related to the
Internet, is characterized by rapidly changing technology, rapid product
obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent
new product introductions. The success of the issuers of the Securities depends
in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of new products.
An unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuer's
products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could
have a material adverse affect on an issuer's operating results. Furthermore,
there can be no assurance that the issuers of the Securities will be able to
respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace.


The market for certain technology products and services may have only
recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain technology companies
may have only recently commenced operations or offered securities to the public.
Such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited
operating history on which to analyze future operating results. It is important
to note that following its initial public offering a security is likely to
experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that upon redemption of Units or termination of a
Trust a Unitholder will receive an amount greater than or equal to the
Unitholder's initial investment.


Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to
fluctuate substantially. Market volatility may adversely affect the market price
of the Securities and therefore the ability of a Unitholder to redeem units, or
roll over Units into a new trust, at a price equal to or greater than the
original price paid for such Units.


Some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently
available only from single sources. There can be no assurance that in the future
suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and cost
effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results and customer
relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for, or
and interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally,
many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product
vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards.
Any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or
reduction of sales. Because many products and technologies are incorporated into
other related products, certain companies are often highly dependent on the
performance of other computer, electronics and communications companies. There
can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that
an issuer of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders
form other customers. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a
relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense
competition between companies. Accordingly, a decline in demand of such
products, technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse
impact on issuers of the Securities.


Telecommunications Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by telecommunications companies. The telecommunications industry is
subject to governmental regulation, and the products and services of
telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence. These
factors could affect the value of Units. Telephone companies in the United
States, for example, are subject to both state and federal regulations
affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be
offered. Certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in
fierce competition for a share of the market of their products. As a result,
competitive pressures are intense and the values of telecommunications company
securities are subject to rapid price volatility.


Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have
illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies.
High debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the
1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt and stock prices to trade
at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the
cost of capital for needed additional investment. At the same time, demand for
some telecommunications services has fallen sharply, as several key markets
have become oversaturated, some local customers have switched to substitute
providers and technologies, and corporate profits and the economy generally
remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies may have to commit
substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and
services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have been
compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating
and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines.
Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also faced
scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased
substantially and may continue to rise.


While a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers
of traditional telecommunication products and services, a Trust may also invest
in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the
development of new products and services. These smaller companies may present
greater opportunities for capital appreciation, and may also involve greater
risk than large, established issuers. Such smaller companies may have limited
product lines, market or financial resources, and their securities may trade
less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger, more
established companies. As a result, the prices of the securities of such
smaller companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of
securities of other issuers.


In addition, recent federal legislation governing the United States
telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional
interpretation, which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are
held by a Trust.


Utility and Energy Issuers. Because certain Trusts may invest significantly
in bonds issued by public utility and energy companies, an investment in Units
of certain Trusts should be made with an understanding of the characteristics
of the public utility and energy industries and the risks which such an
investment may entail. General problems of the public utility and energy
industries include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on invested
capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by the
public service commissions having jurisdiction, the difficulty in financing
large construction programs during an inflationary period, the restrictions on
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental, nuclear
safety and other regulatory considerations, the difficulty of the capital
markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities, the difficulty in
obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, regulatory
restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the
retail and business customer, and the effects of energy conservation. There is
no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the
future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating
and other expenses and debt service requirements. All of the public utilities
which are issuers of securities in certain Trusts have been experiencing many
of these problems in varying degrees. Furthermore, utility and energy stocks
are particularly susceptible to interest rate risk, generally exhibiting an
inverse relationship to interest rates. As a result, electric utility stock
prices may be adversely affected as interest rates rise. Similarly, the success
of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or
technologies with intense competition between companies. There can be no
assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that an issuer
of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other
customers. Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or
from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of
securities in certain Trusts.


Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, for example, establish the rates which may be charged and
the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base, which must be
approved by the state commissions. Certain utilities have had difficulty from
time to time in persuading regulators, who are subject to political pressures,
to grant rate increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment.
Any unexpected limitations could negatively affect the profitability of
utilities whose budgets are planned far in advance. In addition, gas pipeline
and distribution companies have had difficulties in adjusting to short and
surplus energy supplies, enforcing or being required to comply with long-term
contracts and avoiding litigation with their customers, on the one hand, or
suppliers, on the other.


Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in
recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial
companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been
permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic
regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities may permit
certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates
of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend their core business
and may be less profitable.


Certain of the issuers of securities in certain Trusts may own or operate
nuclear generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time
review existing, and impose additional, requirements governing the licensing,
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear generating projects
in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases,
construction delays and licensing difficulties. These have been caused by
various factors, including inflation, high financing costs, required design
changes and rework, allegedly faulty construction, objections by groups and
governmental officials, limits on the ability to finance, reduced forecasts of
energy requirements and economic conditions. This experience indicates that the
risk of significant cost increases, delays and licensing difficulties remain
present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear
project. Also, nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned
outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new
regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining
regulatory approval to return to service. A major accident at a nuclear plant
anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation,
construction or licensing of nuclear units.


In view of the uncertainties discussed above, there can be no assurance that
any utility company's share of the full cost of nuclear units under
construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a
company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units. The
likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of
concern described above varies, as does the potential severity of any adverse
impact. It should be recognized, however, that one or more of such adverse
events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material
adverse impact on a company's financial condition, the results of its
operations, its ability to make interest and principal payments on its
outstanding debt or to pay dividends.


Other general problems of the electric, gas and water utility industries
(including state and local joint action power agencies) include rising costs of
rail transportation to transport fossil fuels, the uncertainty of transmission
service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions, changes in tax
laws which adversely affect a utility's ability to operate profitably,
increased competition in service costs, recent reductions in estimates of
future demand for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country,
restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to
environmental considerations, uncertain availability and increased cost of
capital, unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices,
including the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with
conversion to alternate fuel sources such as coal, availability and cost of
natural gas for resale, technical and cost factors and other problems
associated with construction, licensing, regulation and operation of nuclear
facilities for electric generation, including, among other considerations, the
problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of
radioactive wastes, and the effects of energy and environmental conservation
efforts. Each of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of
the issuers of any utility and energy bonds to make dividend payments and the
value of such issues on redemption of your Units.


Taxable Municipal Issues. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be
either general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing
power of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific
project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy
taxes.


General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.


Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.


Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.


Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.


Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local
governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for
a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the
Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") in an amount equal
to 35 percent of the total coupon interest payable to investors (45 percent for
those Build America Bonds that qualify and are designated as Recovery Zone
Economic Development Bonds).


The Recovery Act adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, (the "Code") which authorizes Build America Bonds that meet the
definition of "qualified bonds", as described below, to receive the refundable
credit. The Code section defines the term "qualified bond" to mean a Build
America Bond (a) issued before January 1, 2011, (b) with 100 percent of the
excess of (i) the available project proceeds (as defined to mean sale proceeds
of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay
issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon), over (ii) the amounts in a
reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue, are to be used for
capital expenditures, and (c) where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to
have this subsection of the Code apply.


Should a Build America Bond issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, it is
possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments. In addition,
Build America Bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event
that changes to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as added by the Recovery Act)
or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash
subsidy payment for a portion of a Build America Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and
Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively, "Qualified Bonds") are taxable bonds
that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and municipal
Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy payments
from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. The Hiring Incentives to
Restore Employment Act, enacted into federal law on March 18, 2010, permits
issuers of Qualified Bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond interest
payments.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, issued pursuant to provisions in the
Recovery Act, are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair
of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a
bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are both issued pursuant to the "Energy
Improvement and Extension Act of 2008", and like Qualified School Construction
Bonds, are governed by Section 54A of the Code. Qualified Energy Conservation
Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean Renewable
Energy Bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that
produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not restricted for
Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may
be issued for these bond types.


Federal legislation has amended the Code in recent years to provide for
certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of Qualified Bonds, and
to include such bonds under the definition of "qualified tax credit bond" as
found in Section 54A of the Code. Eligible issuers of Qualified School
Construction Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 100% of the lesser of
the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal
tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Eligible issuers of Qualified
Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may receive subsidy
payments equal to 70% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or
the tax credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S.
Treasury.


Should the issuer of a Qualified Bond fail continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on any such bond by the Code or other federal laws, it
is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments or even
causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds. As provided in Section
54A of the Code, Qualified Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any
portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after
three years from the date of issuance. This mandatory redemption must be
completed within 90 days after such three-year period, unless an extension is
granted by the Treasury. Additionally, Qualified Bonds may be subject to
extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the
Code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash
subsidy payment for any Qualified Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.


Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the
need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).


Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and
government legislation or regulation.


Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or
other regulatory restrictions.


Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or
housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses,
mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of
subsidies.


Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general
risks.


Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use
of the facility.


Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education
financing.


Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.


Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.


Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds,
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.


Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.


Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect
operation of a project.


Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal
issuers.


Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government
regulation and rate approvals.


Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon"
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount
bond, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at
higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to
substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market
interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.


Ginnie Mae Securities. The Ginnie Mae securities included in a GNMA Income
Portfolio are backed by the indebtedness secured by underlying mortgage pools
of up to 30 year mortgages on 1- to 4-family dwellings. The securities are
often referred to simply as "Ginnie Maes." The pool of mortgages which is to
underlie a particular new issue of Ginnie Mae securities is assembled by the
proposed issuer of such Ginnie Mae securities. The issuer is typically a
mortgage banking firm, and in every instance must be a mortgagee approved by
and in good standing with the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"). In
addition, Ginnie Mae imposes its own criteria on the eligibility of issuers,
including a net worth requirement.


The mortgages which are to comprise a new Ginnie Mae pool may have been
originated by the issuer itself in its capacity as a mortgage lender or may be
acquired by the issuer from a third party, such as another mortgage banker, a
banking institution, the Veterans Administration ("VA") (which in certain
instances acts as a direct lender and thus originates its own mortgages) or one
of several other governmental agencies. All mortgages in any given pool will be
insured under the National Housing Act, as amended ("FHA-insured"), or Title V
of the Housing Act of 1949 ("FMHA Insured") or guaranteed under the Servicemen's
Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended, or Chapter 37 of Title 38, U.S.C.
("VA-guaranteed"). Such mortgages will have a date for the first scheduled
monthly payment of principal that is not more than one year prior to the date on
which Ginnie Mae issues its guaranty commitment as described below, will have
comparable interest rates and maturity dates, and will meet additional criteria
of Ginnie Mae. All mortgages in the pools backing the Ginnie Mae securities
contained in the Trust are mortgages on 1- to 4-family dwellings (having a
stated maturity of up to 30 years for securities in the Trust but an estimated
average life of considerably less. In general, the mortgages in these pools
provide for equal monthly payments over the life of the mortgage (aside from
prepayments) designed to repay the principal of the mortgage over such period,
together with interest at the fixed rate on the unpaid balance.


To obtain Ginnie Mae approval of a new pool of mortgages, the issuer will
file with Ginnie Mae an application containing information concerning itself,
describing generally the pooled mortgages, and requesting that Ginnie Mae
approve the issue and issue its commitment (subject to Ginnie Mae's
satisfaction with the mortgage documents and other relevant documentation) to
guarantee the timely payment of principal of and interest on the Ginnie Mae
securities to be issued by the issuer. If the application is in order, Ginnie
Mae will issue its commitment and will assign a Ginnie Mae pool number to the
pool. Upon completion of the required documentation (including detailed
information as to the underlying mortgages, a custodial agreement with a
Federal or state regulated financial institution satisfactory to Ginnie Mae
pursuant to which the underlying mortgages will be held in safekeeping, and a
detailed guaranty agreement between Ginnie Mae and the issuer), the issuance of
the Ginnie Mae securities is permitted. When the Ginnie Mae securities are
issued, Ginnie Mae will endorse its guarantee thereon. The aggregate principal
amount of Ginnie Mae securities issued will be equal to the then aggregate
unpaid principal balances of the pooled mortgages. The interest rate borne by
the Ginnie Mae securities is currently fixed at 1/2 of 1% below the interest
rate of the pooled 1- to 4-family mortgages, the differential being applied to
the payment of servicing and custodial charges as well as Ginnie Mae's guaranty
fee.


Ginnie Mae IIs consist of jumbo pools of mortgages from more than one
issuer. By allowing pools to consist of multiple issuers, it allows for larger
and more geographically diverse pools. Unlike Ginnie Mae Is, which have a
minimum pool size of $1 million, Ginnie Mae IIs have a minimum pool size of $7
million. In addition, the interest rates on the mortgages within the Ginnie Mae
II pools will vary unlike the mortgages within pools in Ginnie Mae Is which all
have the same rate. The rates on the mortgages will vary from 1/2 of 1% to
1.50% above the coupon rate on the Ginnie Mae security, which is allowed for
servicing and custodial fees as well as the Ginnie Mae's guaranty fee. The
major advantage of Ginnie Mae IIs lies in the fact that a central paying agent
sends one check to the holder on the required payment date. This greatly
simplifies the current procedure of collecting distributions from each issuer
of a Ginnie Mae, since such distributions are often received late.


All of the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust, including the Ginnie Mae IIs,
are of the "fully modified pass-through" type, i.e., they provide for timely
monthly payments to the registered holders thereof (including the Trust) of
their pro rata share of the scheduled principal payments on the underlying
mortgages, whether or not collected by the issuers, including, on a pro rata
basis, any prepayments of principal of such mortgages received and interest
(net of the servicing and other charges described above) on the aggregate
unpaid principal balance of such Ginnie Mae securities, whether or not the
interest on the underlying mortgages has been collected by the issuers.


The Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust are guaranteed as to timely payment of
principal and interest by Ginnie Mae. Funds received by the issuers on account
of the mortgages backing the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust are intended to
be sufficient to make the required payments of principal of and interest on such
Ginnie Mae securities but, if such funds are insufficient for that purpose, the
guaranty agreements between the issuers and Ginnie Mae require the issuers to
make advances sufficient for such payments. If the issuers fail to make such
payments, Ginnie Mae will do so.


Ginnie Mae is authorized by Section 306(g) of Title III of the National
Housing Act to guarantee the timely payment of and interest on securities which
are based on or backed by a Trust or pool composed of mortgages insured by FHA,
the Farmers' Home Administration ("FMHA") or guaranteed by the VA. Section
306(g) provides further that the full faith and credit of the United States is
pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under
any guaranty under such subsection. An opinion of an Assistant Attorney General
of the United States, dated December 9, 1969, states that such guaranties
"constitute general obligations of the United States backed by its full faith
and credit." Any statement that a particular security is backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States is based upon the opinion of an assistant
attorney general of the United States and should be so construed. Ginnie Mae is
empowered to borrow from the United States Treasury to the extent necessary to
make any payments of principal and interest required under such guaranties.


Ginnie Mae securities are backed by the aggregate indebtedness secured by
the underlying FHA-insured, FMHA-insured or VA-guaranteed mortgages and, except
to the extent of funds received by the issuers on account of such mortgages,
Ginnie Mae securities do not constitute a liability of nor evidence any
recourse against such issuers, but recourse thereon is solely against Ginnie
Mae. Holders of Ginnie Mae securities (such as the Trust) have no security
interest in or lien on the underlying mortgages.


The Ginnie Mae guaranties referred to herein relate only to payment of
principal of and interest on the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust and not to
the Units offered hereby.


Monthly payments of principal will be made, and additional prepayments of
principal may be made, to each Trust in respect of the mortgages underlying the
Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust. All of the mortgages in the pools relating
to the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust are subject to prepayment without any
significant premium or penalty at the option of the mortgagors. While the
mortgages on 1- to 4-family dwellings underlying the Ginnie Mae securities have
a stated maturity of up to 30 years for the Trust, it has been the experience
of the mortgage industry that the average life of comparable mortgages, owing
to prepayments, refinancings and payments from foreclosures, is considerably
less.


In the mid-1970's, published yield tables for Ginnie Mae securities utilized
a 12- year average life assumption for Ginnie Mae pools of 26-30 year mortgages
on 1- to 4-family dwellings. This assumption was derived from the FHA
experience relating to prepayments on such mortgages during the period from the
mid-1950's to the mid-1970s. This 12-year average life assumption was
calculated in respect of a period during which mortgage lending rates were
fairly stable. The assumption is no longer an accurate measure of the average
life of Ginnie Mae Securities or their underlying single family mortgage pools.
Recently it has been observed that mortgages issued at high interest rates have
experienced accelerated prepayment rates which would indicate a significantly
shorter average life than 12 years. Today, research analysts use complex
formulae to scrutinize the prepayments of mortgage pools in an attempt to
predict more accurately the average life of Ginnie Mae Securities.


A number of factors, including homeowner's mobility, change in family size
and mortgage market interest rates will affect the average life of the Ginnie
Mae securities in the Trust. For example, Ginnie Mae securities issued during a
period of high interest rates will be backed by a pool of mortgage loans bearing
similarly high rates. In general, during a period of declining interest rates,
new mortgage loans with interest rates lower than those charged during periods
of high rates will become available. To the extent a homeowner has an
outstanding mortgage with a high rate, he may refinance his mortgage at a lower
interest rate or he may rapidly repay his old mortgage. Should this happen, a
Ginnie Mae issued with a high interest rate may experience a rapid prepayment of
principal as the underlying mortgage loans prepay in whole or in part.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prepayment levels which will be
actually realized will conform to the estimates or experience of the FHA, other
mortgage lenders, dealers or market makers or other Ginnie Mae investors. It is
not possible to meaningfully predict prepayment levels regarding the Ginnie Mae
securities in the Trust. The termination of the Trust might be accelerated as a
result of prepayments made as described herein.



Insurance on the Bonds



Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
certain Trusts, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior to the
deposit of such bonds in a Trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in such Insured Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. Each insurance policy
obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is non-cancelable and will continue in
force so long as such Insured Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio
Insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to
be held by such Insured Trust (see "Portfolio" for the Trust in the Prospectus
Part I). Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained by an Insured Trust will
not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take
action against the Trustee to recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in
turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such Insured Trust. Premium
rates for each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an Insured
Trust are fixed for the life of an Insured Trust. The premium for any insurance
policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer,
and any such policy or policies are non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Portfolio Insurer
remains in business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy
is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned
to the claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio
Insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of
the above described events.


The aforementioned Trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of
principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due. For the purposes of the
Portfolio Insurance, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for
the payment of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a
bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such
issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is
accelerated, the Portfolio Insurer involved has the option, in its sole
discretion, for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest
to occur of such a default, bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the
outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of
such payment and thereby retire the bond from an Insured Trust prior to such
bond's stated maturity date. The insurance does not guarantee the market value
of the bonds or the value of the Units. Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust
is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such Insured Trust. In the
event of a sale of any such bond by the Trustee, such insurance terminates as
to such bond on the date of sale.


Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy
obtained by an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with
respect to such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of
the identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related
thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an
Insured Trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that
the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon
such exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond
proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the
Permanent Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such
bonds were sold on an uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to
each bond eligible for Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the
insurability of each bond as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased
or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond.


The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by an Insured Trust
insurance policy may be sold out of the Insured Trust with the benefits of the
insurance attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the
time of sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is
not the case in connection with any value attributable to such Insured Trust's
portfolio insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the Prospectus
Part II. Because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of
the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option,
the Sponsor anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be
comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of
default, it is much less likely that the Insured Trust would need at some point
in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of Units than if the Insured Trust
were to have no such option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in
the Prospectus Part II) and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust,
if the Insured Trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk
of default, the Insured Trust would not need to hold such bonds until their
respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the Insured Trust's
portfolio insurance. (See "Trust Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement"
in the Prospectus Part II.)


Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of
the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of a
bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant
risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent

purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bond not
covered by Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the
Prospectus Part II for a more complete description of an Insured Trust's method

ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). ACA Financial
Guaranty is organized and domiciled in the State of Maryland. Since December
2007, ACA Financial Guaranty has not issued any new financial guaranty insurance
policies and is currently operating as a runoff insurance company.


On August 8, 2008, ACA Financial Guaranty and counterparties to its
structured finance products reached an agreement on a restructuring plan for ACA
Financial Guaranty. The plan, approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration,
provided for settlement of the structured finance obligations and protection for
ACA Financial Guaranty's municipal policyholders. The settlement required that
ACA Financial Guaranty make a $209 million cash payment and a distribution of
surplus notes. The surplus notes provide the former collateralized debt
obligation ("CDO") counterparties and certain other counterparties with
approximately a 95% economic interest in ACA Financial Guaranty. ACA Financial
Guaranty continues to operate as a runoff insurance company and focus on
actively monitoring its remaining insured municipal obligations.


As of September 30, 2012, ACA Financial Guaranty had total admitted assets of
$436.3 million and total liabilities of $328.7 million, resulting in a surplus
as regards policyholders of $107.6 million.


On December 15, 2008, S&P raised the financial strength, financial
enhancement, and issuer credit ratings on ACA Financial Guaranty to B from CCC,
with a developing outlook. The upgrade reflected the positive effects of the
restructuring transaction completed in August 2008 that settled all outstanding
CDO and reinsurance exposures of the company, including the significantly
deteriorated CDO of asset-backed securities ("ABS") transactions, eliminating a
requirement to post a significant amount of collateral to the CDO of ABS
counterparties. At the same time, S&P also withdrew the ratings at ACA Financial
Guaranty's request.

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Ambac Financial Group, Inc.
("Ambac"), headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated in
the state of Delaware on April 29, 1991. Ambac's activities are divided into two
business segments: (i) financial guarantee and (ii) financial services. Ambac
provides financial guarantee insurance for public and structured finance
obligations through its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance. As a
holding company, Ambac is largely dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance to
pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to pay its operating
expenses.


On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial
strength rating to AA from AAA, with negative implications. On June 19, 2008,
Moody's downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength rating from
Aaa to Aa3, with a negative outlook. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of Ambac
Assurance's insurance financial strength rating reflects Ambac Assurance's
overall credit profile in the current environment, including its significantly
constrained new business prospects, its impaired financial flexibility and
increased expected and stress loss projections among its mortgage-related risk
exposures relative to previous estimates. On November 5, 2008, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Aa3
to Baa1, with a developing outlook, as a result of greater than expected
mortgage-related losses in the third quarter. On November 19, 2008, S&P lowered
its insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance to A from AA, with a
negative outlook. The November 19, 2008 rating action on Ambac Assurance
reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance's exposures in the U.S. residential
mortgage sector and particularly the related collateralized debt obligation
structures have been a source of significant and comparatively
greater-than-competitor losses and will continue to expose the company to the
potential for further adverse loss development. On April 13, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Baa1
to Ba3, with a developing outlook, reflecting Ambac Assurance's weakened
business position and very constrained financial flexibility, as well as its
weakened risk adjusted capitalization, as Moody's loss estimates on residential
mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") have increased significantly. In Moody's
view, these higher loss estimates increase the estimated capital required to
support Ambac Assurance's sizable direct RMBS portfolio (including securities
owned as well as securities guaranteed) and also the insurer's large portfolio
of ABS CDO risks. On June 24, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to BBB
from A with negative implications. The June 24, 2009 rating action on Ambac
Assurance reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance is effectively in runoff and
the likelihood of the company continuing as an operating entity capable of
writing new business has decreased significantly. On July 28, 2009, S&P lowered
the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings
of Ambac Assurance to CC from BBB, with a developing outlook. The July 28, 2009
rating action on Ambac Assurance reflects S&P's view of the significant
deterioration in the Ambac Assurance's insured portfolio of nonprime RMBS and
related CDOs, which has required the company to strengthen reserves to account
for higher projected claims. In S&P's view, the additional reserves will have a
significant negative effect on operating results, which will likely cause
surplus to decline to below regulator required minimums. On July 29, 2009,
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance
from Ba3 to Caa2, with a developing outlook, reflecting Moody's belief that, as
a result of Ambac Assurance's recently announced large loss reserve increase and
credit impairment charge estimated for the second quarter of 2009 which would
reduce Ambac Assurance's regulatory capital to levels below the required minimum
threshold, there will be increased pressure on Ambac Assurance's counterparties
to commute outstanding exposures on terms that could imply a distressed
exchange. On March 25, 2010, S&P revised the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to R from CC (an
issuer rated "R" by S&P is under regulatory supervision because of its financial
condition). S&P's March 25, 2010 rating action resulted following a directive by
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac Assurance to
establish a segregated account for certain insured exposure, primarily policies
related to credit derivatives, RMBS, and other structured finance transactions.
On March 26, 2010, Moody's placed the Caa2 insurance financial strength rating
of Ambac Assurance on review for possible upgrade. On November 23, 2010, Moody's
affirmed Ambac's Caa2 insurance financial strength rating, with a developing
outlook. On November 30, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac at the company's request.
The November 30, 2010 rating action followed a directive by the Commissioner of
Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac to establish a segregated account
for certain insured exposure, primarily policies related to credit derivatives,
residential mortgage-backed securities, and other structured finance
transactions. On April 7, 2011, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial
strength rating of Ambac Assurance.


There have been a number of developments with respect to ratings actions by
the rating agencies. As a result of these rating agency actions, as well as
investor concern with respect to these actions, Ambac Assurance and its
operating subsidiaries have been able to originate only a de minimis amount of
new financial guarantee business since November 2007, and no new business in
2009. As a result, Ambac is no longer competing for new business.


On March 25, 2010, Ambac announced that, at the direction of the Office of
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin ("OCI"), Ambac Assurance
had established a segregated account for certain of its liabilities, primarily
policies related to credit derivatives, RMBS and other structured finance
transactions. This action derives from the OCI's view that immediate action is
necessary to address Ambac Assurance's financial position. In conjunction with
the establishment of the segregated account, the OCI has commenced
rehabilitation proceedings with respect to liabilities contained in the
segregated account in order to facilitate an orderly run-off and/or settlement
of those specific liabilities. On June 7, 2010 Ambac announced that it had
commuted all of its remaining CDOs of ABS and that certain other non-CDO of ABS
exposures would be commuted within the next twelve months.


On November 8, 2010, Ambac announced that it has filed for a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Ambac will continue to operate in
the ordinary course of business as "debtor-in-possession" under the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Ambac Assurance is
subject to insurance regulatory requirements of the States of Wisconsin and New
York, and the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed to conduct business.


Ambac Assurance's statutory policyholder surplus and qualified statutory
capital were $100.0 million and $628.3 million at September 30, 2012,
respectively as compared to $495.3 million and $684.6 million as of December 31,
2011, respectively. As of September 30, 2012, total stockholders' deficit was
$3.49 billion; at December 31, 2011, total stockholders' deficit was $3.15
billion. This increased deficit was primarily caused by the net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2012, partially offset by unrealized gains on
investment securities during the period.

Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance Inc.
("FSA")). Assured Guaranty, a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"),
is organized in the State of Maryland and provides financial guaranty insurance
to both the municipal and structured finance sectors. Assured Municipal, also a
subsidiary of Assured, is a separately capitalized company organized in the
State of New York and provides municipal bond insurance.


In January 2009, Assured Guaranty finalized an agreement with CIFG Assurance
North America, Inc. to assume a diversified portfolio of financial guaranty
contracts totaling approximately $13.3 billion of net par outstanding. Assured
Guaranty received $75.6 million, which included $85.7 million of upfront
premiums net of ceding commissions and approximately $12.2 million of future
installments related to this transaction.


On July 1, 2009, Assured completed the purchase of Financial Security
Assurance Holdings Ltd., the parent of financial guaranty insurance company,
FSA, from Dexia Holdings Inc. Effective November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed
Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. In certain states, Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. may operate under its prior name, Financial Security Assurance Inc.


On June 24, 2010, S&P published a Full Analysis in which it affirmed its
"AAA" financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal,
reflecting S&P's view of the companies' dominant market position in the bond
insurance industry and their strong combined capital position. On October 25,
2010, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA+ from AAA, with a stable outlook.
The downgrades reflect S&P's view of a struggling financial guarantee market,
each company's weak statutory operating performance, and also the quality of
each company's capital within S&P's capital adequacy analysis. On November 30,
2011 S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA- from AA+, with a stable outlook.
The November 30, 2011 downgrades reflect S&P's view that Assured Guaranty and
Assured Municipal do not maintain enough capital to mitigate the largest obligor
concentrations for a higher rating.


On November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of Assured Guaranty from Aaa to Aa2, primarily reflecting Moody's updated
view on Assured Guaranty's exposure to weakness inherent in the financial
guaranty business model. Also on November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of FSA from Aaa to Aa3, reflecting Moody's
view of FSA's diminished business and financial profile resulting from its
exposure to losses on U.S. mortgage risks and disruption in the financial
guaranty business more broadly. On November 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of Assured Guaranty from Aa2 to Aa3, with a
negative outlook. Moody's November 12, 2009 downgrade results from Moody's
review of the performance of Assured's RMBS exposures. Moody's said that adverse
trends in RMBS loss estimates have had varying effects on Assured's main
insurance subsidiaries. On March 5, 2010, Moody's confirmed the insurance
financial strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal at
Aa3, with a negative outlook. On January 17, 2013, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty to A3 from Aa3 and of
Assured Municipal to A2 from Aa3, both with a stable outlook. The January 17,
2013 downgrade reflects Moody's reassessment of the business franchise, expected
future profitability and financial flexibility of Assured Guaranty and Assured
Municipal.


Assured's third quarter 2012 net income declined to $142 million from $761
million in third quarter 2011 due primarily to the effects of changes in credit
spreads on the fair value of credit derivatives, offset in part by a decline in
loss expense, which was significantly higher in the prior year due mainly to the
effects of declining discount rates in the third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP
operating income in third quarter 2012 was $166 million, an increase from
operating income in third quarter 2011, due primarily to higher net earned
premiums due to refundings, accelerations and terminations, lower loss expense,
and a lower effective tax rate on operating income. As of September 30, 2012,
Assured Guaranty had total assets of $5.28 billion and total liabilities of
$4.13 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of $1.15 billion. As of
September 30, 2012, Assured Municipal had total assets of $10.74 billion and
total liabilities of $7.64 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of
$3.10 billion.

Municipal and their parent company, Assured, is based upon publicly available

Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp ("BHAC"). BHAC is a bond insurance company
created by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. ("Berkshire") in December 2007 and is
licensed to write financial guarantee insurance in 49 states.


On April 11, 2008, S&P assigned an initial rating of AAA to BHAC's insurance
financial strength, with a stable outlook. On April 25, 2008, Moody's assigned
an initial rating of Aaa to BHAC's insurance financial strength, with a stable
outlook. On April 8, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of BHAC from Aaa to Aa1, with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects
Moody's view concerning "the impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe
decline in equity markets over the past year as well as the protracted economic
recession." Moody's noted that Berkshire is also exposed to heightened
volatility in its earnings and capital base related to market value fluctuations
within its large portfolio of equity derivatives. On February 4, 2010, S&P
lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+, with a stable
outlook. The February 4, 2010 rating action was taken in anticipation of
Berkshire's acquisition of Northern Santa Fe Corporation reflecting S&P's
expectation that a significant part of the internal cash for the acquisition
will come from Berkshire's core insurance operations and that Berkshire's
overall capital adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA
rating and is not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near
term.


As of September 30, 2012, Berkshire had total assets of $424.1 billion and
total liabilities of $235.0 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of
$189.1 billion.

Build America Mutual Assurance Company ("BAM"). BAM is a New York domiciled
mutual insurance company owned by the issuers of municipal bonds who use BAM to
insure their debt obligations. BAM officially launched on July 23, 2012 and
began writing policies in September of 2012.


On July 23, 2012, S&P assigned an initial rating of AA to BAM's financial
strength and counterparty credit ratings, with a stable outlook. These ratings
based upon S&P's view that BAM holds a very strong competitive position with low
industry risk, along with extremely strong capital adequacy and strong operating
performance.


As of September 30, 2012 BAM had total net admitted assets of $518.9 million
and total liabilities of $27.9 million, resulting in a surplus as regards
policyholders of $491.0 million.


The information relating to BAM contained above has been furnished by BAM or

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). CIFG Holding, Inc. is the
holding company for the CIFG group of financial guaranty insurance and
reinsurance companies ("CIFG Group"), including CIFG Assurance North America,
Inc., a New York corporation and its subsidiaries. The CIFG Group is actively
managing the runoff of a portfolio of insured structured finance, municipal and
infrastructure risks. On September 29, 2010, CIFG and CIFG Guaranty entered into
a merger agreement which resulted in CIFG Guaranty merging into CIFG (together
with related transactions, the "CIFG Merger").


On March 6, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Aaa to A1, with a stable outlook. This rating action reflected
Moody's assessment of CIFG's weakened capitalization, impaired business
opportunities, and uncertain strategic direction, as a result, in part, of its
exposures to the U.S. residential mortgage market. Moody's believed that CIFG's
significant exposure to the mortgage sector, especially ABS CDOs is indicative
of a risk posture far greater than would be consistent with a Aaa rating going
forward. On May 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
ratings of CIFG to Ba2 from A1, with direction uncertain, reflecting the high
likelihood that, absent material developments, the company would fail minimum
regulatory capital requirements in New York and Bermuda due to expected
significant increases in modeled loss reserves on ABS CDOs. In Moody's view, the
breach of such regulatory capital requirements would put the company in a
precarious position, especially in light of the solvency provisions embedded in
its CDS exposures. On October 28, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of CIFG from Ba2 to B3, with direction uncertain,
reflecting Moody's expectation of substantially higher mortgage-related losses
arising from CIFG's insured portfolio, as well as the possibility that certain
troubled exposures could be commuted. On January 22, 2009, Moody's upgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of CIFG from B3 to Ba3, with a developing
outlook, reflecting the strengthened capital adequacy profile of CIFG following
its restructuring and the commutation of substantially all of its ABS CDO risks.
Also on January 22, 2009, S&P raised the insurance financial strength rating of
CIFG to BB from B, with a developing outlook. S&P's January 22, 2009 upgrade
results from the completion of CIFG's restructuring plan involving key
policyholders, creditors, and equity owners (counterparties) who had hedged
their ABS CDO and commercial real estate CDO exposures with CIFG and which were
significantly affected by defaults and downgrades of the underlying collateral.
On June 15, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of CIFG to CC from BB, with a negative outlook,
reflecting S&P's view of the significant deterioration in the company's insured
portfolio of nonprime RMBS which has necessitated that CIFG strengthen reserves
to account for the higher projected claims. On August 20, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of CIFG from Ba3to Caa2,
resulting from significant deterioration in the company's remaining insured
portfolio since January, 2009 when CIFG initiated a broad restructuring. On
November 11, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Caa2 to Ca. Also on November 11, 2009, Moody's announced that it
will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of CIFG. The November 11,
2009 rating actions reflect Moody's view that material deterioration in CIFG's
insured portfolio adversely affected the guarantor's capital adequacy profile
and Moody's believes that CIFG may no longer have sufficient financial resources
to pay all insurance claims. On February 16, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty
credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of CIFG.


As of September 30, 2012, CIFG had net admitted assets of $742.3 million and
total liabilities of $385.5 million. CIFG's statutory surplus as of September
30, 2012 is approximately $356.7 million, a decrease of approximately $227.8
million from approximately $584.5 million at December 31, 2011. This decrease is
primarily attributable to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves
established for student loans of approximately $252.3 million, which is
partially offset by other income statement balances resulting in a net loss of
approximately $227.0 million and an increase in contingency reserves of
approximately $3.5 million.


The information relating to CIFG and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by CIFG or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as to
the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.


Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). FGIC is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation. The company was engaged in the business of
providing financial guaranty insurance and other forms of credit enhancement for
public finance and structured finance obligations. In January 2008, FGIC
voluntarily ceased writing financial guaranty policies concerning new or
additional risks.


The deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the global
credit markets, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2007 and continued
through the fourth quarter of 2009, has adversely affected the company's
business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, the
company incurred significant losses related to its exposure to certain ABS CDOs,
which are backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and to certain RMBS, primarily
backed by first-lien or second-lien mortgages. These losses have resulted in a
substantial reduction of FGIC's statutory policyholders' surplus over time. On
November 24, 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, the predecessor to
the New York State Department of Financial Services, issued an order pursuant to

Section 1310 of the New York Insurance Law requiring FGIC to, among other
things, suspend paying any and all claims. FGIC was subsequently unable to
eliminate the impairment of its policyholders' surplus through an out-of-court
Surplus Restoration Plan. On June 11, 2012, Benjamin M. Lawsky, Superintendent
of Financial Services of the State of New York (the "Superintendent") filed a
verified petition with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for an order
of rehabilitation (i) appointing the Superintendent as rehabilitator
("Rehabilitator") of FGIC, (ii) directing the Rehabilitator to take possession
of the property and assets of FGIC and to conduct the business thereof, and

(iii) directing the Rehabilitator to take steps towards the removal of the
causes and conditions which have made FGIC's rehabilitation proceeding (the
"Rehabilitation Proceeding") necessary. FGIC consented to the commencement of
the Rehabilitation Proceeding.


Prior to the fourth quarter of 2007, FGIC's financial strength was rated
"Aaa" by Moody's "AAA" by S&P, and "AAA" by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch").
Moody's, S&P and Fitch have since completed several assessments of FGIC's
capital adequacy in relation to the company's exposure to ABS CDOs which are
backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and its exposure to first-lien and
second-lien RMBS. As a result of these assessments, Moody's, S&P and Fitch
downgraded the financial strength ratings of FGIC. As of March 31, 2008, Fitch
had downgraded FGIC from AA to BBB with Rating Watch Negative; Moody's had
downgraded FGIC from A3 to Baa3; and S&P had downgraded FGIC from A to BB. On
June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
FGIC from Baa3 to B1, reflecting FGIC's severely impaired financial flexibility
and proximity to minimum regulatory capital requirements relative to Moody's
estimates of expected case losses. On November 24, 2008, S&P lowered its
insurance financial strength rating of FGIC to CCC from BB, with a negative
outlook. S&P's November 24, 2008 downgrade results from FGIC's exposure to
nonprime and second-lien mortgages and related CDO of ABS. On December 19, 2008,
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC from B1 to
Caa1, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of higher
mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio and the
constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of the holding company. On March
24, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC
from Caa1 to Caa3, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of
higher mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio,
insufficient claims paying resources to cover Moody's estimate of expected loss,
and the constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of FGIC's holding
company. Also on March 24, 2009, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial
strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of FGIC to CC from CCC,
with a negative outlook. Also on April 22, 2009, S&P withdrew the ratings on
FGIC and the counterparty credit rating on the holding company, FGIC
Corporation, because of S&P's expectation that timely and comprehensive
financial information will no longer be available.


As of September 30, 2012, FGIC had net admitted assets of approximately $2.1
billion and total liabilities of approximately $5.8 billion.


On August 4, 2010, FGIC Corporation announced that it had filed a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the
Southern District of New York. None of FGIC Corporation's subsidiaries or
affiliates, including FGIC, are part of the Chapter 11 filing.

bonds. MAC currently guarantees only public finance transactions. MAC is an
Assured Guaranty company owned jointly by its affiliates Assured Guaranty
Municipal Corp. and Assured Guaranty Corp. MAC is part of the Assured Guaranty
Group.


On July 17, 2013, S&P assigned MAC a long-term financial strength and
counterparty credit rating of AA- to MAC with a stable outlook. On March 18,
2014, S&P raised its financial strength and enhancement rating on MAC from AA-
to AA. The rating action reflects S&P's view that MAC's competitive position
remains strong relative to its peers' in the bond industry. S&P continues to
view MAC as having a stable outlook.


As of June 30, 2014, MAC had a total net admitted assets of $1,519,869,768
and total liabilities of $999,277,625 resulting in a surplus as regards

(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). MBIA, Inc., a
Connecticut corporation, conducts its financial guarantee business through
though its wholly-owned subsidiaries MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA Corp."),
which writes global structured finance and non-U.S. public finance financial
guarantee insurance, and National Guarantee, which writes U.S. public finance
guarantees.


On February 18, 2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA Corp., announced
the restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance operations following the
approval of the New York and Illinois insurance regulators. The restructuring
involved the segregation of its financial guaranty insurance operations into two
separately capitalized sister companies, with National Guarantee assuming the
risk associated with its U.S. municipal exposures, and with MBIA Corp. insuring
the remainder of the portfolio, including all international and structured
finance exposures. Business ceded to MBIA Corp. from FGIC in 2008 has been
assigned to National Guarantee. To provide additional protection for its
municipal bond policyholders, National Guarantee has also issued second-to-pay
policies for the benefit of the policyholders covered by the reinsurance and
assignment. The second-to-pay policies, which are a direct obligation of
National Guarantee, will be held by The Bank of New York Mellon as insurance
trustee. These policies provide that if MBIA Corp. or FGIC, as applicable, do
not pay valid claims of their policyholders, the policyholders will then be able
to make a claim directly against National Guarantee under the second-to-pay
policies. On March 19, 2009, MBIA Illinois formally changed its name to National
Public Finance Guarantee Corporation. Effective December 1, 2009, National
Guarantee was redomesticated to the State of New York and is subject to
insurance regulations and supervision of the State of New York. National
Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA, Inc. and independently
capitalized with $5.6 billion in claims-paying resources as of December 31,
2010. In certain states, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation may
operate under its prior name, MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois.


On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded MBIA Corp.'s insurance financial strength
rating to AA from AAA. On June 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from Aaa
to A2. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its insurance
affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s limited financial flexibility and impaired
franchise, as well as the substantial risk within its portfolio of insured
exposures and a movement toward more aggressive capital management within the
group. On November 7, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from A2 to Baa1, with a
developing outlook. Moody's November 7, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its
insurance affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s diminished business and financial
profile resulting from its exposure to losses from U.S. mortgage risks and
disruption in the financial guaranty business more broadly. On February 18,
2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp.
from Baa1 to B3, with a developing outlook, reflecting MBIA Corp.'s substantial
reduction in claims-paying resources relative to the remaining higher-risk
exposures in its insured portfolio, given the removal of capital, and the
transfer of unearned premium reserves associated with the ceding of its
municipal portfolio to MBIA Illinois, as well as the continued deterioration of
MBIA Corp.'s insured portfolio of largely structured credits, with stress
reaching sectors beyond residential mortgage-related securities. Also on
February 18, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB+ from AA, with a negative
outlook. The February 18, 2009 rating action on MBIA Corp. reflects S&P's view
that MBIA Corp.'s retained insured portfolio lacks sufficient sector diversity
and with time could become more concentrated, and that MBIA Corp.'s 2005-2007
vintage direct RMBS, CDO of ABS, and other structured exposures are subject to
continued adverse loss development that could erode capital adequacy. At the
same time, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of
MBIA Illinois to AA- from AA, reflecting MBIA Illinois's uncertain business
prospects and capital. On June 5, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB from
BBB+, with a negative outlook, resulting from MBIA Corp.'s increased loss
assumptions on its 2005-2007 vintage direct RMBS and CDO of ABS and a change in
the assumed tax benefit of tax-loss carryforwards. Also on June 5, 2009, S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to A from AA-, with a negative outlook, reflecting
S&P's view of National Guarantee's uncertain business and capital-raising
prospects. On September 28, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BB+ from BBB, with
a negative outlook, reflecting S&P's view that macroeconomic conditions continue
to contribute to losses on the group's structured finance products. On December
22, 2010 S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial
enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to B from BB+, with a negative outlook,
reflecting increased stress case loss projections. Also on December 22, 2010 S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to BBB from A, with a developing outlook. On
December 19, 2011 Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
National Guarantee from Baa1 to Baa2, with a negative outlook, based upon
weakening of the overall MBIA group's market standing as losses grow at National
Guarantee's affiliated companies and the risk that resources at National
Guarantee could be drawn away to support losses elsewhere within the group. On
May 10, 2013 S&P raised the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of National Guarantee to A from BB, with a stable
outlook. The May 10, 2013 rating action reflects S&P's view that MBIA Corp. no
longer acts as an anchor on the National Guarantee rating following the
settlement with Societe Generale that ends litigation challenging National
Guarantee's split from MBIA Corp. in 2009. On May 21, 2013 Moody's upgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp. to B3 from Caa2, with a
positive outlook, citing MBIA Corp.'s improved capital and liquidity profile
following settlements of putback receivables and insured claims with major
counterparties. Also on May 21, 2013 Moody's upgraded the insurance financial
strength rating of National Guarantee to Baa1 from Baa2, with a positive
outlook. The May 21, 2013 rating action reflects National Guarantee's improved
credit profile following the repayment of the loan from its weaker affiliate,
MBIA Corp., and the termination of the litigation related to the 2009
restructuring.


As of September 30, 2012, National Guarantee had total net admitted assets of
$5.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion, resulting in a surplus as
regard policyholders of $1.8 billion.


As of September 30, 2012, MBIA, Inc. and its subsidiaries had total assets of
$22.1 billion and total liabilities of $19.6 billion. MBIA, Inc.'s total
shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2012 was $2.6 billion, increasing from
$1.7 billion as of December 31, 2011.


The information relating to MBIA and its affiliates contained above has been

Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian"). Radian Group Inc. ("Radian Group"),
headquartered in Philadelphia, provides private mortgage insurance and related
risk mitigation products and services to mortgage lenders nationwide through its
principal operating subsidiary, Radian Guaranty Inc. ("Radian Guaranty").
Radian, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Radian Guaranty, is domiciled and licensed
in New York as a financial guaranty insurer. In the third quarter of 2008,
Radian discontinued writing any new financial guaranty business, including
accepting reinsurance.


On March 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating
of Radian, as well as the ratings of its operational affiliates, from A3 to Ba1,
with a stable outlook, reflecting the substantial deterioration in the credit
profile of Radian Guaranty, coupled with increased loss estimates on Radian's
pooled corporate exposures. On November 24, 2009, S&P lowered the financial
strength, financial enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of Radian to BB
from BBB- and left the ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications,
reflecting S&P's view that adverse loss development in Radian's insured
portfolio has resulted in higher capital charges and could result in further
losses. On December 22, 2009, S&P lowered the financial strength, financial
enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of Radian to BB- from BB, with a
negative outlook.


As of September 30, 2012, Radian Group had total assets of $6.45 billion and
total liabilities of $5.43 billion. As of September 30, 2012, Radian had a
statutory policyholders' surplus of $1.02 billion and a contingency reserve of
$290.9 million.


The information relating to Radian and its affiliates contained above has
been furnished by Radian or the rating agencies. No representation is made
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date
hereof.


Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). Syncora Guarantee, a wholly owned subsidiary of Syncora Holdings
Ltd. ("Syncora Holdings"), is a New York domiciled financial guarantee insurance
company which provides credit enhancement and protection products to the public
finance and structured finance markets throughout the United States and
internationally.


In February 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of XLCA to A3 from Aaa. On June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of XLCA from A3 to B2, reflecting XLCA's severely
impaired financial flexibility and proximity to minimum regulatory capital
requirements relative to Moody's estimates of expected case losses. On October
24, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Syncora
Guarantee from B2 to Caa1. On November 18, 2008, S&P lowered its insurance
financial strength rating of Syncora Guarantee to B from BBB- with developing
expectations. S&P's November 18, 2008 downgrade resulted from the Syncora
Guarantee's delay in implementing its restructuring plan and slow progress in
its negotiations with counterparties of its CDO of ABS exposure. On January 29,
2009, S&P lowered the issuer credit and financial strength ratings of Syncora
Guarantee to CC from B, with a negative outlook. S&P's January 29, 2009
downgrade resulted from S&P's recent update to its distressed exchange criteria.
On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing outlook, as a result of the
large loss reserve and credit impairment charges taken by Syncora Guarantee on
its mortgage-related exposures during the fourth quarter, which have resulted in
a $2.4 billion statutory deficit at Syncora Guarantee as of December 31, 2008.
On April 27, 2009, S&P revised the financial strength and financial enhancement
ratings of Syncora Guarantee to R from CC (an issuer rated "R" by S&P is under
regulatory supervision because of its financial condition). Also on April 27,
2009, S&P revised the counterparty credit rating of Syncora Guarantee to D from
CC (an issuer rated "D" by S&P has failed to pay one or more of its financial
obligation when it became due). S&P's April 27, 2009 rating actions resulted
from Syncora Guarantee's announcement that pursuant to an order of the New York
Insurance Department ("NYID"), the company must suspend any and all claims
payments until it has restored its policyholders' surplus to a level greater
than or equal to $65 million, the minimum the state requires. On July 28, 2010,
S&P withdrew the D counterparty credit rating and the R financial strength and
financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee. S&P's July 28, 2010 ratings
actions resulted from S&P's belief that there is not sufficient information to
judge Syncora Guarantee's claims paying ability.


As of September 30, 2012, Syncora Guarantee had total assets of $1.17 billion
and total liabilities of $639 million, resulting in a policyholders' surplus of
$504.2 million.


On July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced that Syncora Guarantee has
completed its remediation plan sufficient to meet its minimum statutory
policyholder surplus requirements and address previously announced short and
medium term liquidity issues. Also on July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced
that the NYID had approved Syncora Guarantee's plan for the payment of accrued
and unpaid claims and for the payment of new claims as they become due in the
ordinary course of business, resulting in the recommencement of claim payments
by Syncora Guaranty on regularly scheduled payment dates occurring on or after
July 21, 2010.

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.


In order to be in an Insured Trust, bonds must be insured by one of the
Preinsured Bond Insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by
such Trust, if any. In determining eligibility for insurance, the Preinsured
Bond Insurers and the Portfolio Insurers have applied their own standards which
correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the
insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the
criteria used in the selection of bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the
standards of the Preinsured Bond Insurers and the Portfolio Insurers are more
restrictive than those of the Sponsor, the previously stated Trust investment
criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds. This decision is made
prior to the Date of Deposit, as debt obligations not eligible for insurance
are not deposited in an Insured Trust. Thus, all of the bonds in the portfolios
of the Insured Trusts are insured either by the respective Trust or by the
issuer of the bonds, by a prior owner of such bonds or by the Sponsor prior to
the deposit of such bonds in a Trust.


An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is to
obtain a higher yield on the portfolio of such Trust than would be available if
all the bonds in such portfolio had S&P "AAA" rating and yet at the same time
to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, on the bonds. There is, of course, no certainty that this
result will be achieved. Preinsured Bonds in an Insured Trust (all of which are
rated "AAA" by S&P) may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds
rated "AAA" by S&P. In selecting such bonds for an Insured Trust, the Sponsor
has applied the criteria hereinbefore described.


In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of
a bond, a Portfolio Insurer shall make such payment after the respective
insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened
(but not earlier than the date such payment is due). The insurer, as regards
any payment it may make, will succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect
thereof. All policies issued by the Portfolio Insurers, if any, and the
Preinsured Bond Insurers are substantially identical insofar as obligations to
an Insured Trust are concerned.


The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect
that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal
obligations paid to holders of insured bonds, under policy provisions
substantially identical to the policies described herein, will be excludable
from federal gross income under Section 103(a)(1) of the Code to the same extent
as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal obligations.
Holders of Units in an Insured Trust should discuss with their tax advisers the
degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling. However, counsel
for the Sponsor at the time of the closing of the Insured Trust, had given an
opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be excludable from federal
gross income to the extent described under "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus


Part II.


Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such
regulation, however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able
to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made
thereunder at some time in the future. At the date hereof, it is reported that
no claims have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the
Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the ability of any such
company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio
insurance.


The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished by such
companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio Insurer
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.



Portfolio Administration



The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units
tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may
not be available, such of the bonds designated by the Evaluator as the Trustee
in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The Evaluator, in designating such
bonds, will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b)
market value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, the overall quality
of the bonds remaining in the Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. The
Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose of
bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.


The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution
for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the
Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take
any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the
issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of
the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted
therefor. Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement
Bonds" in Prospectus Part II regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds
for Failed Bonds, the acquisition by the Trust of any bonds other than the
bonds initially deposited is not permitted.


If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio
insurance, or otherwise, within 30 days, the Trustee is required to notify the
Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to
hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor
of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted bond and
not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.

The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Invesco
Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report
personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect
to your Trust.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.



Trustee Information



The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent
permitted by law.


The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such
records shall include the name and address of every Unitholder of the Trusts.
Such books and records shall be open to inspection by any Unitholder at all
reasonable times during the usual business hours. The Trustee shall make such
annual or other reports as may from time to time be required under any
applicable state or Federal statute, rule or regulation. The Trustee is
required to keep a certified copy or duplicate original of the Trust Agreement
on file in its office available for inspection at all reasonable times during
the usual business hours by any Unitholder, together with a current list of the
bonds held in the Trusts.


Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed
and has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the
retiring Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a
successor trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or
without cause. Notice of such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each
Unitholder by the Sponsor. Upon execution of a written acceptance of such
appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and
obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the successor. The
resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective only when the successor
trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court of competent
jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any corporation into which a Trustee
may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall be a party,
shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee must be a banking corporation
organized under the laws of the United States or any state and having at all
times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than
$5,000,000.



Termination of the Trust Agreement



A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
51% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding (or, with respect to Van Kampen
Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 119 and subsequent series, by consent of
Unitholders representing 75% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding, and
with respect to a GNMA Income Portfolio, by consent of Unitholders of 66 2/3% of
the Units then outstanding) or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust, as
shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% (40% in the case of a GNMA
Income Portfolio) of the original principal amount of bonds.


A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If the Trust is
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by
such purchaser.


The Trust Agreement provides that the Trust shall terminate upon the
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but in
no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth
anniversary of the Trust Agreement (twentieth anniversary for Intermediate Term
Trusts and Variable Rate Trusts). In the event of termination of the Trust,
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder of the
Trust at his address appearing on the registration books of the Trust maintained
by the Trustee. Within a reasonable time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate
any bonds then held in the Trust and shall deduct from the funds of the Trust
any accrued costs, expenses or indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement,
including estimated compensation of the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any
amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or
other governmental charges. The sale of bonds in the Trust upon termination may
result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not
required at such time. For this reason, among others, the amount realized by a
Unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal amount or par amount
of bonds represented by the Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall
then distribute to each Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and
Principal Accounts. With such distribution the Unitholders shall be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the
Trustee in its sole discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve
are no longer necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in
the same manner.



Description of Ratings



Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &
Poor's long-term debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This
opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of
guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to
purchase, sell or hold the debt obligation, inasmuch as they do not comment as
to market price or suitability for a particular investor.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based on current
information furnished by the obligor or obtained by Standard & Poor's from
other sources it considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an
audit in connection with any credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on
unaudited financial information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or
withdrawn as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or
based on other circumstances.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based, in varying degrees,
on the following considerations:


I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.


II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.


III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement under the
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


The credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are
typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has
both senior and subordinate obligations, secured and unsecured obligations or
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.


AAA--An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is extremely strong.


AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is very strong.


A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is still strong.


BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment
on the obligation.


Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major
rating categories. r--This symbol is attached to the ratings of instruments
with significant non-credit risks. It highlights risks to principal or
volatility of expected returns which are not addressed in the credit rating.


NR--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is
insufficient information on which to base a rating or that Standard & Poor's
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.


Moody's Investors Service. Municipal long-term rating scale. Moody's
municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of issuers and issues
in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate
Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these
issuers and issues. The default and loss content for Moody's municipal
long-term rating scale differs from Moody's general long-term rating scale.


Municipal ratings are based upon the analysis of five primary factors
relating to municipal finance: market position, financial position, debt
levels, governance, and covenants. Each of the factors is evaluated
individually and for its effect on the other factors in the context of the
municipality's ability to repay its debt.


Aaa--Issuers or issues rated Aaa demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Aa--Issuers or issues rated Aa demonstrate very strong creditworthiness
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


A--Issuers or issues rated A present above-average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Baa--Issuers or issues rated Baa represent average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," "Ca" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the
lower end of that generic rating category.


General long-term rating scale. Moody's long-term obligation ratings are
opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an
original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a
financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings reflect both
the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of
default.


Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with
minimal credit risk.


Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to
very low credit risk.


A--Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to
low credit risk.


Baa--Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are
considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative
characteristics.


Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," "Ca" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the
lower end of that generic rating category.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of Van   
Kampen Focus Portfolios, Series 390 (Central Equity Trust, Diversified Income   
Series 10):                                                                     
We have audited the accompanying statement of condition (including the    
analysis of net assets) and the related portfolio schedule of Central Equity    
Trust, Diversified Income Series 10 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios,   
Series 390) as of May 31, 2006 and the related statements of operations and     
changes in net assets for the period from June 4, 2003 (Initial Date of Deposit)
through May 31, 2004 and the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2006. These statements
are the responsibility of the Trustee and the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on such statements based on our audits.                      
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public    
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Trust is not        
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal       
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal 
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an  
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial     
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and          
significant estimates made by the Trustee and Sponsor, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation  
of securities owned at May 31, 2006 by correspondence with the Trustee. We      
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.             
   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Central Equity Trust,          
Diversified Income Series 10 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Series   
390) as of May 31, 2006 and the results of operations and changes in net assets 
for the period from June 4, 2003 (Initial Date of Deposit) through May 31, 2004 
and the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2006, in conformity with accounting        
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 Notes to Financial Statements
 May 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             
Security Valuation - Securities are valued as described in Prospectus Part
II.                                                                             

  Security Cost - The cost of the Securities is determined based on the actual
price paid by the Trust on the various dates of deposit.                        

  Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the process of   
being collected, (2) the Securities in the Trust based on the value as described
in Note 1 and (3) accumulated dividends thereon, less accrued expenses of the   
Trust, if any.                                                                  

Federal Income Taxes - Unitholders are considered to be the owner of a pro
rata portion of the related Trust and, accordingly, no provisions have been made
for Federal income taxes.                                                       

Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of    
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are       
reported on an identified cost basis.                                           

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO                                                              
Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized  
appreciation (depreciation) at May 31, 2006 is as follows:                      

Unrealized Appreciation       $    19,821,843                             
Unrealized Depreciation            (2,454,000)

NOTE 3- OTHER                                                                   
Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Underwriter    
intends to maintain a market for Units and to continuously offer to purchase    
Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the value of the     
Securities in the portfolio of the Trust valued as described in Note 1, plus    
accumulated dividends to the date of settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds 
demand, or for other business reasons, the Underwriter may discontinue purchases
of Units at such prices. In the event that a market is not maintained for the   
Units, a Unitholder desiring to dispose of his Units may be able to do so only  
by tendering such units to the Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.  

   Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on adding to the
underlying value of the Securities per Unit on the date of an investor's        
purchase, plus an amount equal to the maximum sales charge of 4.50% of the      
public offering price which is equivalent to 4.712% of the aggregate underlying 
value of the Securities. On each June 4, commencing June 4, 2004, the secondary 
market sales charge will decrease by .5 of 1% to a minimum sales charge of 2.3%.

Compensation of Sponsor and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.0025 per Unit, not to 
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to all  
applicable Trusts). The Sponsor receives and annual fee for performing

THE TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a
Trust Indenture and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the date of  
this prospectus (the "Initial Date of Deposit"), among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as
Sponsor, Van Kampen Asset Management, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York,  
as Trustee and, in certain cases, as Evaluator, or their predecessors. Effective
April 23, 2001 American Portfolio Evaluation Services, a division of Van Kampen 
Investment Advisory Corp., resigned as Evaluator and The Bank of New York was   
appointed successor Evaluator.                                                  

   The Trust offers the opportunity to purchase Units representing proportionate
interests in a portfolio of equity securities. The Trust may be an appropriate  
medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of common stocks  
with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.   

On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited delivery statements 
relating to contracts for the purchase of the Securities and an irrevocable     
letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the Trustee. In
exchange for these contracts the Trustee delivered to the Sponsor documentation 
evidencing the ownership of Units of the Trust. Unless otherwise terminated as  
provided in the Trust Agreement, the Trust will terminate on the Mandatory      
Termination Date and any remaining Securities will be liquidated or distributed 
by the Trustee within a reasonable time. As used in this prospectus the term    
"Securities" means the securities (including contracts to purchase these        
securities) listed in the "Portfolio" in Part One and any additional securities 
deposited into the Trust.                                                       

Additional Units may be issued at any time by depositing in the Trust (i) 
additional Securities, (ii) contracts to purchase Securities together with cash 
or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit or the    
equivalent) with instructions to purchase additional Securities. As additional  
Units are issued by the Trust, the aggregate value of the Securities will be    
increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit will be
decreased. The Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the Trust  
following the Initial Date of Deposit, provided that the additional deposits    
will be in amounts which will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the same      
percentage relationship among the number of shares of each Security in the      
Trust's portfolio as existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit.       
Investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in     
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the Securities
between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the Securities and because  
the Trust will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees.                

   Each Unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the Trust. To
the extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee or additional Units are   
issued as a result of additional Securities being deposited by the Sponsor, the 
fractional undivided interest in the Trust represented by each unredeemed Unit  
will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual interest in the Trust
will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender 
to the Trustee by Unitholders, which may include the Sponsor, or until the      
termination of the Trust Agreement.                                             

The Trust consists of (a) the Securities (including contracts for the     
purchase thereof) listed under the "Portfolio" in Part One as may continue to be
held from time to time in the Trust, (b) any additional Securities acquired and 
held by the Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and (c) any 
cash held in the related Income and Capital Accounts. Neither the Sponsor nor   
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the Securities.

OBJECTIVES AND SECURITIES SELECTION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of the Trust is to provide capital appreciation and dividend
income. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of 
stocks of companies which may include United States domestic electric utilities,
natural gas utilities, water utilities, telecommunications companies, real      
estate investment trusts, technology companies, health care companies, consumer 
products companies, consumer cyclicals companies, consumer staples companies,   
energy companies, industrials companies or financial services companies. The    
portfolio consists of securities selected by research analysts at Edward D.     
Jones & Co., L.P. (the "Underwriter") and approved by the Sponsor. In selecting 
the Securities, the following factors, among others, were considered: dividend  
yield, geographic diversification, earnings growth rates, regulatory climate and
stock valuation. At the time the Securities were selected, the Underwriter's    
research analysts were currently covering all the issuers of the Securities and 
had published favorable recommendations for each of them. There can be no       
assurance that such coverage will continue for any issuer during the life of the
Trust or that the report on any such issuer will continue to be favorable. A    
downgrade in an analyst's recommendation for an issuer, or the termination of   
such coverage, could negatively affect the performance of the Trust.            

You should note that the selection criteria were applied to the Securities
for inclusion in the Trust as of the Initial Date of Deposit. After this date,  
the Securities may no longer meet the selection criteria. Should a Security no  
longer meet the selection criteria, we will generally not remove the Security   
from the portfolio. In offering the Units to the public, neither the Sponsor nor
any broker-dealers are recommending any of the individual Securities but rather 
the entire pool of Securities, taken as a whole, which are represented by the   
Units.                                                                          

 Telecommunications. The emergence of a global, networked economy appears to
be changing the face of the telecommunications industry. Telecommunications     
companies provide local, long distance and wireless telephone, as well as cable 
television and internet, services and information systems, manufacture          
telecommunications products, and operate voice, data and telecommunications     
networks. As the technology driving this industry group continues to develop and
evolve, telecommunications companies could continue to grow in both customer    
base and services offered.                                                      

  Financial Services. The Trust may invest significantly in financial services
companies. Many banks, insurance companies and other financial services         
companies have recently made changes in the products they offer. The financial  
services industry has experienced a high level of consolidations, mergers and   
acquisitions as well as other regulatory issues. This industry group may be     
appealing for reasons such as deregulation of the banking industry and          
accelerated earnings growth. These factors can potentially provide advantages to
those investing in this industry group.                                         

Utilities. The environment of the electric, natural gas and water utility 
industry appears to be adapting to include recent changes in regulatory         
requirements as well as technological changes. In the past, this industry was   
fraught with government mandated monopolies. Today, many states are deregulating
their utilities which may result in lowering some of the barriers to            
competition. Additionally, utility companies appear to be expanding their       
services and offerings to include other retail services not traditionally       
offered. The growth and expansion occurring could potentially continue as the   
utility industry proceeds through these transformations.                        

  Real Estate Investment Trusts. A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a
company that buys, develops, finances and/or manages income-producing real      
estate such as apartments, shopping centers, offices and warehouses. A REIT can 
be a good way to invest in commercial real estate. Compared to traditional      
direct investments in real estate, which may be difficult to sell and value,    
REITs are traded on major stock exchanges making them highly liquid. REIT       
investors also gain the advantage of skilled management since REIT management   
teams tend to be experts within their specific property or geographic niches.   
Many believe that the attractive features of property ownership and stock       
ownership are combined in this investment vehicle. REITs can provide investors  
with current income, as they are currently required to distribute 90% of taxable
income annually, and can have the potential for attractive returns. They have   
historically had low relative volatility and may provide inflation protection.  

Consumer Staples. Consumer staples is a relatively mature industry, with  
growth in line with population growth. Recent waves of consolidation in the     
industry have reduced the number of competitors, which has enabled product price
increases in some sectors. Additionally, product innovation has proven key to   
growth and should lead to above-industry growth rates for successful companies. 
The industry is characterized primarily by stable, high-profit margin companies,
several of which pay attractive dividends.                                      

Industrials. The industrials industry includes capital goods, commercial  
services and transportation companies. Generally, growth prospects for the      
industry are tied to economic factors such as consumer and business spending,   
U.S. Gross Domestic Product and exports to foreign nations. The increasingly    
global economy should increase the demand for industrial products made by U.S.  
firms. Within capital goods, defense and electronics are some of the fastest    
growing areas, given the political support for higher government spending on    
defense initiatives. Many industrials companies are well-established and have   
demonstrated a track record of paying dividends and increasing the amount of    
dividends paid over time.                                                       

   Health Care. An aging population, new drug development and product innovation
should drive growth for this industry. Additionally, foreign demand for health  
care, particularly from developing nations, continues to increase. The industry 
has historically grown at a rate faster than the overall economy and that trend 
should continue. Research and development spending, supported by strong demand, 
should lead to new products. Health care companies have traditionally paid part 
of earnings as dividends, which is expected to continue. Given the growth       
prospects for the industry, dividend growth should be meaningful as well.       

  Energy. As the world economy grows, energy use is also expected to rise. The
companies that produce oil and natural gas are finding and developing new       
sources worldwide to satisfy this growing need. Oil companies also refine crude 
oil into useful products such as gasoline and jet fuel, as well as provide the  
raw materials for a wide variety of plastics. Investors benefit from the        
diversity of their businesses, their global reach, and their ability to find    
attractive opportunities in the changing energy marketplace.                    

Technology. The Trust may invest in technology companies. Technology      
companies generally include companies involved in the development, design,      
manufacture and sale of computers, computer related equipment, computer         
networks, communications systems, telecommunications products, electronic       
products, and other related products, systems and services. Technology is a     
cyclical industry, driven by corporate and consumer spending on technology      
products, services and software. New technologies have the potential to increase
productivity and enable new applications. Stable spending on traditional        
technology platforms such as personal computers, plus spending on new           
technologies, should enable the industry to grow faster than the economy.       
Several technology companies are generating substantial excess cash, which they 
have used to begin paying dividends. These companies have the potential to      
increase their dividends on a regular basis.                                    

Consumer Cyclicals. The Trust may invest in companies that manufacture or 
sell products or services, the demand for which is easily influenced by general 
economic conditions. Industries within this segment include advertising,        
airlines, auto parts, auto manufacturing, broadcasting, casinos, clothing and   
fabrics, consumer electronics, entertainment, footwear, furnishings and         
appliances, home construction, lodging, publishing, recreational products and   
services, restaurants, apparel retailers, broadline retailers, drug-based       
retailers, specialty retailers, tires and toys. These companies would be        
expected to perform well during an improving economy but may lag during a       
declining economy. Industries within this group that may hold potential for     
above-average growth include niche retailing, entertainment and media. Many     
companies within this sector are becoming more dividends-focused, and may       
increase their dividends going forward.                                         

Consumer Products. Consumer products is a relatively mature industry, with
growth in-line with population growth. Recent waves of consolidation in the     
industry have reduced the number of competitors, which has enabled product price
increases in some sectors. Additionally, product innovation has proven key to   
growth and should lead to above-industry growth rates for successful companies. 
The industry is characterized primarily by stable, high-profit margin companies,
several of which pay attractive dividends.                                      

  Underwriter Activities. The Underwriter may recommend or effect transactions
in the Securities in its day to day brokerage activities. This may have an      
adverse effect on the prices of the Securities. This also may have an impact on 
the price the Trust pays for the Securities and the price received upon Unit    
redemptions or Trust termination.                                               

The Underwriter, in its day to day activities, may act as a broker, agent,
principal or market maker in connection with the purchase and sale of equity    
securities, including the Securities. The Underwriter may also provide          
investment banking services to the issuers of, or issue reports and make        
recommendations on, the Securities. For any of these brokerage, market-making or
investment banking activities, the Underwriter may receive additional           
compensation. The Underwriter may also receive compensation based on commissions
generated by sales of Units in addition to its concession or agency commission.

RISK FACTORS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your Trust. You should understand these   
risks before you invest. If the value of the securities falls, the value of your
Units will also fall. We cannot guarantee that your Trust will achieve its      
objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.      

   Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your
Trust will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below    
your original purchase price. Market value fluctuates in response to various    
factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial  
condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a    
security of the issuer. Even though your Trust is supervised, you should        
remember that we do not manage your Trust. Your Trust will not sell a security  
solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.         

  Dividend Payment Risk. Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a
security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security. Stocks represent   
ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.      
Common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has
provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when     
declared by an issuer's board of directors, and the amount of any dividend may  
vary over time.                                                                 

Financial Services Companies. The Trust invests significantly in banks,   
insurance companies and other financial services companies. Banks and their     
holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic     
recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations in geographic      
markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and competition    
from new entrants in their fields of business. In addition, banks and their     
holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level 
and may be adversely affected by increased regulations.                         

  Banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as
regulatory changes, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services overhaul  
legislation, permit new entrants to offer various financial products.           
Technological advances such as the Internet allow these nontraditional lending  
sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data.     
Banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms 
and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services    
that were traditionally offered by banks.                                       

Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are   
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the 
volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction of 
the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health of customers, equity
transaction volume, the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of
emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the 
stock prices, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing            
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital    
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of     
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies      
involved in investment management and brokerage activities are also subject to  
extensive regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations,  
and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such     
laws, regulations and rules, could adversely affect the stock prices of such    
companies.                                                                      

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a       
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and   
pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other natural or man-made 
disasters and the effects of client mergers. Already extensively regulated,     
insurance companies' profits may be adversely affected by increased government  
regulation or tax law changes.                                                  

Utility Companies. Many utility companies, especially electric and gas and
other energy related utility companies, are subject to various uncertainties,   
including:                                                                      

o    risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;            

    o    restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;     

  o    regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;            

o    coping with the general effects of energy conservation;          

    o    technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;                                       

o    the effects of local weather, maturing markets and difficulty in 
 expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors;

o    the potential impact of natural or man-made disasters;           

 o    difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
       frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;

o    the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;

o    difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities; and                                      

o    increased competition.                                           

Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the 
supply of or demand for energy, such as electricity or natural gas, or water, or
the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely
affect the profitability of the issuers of the Securities and the performance of
the Trust.                                                                      

Utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and  
state levels in the United States. At the federal level, the Federal Energy     
Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"),   
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and the Nuclear Regulatory  
Commission (the "NRC") have authority to oversee electric and combination       
electric and gas utilities. The value of utility company stocks may decline     
because governmental regulation affecting the utilities industry can change.    
This regulation may prevent or delay the utility company from passing along cost
increases to its customers, which could hinder the utility company's ability to 
meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures, 
including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary     
bankruptcy proceedings, by its creditors against such utility company. In 2001, 
two California public utilities were threatened with such action by their       
wholesale suppliers, and one of these utilities filed a voluntary petition for  
relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of 1978. Furthermore,       
regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and other pressures,  
may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting or operational    
policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's profitability and its 
stock price. In late 2001, a trader and marketer of utilities, commodities and  
financial and risk management services filed a voluntary petition for relief    
under Chapter 11 as a result of being negatively impacted by several of these   
and other factors. Mergers in the utility industry may require approval from    
several federal and state regulatory agencies, including FERC, the FTC, and the 
SEC. These regulatory authorities could, as a matter of policy, reverse the     
trend toward deregulation and make consolidation more difficult, or cause delay 
in the merger process, any of which could cause the prices of these stocks to   
fall.                                                                           

   Real Estate Investment Trusts. Many factors can have an adverse impact on the
performance of a particular REIT, including its cash available for distribution,
the credit quality of a particular REIT or the real estate industry generally.  
The success of REITs depends on various factors, including occupancy and rent   
levels, appreciation of the underlying property and the ability to raise rents  
on those properties. Economic recession, overbuilding, tax law changes, higher  
interest rates or excessive speculation can all negatively impact REITs and     
their future earnings and share prices.                                         

Risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate include, among  
other factors,                                                                  

o    general U.S. and global as well as local economic conditions;    

o    decline in real estate values;                                   

o    the financial health of tenants;                                 

o    overbuilding and increased competition for tenants;              

o    oversupply of properties for sale;                               

o    changing demographics;                                           

 o    changes in interest rates, tax rates and other operating expenses;

o    changes in government regulations;                               

o    changes in zoning laws;                                          

   o    the ability of the owner to provide adequate management, maintenance
and insurance;                                              

 o    faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital improvements;

o    the cost of complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act;  

    o    regulatory and judicial requirements, including relating to liability
for environmental hazards;                                  

o    natural or man-made disasters;                                   

o    changes in the perception of prospective tenants of the safety,  
convenience and attractiveness of the properties;           

o    changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand; and             

o    the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at
rates acceptable to developers.                             

   Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms
of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and 
REITs in particular. Properties owned by a REIT may not be adequately insured   
against certain losses and may be subject to significant environmental          
liabilities, including remediation costs.                                       

   You should also be aware that REITs may not be diversified and are subject to
the risks of financing projects. The real estate industry may be cyclical, and, 
if the Trust acquires REIT Securities at or near the top of the cycle, there is 
increased risk of a decline in value of the REIT Securities and therefore the   
value of the Units. REITs are also subject to defaults by borrowers and the     
market's perception of the REIT industry generally.                             

   Because of their structure, and the legal requirement that they distribute at
least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually, REITs require       
frequent amounts of new funding, through both borrowing money and issuing stock.
Thus, REITs historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new      
equity shares (or equivalents) to purchase or build new properties. This may    
have adversely affected REIT equity share market prices. Both existing and new  
share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future,       
especially when REITs continue to issue stock when real estate prices are       
relatively high and stock prices are relatively low.                            

Consumer Staples. The Trust may invest significantly in companies that    
manufacture or sell various consumer staples. General risks of these companies  
include the general state of the economy, intense competition and consumer      
spending trends. A decline in the economy or other change which results in a    
reduction of consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits.
Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or reduced
market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials costs,  
an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product       
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

Industrials. The Trust may invest significantly in industrials companies. 
General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess 
capacity and consumer spending trends. Capital goods companies may also be      
significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic cycles,     
technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply of key   
materials, labor relations, government regulations, government contracts and    
e-commerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry 
have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led
to the overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the     
industry may face similar scrutiny.                                             

  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment 
manufacturers.                                                                  

Health Care Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in health care    
companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices 
and instruments, drugs and biotec hnology, managed care, hospital               
management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face           
substantial government regulation and approval procedures. Congress and the     
President have proposed, and in some cases approved, a variety of legislative   
changes concerning health care issuers from time to time, including, but not    
limited to, cost and prescription drug price controls and more rigorous approval
processes for new pharmaceuticals and devices. Additional government regulation,
or any change in existing regulation, can have a significantly unfavorable      
effect on the price and availability of products and services.                  

Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing      
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of   
patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a       
product will never come to market. The research and development costs of        
bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial. This process  
involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval. These         
companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years,
if at all. The failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a    
substantial negative impact on a company and its stock.                         

Energy Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in energy companies.   
Energy companies face risks related to political conditions in oil producing    
regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide supply of oil and natural   
gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the ability to find and   
acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable, operating       
hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer demand. Political      
conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in the past.        
Political instability or war in these regions could have a negative impact on   
your investment. Oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile. OPEC     
controls a substantial portion of world oil production. OPEC may take actions to
increase or suppress the price or availability of oil. Various domestic and     
foreign government authorities and international cartels also impact these      
prices. Any substantial decline in these prices could have an adverse effect on 
energy companies. Energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire  
additional energy reserves. The exploration and recovery process involves       
significant operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy company has no  
assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be         
economically recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government        
regulation, including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased
costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain   
companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged         
accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their       
financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar         
scrutiny.                                                                       

Technology Companies. Technology companies face risks related to rapidly  
changing technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns,      
evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. An          
unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a     
technology company. The failure of a technology company to introduce new        
products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology, can have
a negative impact on the company's results. Technology stocks tend to experience
substantial price volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new   
products, technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock
prices to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume   
fluctuations may occur in the Securities of companies in this industry group    
that are unrelated to the operating performance of the company.                 

 The market for certain products may have only recently begun to develop, is
rapidly evolving or is characterized by an increase in suppliers. Key components
of some technology products are available only from limited sources. This can   
impact the cost of and ability to acquire these components. Some technology     
companies service highly concentrated customer bases of only a limited number of
large companies. Any failure to meet the standards of these customers could     
result in a significant loss or reduction in sales. Many products and           
technologies are incorporated into other products. As a result, some companies  
are sometimes highly dependent on the performance of other technology companies.
We cannot guarantee that these customers will continue to place additional      
orders or will place orders in similar quantities as in the past.               

The life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short,  
resulting in volatile sales, earnings and stock prices for many technology      
companies. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technologies, competitive  
advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls.            
Historically, many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the       
consumer, as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or       
pricing power. Some of the large technology companies have been involved in     
antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future. A slowdown in        
corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company
revenues. Technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part
of their revenues. Any economic slowdown could hurt revenues.                   

   Consumer Cyclicals. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals sector
depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and is     
subject to severe competition. Therefore, the success of consumer cyclicals     
companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international  
economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. A slowdown in the 
economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry. The success of       
companies in the consumer cyclicals segment is also strongly affected by changes
in demographics and consumer tastes.                                            

Consumer Products. The Trust may invest significantly in companies that   
manufacture or sell various consumer products. General risks of these companies 
include the general state of the economy, intense competition and consumer      
spending trends. A decline in the economy which results in a reduction of       
consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits. Furthermore,
the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or reduced market      
acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials costs, an      
inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product liability
claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance and stock 
prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.                     

Telecommunications Companies. The Trust invests significantly in          
telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to substantial        
governmental regulation. For example, the United States government and state    
governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a 
company may offer. This industry has experienced substantial deregulation in    
recent years. Deregulation may lead to fierce competition for market share and  
can have a negative impact on certain companies. Recent federal legislation     
governing the United States telecommunications industry remains subject to      
judicial review and additional interpretation, which may adversely affect the   
companies whose securities are held by the Trust. Competitive pressures are     
intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid volatility. Certain  
telecommunications products may become outdated very rapidly. A company's       
performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological    
advances.                                                                       

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications      
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

Certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than  
larger, established issuers. Smaller companies may have limited product lines,  
markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade in lower volumes than
larger companies. As a result, the prices of these securities may fluctuate more
than the prices of other issuers.                                               

No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price which includes the
underlying value of the Securities, the sales charge, and cash, if any, in the  
Income and Capital Accounts. The maximum sales charge assessed to each          
Unitholder is set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in   
Part One. The secondary market sales charge will reduce annually by 0.5% to a   
minimum of 2.30% as set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information"
in Part One. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ 
slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the 
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.  

   Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and children under
21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the
benefit of such persons) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates, the       
Underwriter, and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public  
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession.                           

The minimum purchase is 200 Units but may vary by selling firm.           

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part One
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying Securities in   
the Trust. The initial price of the Securities was determined by the Trustee.   
The Trustee will generally determine the value of the Securities as of the      
Evaluation Time on each business day and will adjust the Public Offering Price  
of Units accordingly. The Evaluation Time is the close of the New York Stock    
Exchange on each business day. The term "business day", as used herein and under
"Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units", excludes Saturdays, Sundays and   
holidays observed by the New York Stock Exchange. The Public Offering Price per 
Unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on  
each business day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time  
and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the          
Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time        
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders      
received by the Sponsor after the Evaluation Time, and orders received by       
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or orders received 
by such persons that are not transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time    
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of the next determined  
Public Offering Price per Unit provided they are received timely by the Sponsor 
on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to 
transmit orders received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a   
timely manner.                                                                  

The value of portfolio securities is based on the securities' market price
when available. When a market price is not readily available, including         
circumstances under which the Trustee determines that a security's market price 
is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its fair value, as determined
under procedures established by the Trustee or an independent pricing service   
used by the Trustee. In these cases, the Trust's net asset value will reflect   
certain portfolio securities' fair value rather than their market price. With   
respect to securities that are primarily listed on foreign exchanges, the value 
of the portfolio securities may change on days when you will not be able to     
purchase or sell Units. The value of any foreign securities is based on the     
applicable currency exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time. The Sponsor will   
provide price dissemination and oversight services to the Trust.                

   Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by the Sponsor and
the Underwriter at the Public Offering Price.                                   

The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. The  
Underwriter will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with
the distribution of Units as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter
Compensation".                                                                  

 Except as provided in this section, any discount provided to investors will
be borne by the selling dealer or agent as indicated under "General" above.     
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no case shall the total of  
any concessions, agency commissions and any additional compensation allowed or  
paid to any broker, dealer or other distributor of Units with respect to any    
individual transaction exceed the total sales charge applicable to such         
transaction. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any 
order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or   
agency commission to dealers and others from time to time.                      

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional 
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the Trusts and our
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of  
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related         
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the Trust and our other products. Fees may      
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection  
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars 
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for  
your Units.                                                                     

Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will receive a gross sales
commission equal to the total sales charge applicable to each transaction. The  
Underwriter will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with
the distribution of Units equal to 65% of the sales charge applicable to the    
transaction. Any sales charge discount provided to investors will be borne by   
the selling dealer or agent. In addition, the Sponsor will realize a profit or  
loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the Securities by 
the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to the Trust on the Initial Date of  
Deposit as well as on subsequent deposits. The Sponsor has not participated as  
sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicate or  
as an agent in a private placement for any of the Securities. The Underwriter   
may benefit from, or receive compensation in connection with, activities        
described under "Objectives and Securities Selection". The Sponsor may realize  
profit or loss as a result of the possible fluctuations in the market value of  
the Securities, since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units are        
retained by the Underwriter. In maintaining a secondary market, the Underwriter 
will realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price
at which Units are purchased and the price at which Units are resold (which     
price includes the applicable sales charge) or from a redemption of repurchased 
Units at a price above or below the purchase price. Cash, if any, made available
to the Sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be 
used in the Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor,
subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.              

The Sponsor, the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may have   
participated in a public offering of one or more of the Securities. The Sponsor,
the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them or their employees may have a 
long or short position in these Securities or related securities. The Sponsor,  
the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may act as a specialist or    
market maker for these Securities. An officer, director or employee of the      
Sponsor, the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may be an officer or 
director for issuers of the Securities.                                         

Purchases and sales of Securities by the Trust may impact the value of the
Securities. This may especially be the case during the initial offering of      
Units, upon Trust termination and in the course of satisfying large Unit        
redemptions. Any publication of a list of Securities, or a list of anticipated  
Securities, to be included in the Trust may also cause increased buying activity
in certain Securities. Once this information becomes public, investors may      
purchase individual Securities appearing in such a publication and may do so    
during or prior to the initial offering of Units. It is possible that these     
investors could include investment advisory and brokerage firms of the Sponsor, 
the Underwriter or the affiliates of either of them or firms that are           
distributing Units. This activity may cause the Trust to purchase stocks at a   
higher price than those buyers who effect purchases prior to purchases by the   
Trust.                                                                          

  Market for Units. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Underwriter may
maintain a market for Units and purchase Units at the secondary market          
repurchase price, which is described under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units". The Underwriter may discontinue purchases of Units or discontinue       
purchases at this price at any time. In the event that a secondary market is not
maintained, a Unitholder will be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to  
the Trustee for redemption at the Redemption Price. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Redemption of Units". Unitholders should contact their broker to   
determine the best price for Units in the secondary market. The Trustee will    
notify the Underwriter of any Units tendered for redemption. If the             
Underwriter's bid in the secondary market equals or exceeds the Redemption Price
per Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which Units would 
have been redeemed by the Trustee. The Underwriter may sell repurchased Units at
the secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit.                            

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Units are available for purchase in connection with certain types of      
tax-sheltered retirement plans, including Individual Retirement Accounts for    
individuals, Simplified Employee Pension Plans for employees, qualified plans   
for self-employed individuals, and qualified corporate pension and profit       
sharing plans for employees. The purchase of Units may be limited by the plans' 
provisions and does not itself establish such plans.                            

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions. Dividends and any net proceeds from the sale of Securities 
received by the Trust will generally be distributed to Unitholders on each      
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date. These  
dates appear under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One. A  
person becomes a Unitholder of record on the date of settlement (generally three
business days after Units are ordered). Unitholders may elect to receive        
distributions in cash or to have distributions reinvested into additional Units.

Dividends received by the Trust are credited to the Income Account of the 
Trust. Other receipts (e.g., capital gains, proceeds from the sale of           
Securities, etc.) are credited to the Capital Account. Proceeds received on the 
sale of any Securities, to the extent not used to meet redemptions of Units or  
to pay fees or expenses, will be distributed to Unitholders. Proceeds received  
from the disposition of any Securities after a Record Date and prior to the     
following Distribution Date will be held in the Capital Account and not         
distributed until the next Distribution Date. Any distribution to Unitholders   
consists of each Unitholder's pro rata share of the available cash in the Income
and Capital Accounts as of the related Record Date.                             

   Estimated Distributions. The estimated initial distribution and estimated net
annual distribution per Unit may be shown under "Summary of Essential Financial 
Information" in Prospectus Part One. The estimate of the income a Trust may     
receive is based on the most recent ordinary quarterly dividends declared by an 
issuer, the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign
issuers, or scheduled income payments (in all cases accounting for any          
applicable foreign withholding taxes). The actual net annual distributions are  
expected to decrease over time. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees 
and expenses during a Trust's life. Dividend and income conventions for certain 
companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in the      
United States and in certain instances, dividends/income paid or declared over  
several years or other periods may be used to estimate annual distributions. The
actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimated 
amount due to changes in a Trust's fees and expenses, in actual income received 
by a Trust, currency fluctuations and with changes in a Trust such as the       
acquisition, call, maturity or sale of Securities. Due to these and various     
other factors, actual income received by a Trust will most likely differ from   
the most recent dividends or scheduled income payments.                         

Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may have distributions automatically     
reinvested in additional Units under the Automatic Reinvestment Option (to the  
extent Units may be lawfully offered for sale in the state in which the         
Unitholder resides). To participate in this reinvestment option, a Unitholder   
must file with the Trustee a written notice of election, together with any      
certificate representing Units and other documentation that the Trustee may then
require, at least five days prior to the related Record Date. A Unitholder's    
election will apply to all Units owned by the Unitholder and will remain in     
effect until changed by the Unitholder. If Units are unavailable for            
reinvestment, distributions will be paid in cash.                               

  In addition, under the Guaranteed Reinvestment Option Unithholders may elect
to have distributions automatically reinvested in certain Van Kampen mutual     
funds (the "Reinvestment Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment         
objectives which differ from those of the Trust. The prospectus relating to each
Reinvestment Fund describes its investment policies and how to begin            
reinvestment. A Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds   
from the Sponsor. Purchases of shares of a Reinvestment Fund will be made at a  
net asset value computed on the Distribution Date. Unitholders with an existing 
Guaranteed Reinvestment Option account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on    
distribution reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new      
account which allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value.  

   A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing no later than  
five days before a Distribution Date. The Sponsor, each Reinvestment Fund, and  
its investment adviser shall have the right to suspend or terminate these       
reinvestment plans at any time.                                                 

Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee at Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay Street,    
20th Floor, New York, New York 10286. Certificates must be tendered to the      
Trustee, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with    
signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity in connection with 
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of applicable            
governmental charges, if any. No later than the seventh day following the       
tender, the Unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash an amount for each   
Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed on the date of tender.
The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received by the
Trustee, except that with respect to Units received by the Trustee after the    
Evaluation Time or on a day which is not a Trust business day, the date of      
tender is deemed to be the next business day. Redemption requests received by   
authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are        
properly transmitted to the Trustee by the time designated by the Trustee, are  
priced based on the date of receipt. Redemption requests received by the Trustee
after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by authorized       
financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption requests        
received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until after the
time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the next        
determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the Trustee on 
such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to    
transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee so they will be    
received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge 
an order handling fee for processing redemption requests. Units redeemed        
directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.                      

Unitholders tendering 2,500 or more Units (or $25,000) of the Trust for   
redemption may request an in-kind distribution of Securities equal to the       
Redemption Price per Unit on the date of tender. Unitholders may not request an 
in-kind distribution during the five business days preceding the Trust's        
termination. An in-kind distribution will be made by the Trustee through the    
distribution of each of the Securities in book-entry form to the account of the 
Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company. Amounts representing    
fractional shares will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the number
of shares of any Security included in a Unitholder's in-kind distribution to    
facilitate the distribution of whole shares.                                    

The Trustee may sell Securities to satisfy Unit redemptions. To the extent
that Securities are redeemed in-kind or sold, the size of the Trust will be, and
the diversity of the Trust may be, reduced. Sales may be required at a time when
Securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might
otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be more or less   
than the amount paid by the Unitholder, depending on the value of the Securities
at the time of redemption. Special federal income tax consequences will result  
if a Unitholder requests an in-kind distribution. See "Taxation".               

 The Redemption Price per Unit and the secondary market repurchase price per
Unit are equal to the pro rata share of each Unit in the Trust, determined on   
the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the Trust, (ii) the value of the Securities
in the Trust and (iii) dividends receivable on the Securities in the Trust      
trading ex-dividend as of the date of computation, less (a) amounts representing
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the Trust and (b) the accrued
expenses of the Trust. For these purposes, the Evaluator or Trustee will        
determine the value of the Securities in the manner set forth under "Public
Offering--Unit Price".                                                          

   The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary    
weekend and holiday closings, or any period during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the Securities is not reasonably practicable, or
for other periods as the SEC may permit.                                        

   Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form unless a Unitholder
makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in certificate form.   
Units are transferable by making a written request to the Trustee and, in the   
case of Units in certificate form, by presentation of the certificate to the    
Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments 
of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written request, and certificate or     
transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on the records of the Trustee  
and on the face of any certificate with the signature guaranteed by a           
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a  
signature guarantee program accepted by the Trustee. In certain instances the   
Trustee may require additional documents, including but not limited to, trust   
instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or
certificates of corporate authority. Fractional certificates will not be issued.
The Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each           
certificate reissued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may 
be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, stolen,  
mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of 
satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred. 
Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.      

   Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of dividends and other
amounts received by the Trust for each distribution. Within a reasonable time   
after the end of each year, each person who was a Unitholder during that year   
will receive a statement describing dividends and capital received, actual Trust
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the Securities and other Trust         
information. Unitholders may obtain evaluations of the Securities upon request  
to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your Trust,     
please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The Sponsor does not have 
access to individual account information.                                       

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portfolio Administration. The Trust is not an actively managed fund and,  
except as provided in the Trust Agreement, Securities generally will not be sold
or replaced after the initial deposit. The Sponsor may, however, direct that    
Securities be sold in certain limited circumstances to protect the Trust based  
on advice from the Supervisor. These situations may include events such as the  
issuer having defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the 
price of a Security having declined to such an extent, or other credit factors  
exist, so that in the opinion of the Supervisor retention of the Security would 
be detrimental to the Trust. If a public tender offer has been made for a       
Security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a Security, the
Trustee may either sell the Security or accept a tender offer for cash if the   
Supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of        
Unitholders. The Trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to Unitholders. In   
addition, the Trustee may sell Securities to redeem Units or pay Trust expenses.
The Trustee must reject any offer for securities or property other than cash in 
exchange for the Securities. If securities or property are nonetheless acquired 
by the Trust, the Sponsor may direct the Trustee to sell the securities or      
property and distribute the proceeds to Unitholders or to accept the securities 
or property for deposit in the Trust. Should any contract for the purchase of   
any of the Securities fail, the Sponsor will (unless substantially all of the   
moneys held in the Trust to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute     
Securities in accordance with the Trust Agreement) refund the cash and sales    
charge attributable to the failed contract to all Unitholders on or before the  
next Distribution Date.                                                         

When the Trust sells Securities, the composition and diversity of the     
Securities in the Trust may be altered. In order to obtain the best price for   
the Trust, it may be necessary for the Supervisor to specify minimum amounts    
(generally 100 shares) in which blocks of Securities are to be sold. In         
effecting purchases and sales of the Trust's portfolio securities, the Sponsor  
may direct that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to      
brokers, including brokers which may be affiliated with the Trust, the Sponsor, 
the Underwriter or dealers participating in the offering of Units. In addition, 
in selecting among firms to handle a particular transaction, the Sponsor may    
take into account whether the firm has sold or is selling units of unit         
investment trusts which it sponsors.                                            

Pursuant to an exemptive order, when each Trust terminates, it may be     
permitted to sell Securities to a new trust series if those Securities meet the 
investment strategy of the new trust. The exemption may enable each Trust to    
eliminate commission costs on these transactions. The price for those securities
will be the closing sale price on the sale date on the exchange where the       
Securities are principally traded, as certified by the Sponsor.                 

 Amendment of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee and the Sponsor may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely      
affect Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee).
The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or permit
acquisition of securities in addition to or substitution for the Securities     
(except as provided in the Trust Agreement). The Trustee will notify Unitholders
of any amendment.                                                               

 Termination. Each Trust will terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date or
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held in the Trust. A    
Trust may be terminated at any time with consent of Unitholders representing    
two-thirds of the outstanding Units or by the Trustee when the value of the     
Trust is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has exceeded  
$15,000,000) (the "Minimum Termination Value"). Unitholders will be notified of 
any termination. The Trustee may begin to sell Securities in connection with a  
Trust termination nine business days before, and no later than, the Mandatory   
Termination Date. Approximately thirty days before this date, the Trustee will  
notify Unitholders of the termination and provide a form enabling qualified     
Unitholders to elect an in kind distribution of Securities. You are qualified to
elect an in kind distribution of Securities at termination if you own at least  
1,000 Units of your Trust on the termination date (or such higher amount as may 
be required by your broker-dealer or selling agent). Any in kind distribution of
Securities at termination will be made in the manner and subject to the         
restrictions described under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". In   
order to receive an in kind distribution of Securities at termination, this form
or other notice acceptable to the Trustee must be received by the Trustee at    
least five business days prior to the Mandatory Termination Date. Unitholders   
will receive a final cash distribution within a reasonable time after the       
Mandatory Termination Date. All distributions will be net of Trust expenses and 
costs. Unitholders will receive a final distribution statement following        
termination. The Information Supplement contains further information regarding  
termination of the Trust. See "Additional Information".                         

 Limitations on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Underwriter, Supervisor Evaluator,
if any, and Trustee are under no liability for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee is not liable  
for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any of
the Securities. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the     
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and is not liable for any action
taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not liable  
for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed on the Securities, on it as 
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on the Trust, which the Trustee may be     
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Sponsor, Underwriter, and Supervisor may rely on any evaluation    
furnished by the Evaluator, if any, or the Trustee and have no responsibility   
for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Trustee shall be made in good   
faith upon the basis of the best information available to it.

potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to the Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional       
information about the Sponsor.                                                  

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as       
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Underwriter. Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., a Missouri limited partnership, is
the Underwriter for the Units. The Underwriter is a member of the National      
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and has its principal office at 12555   
Manchester Road, St. Louis, Missouri, 63131, (314) 515-2000.                    

The Underwriter, in its day to day activities, may act as a broker, agent,
principal, specialist or market maker in connection with the purchase and sale  
of equity securities, including the Securities. The Underwriter may also provide
investment banking services to, and may expect to receive or intend to seek     
compensation for underwriting services in the next three months from, some of   
the issuers of the Securities. Principals of the Underwriter may serve as a     
member of the board of directors of one or more issuers of the Securities or of 
affiliates of such issuers. Furthermore, the Underwriter may issue reports and  
make recommendations on the Securities. For any of these brokerage, specialist, 
market-making or investment banking activities, the Underwriter may receive     
additional compensation. The Underwriter may also receive compensation based on 
commissions generated by sales of Units in addition to its concession or agency 
commission. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".        

   Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under
the laws of the State of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit  
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, (800) 221-7668. If you have questions regarding your account or your
Trust, please contact the Trustee at its principal unit investment trust        
division offices or your financial advisor. The Sponsor does not have access to 
individual account information. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision  
and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    
Additional information regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information    
Supplement, including the Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to   
resign, the effect of a merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability  
to remove and replace the Trustee. See "Additional Information".                

TAXATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date of this      
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries 
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these
summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a  
non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. 
In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax    
consequences.                                                                   

   This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of
counsel to the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any    
conclusions set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to
review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax 
treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. This may not be sufficient
for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.     

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Assets of the Trust. The Trust is expected to hold one or more of the     
following: (i) shares of stock in corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated  
as equity for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) equity interests in real    
estate investment trusts (the "REIT Shares") that constitute interests in       
entities treated as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax        
purposes.                                                                       

 It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets, including assets
that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those         
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences    
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the    
assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets". Neither our counsel nor 
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets and
thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal 
income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.                                       

Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax 
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata       
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends and capital gains, if any) 
from each Trust Asset when such income would be considered to be received by you
if you directly owned the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have  
your distributions reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income    
from Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax        
purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses. 

   Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes of
Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of your 
Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain or  
loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your tax  
basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount received  
in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis in each  
Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, including sales charges,    
among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire
your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to adjust your tax  
basis after you acquire your Units (for example, in the case of certain         
dividends that exceed a corporation's accumulated earnings and profits, or in   
the case of certain distributions with respect to REIT Shares that represent a  
return of capital, as discussed below).                                         

If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net   
capital gain is generally 15% (generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and
15% tax brackets). These capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable
years beginning before January 1, 2009. For later periods, if you are an        
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is       
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The  
20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term      
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital 
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however, treats certain capital 
gains as ordinary income in special situations. Capital gain received from      
assets held for more than one year that is considered "unrecaptured section 1250
gain" (which may be the case, for example, with some capital gains attributable 
to the REIT Shares) is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of 25%. In the case of
capital gains dividends, the determination of which portion of the capital gains
dividend, if any, is subject to the 25% tax rate, will be made based on rules   
prescribed by the United States Treasury.                                       

  Dividends From Stocks. Certain dividends received with respect to the Stocks
may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as    
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates
generally apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009.              

Dividends From REIT Shares. Some dividends on the REIT Shares may be      
designated as "capital gain dividends," generally taxable to you as long-term   
capital gains. If you hold a Unit for six months or less or if your Trust holds 
a REIT Share for six months or less, any loss incurred by you related to the    
disposition of such REIT Share will be treated as a long-term capital loss to   
the extent of any long-term capital gain distributions received (or deemed to   
have been received) with respect to such REIT Share. Distributions of income or 
capital gains declared on the REIT Shares in October, November or December will 
be deemed to have been paid to you on December 31 of the year they are declared,
even when paid by the REIT during the following January. Other dividends on the 
REIT Shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income, although in    
limited circumstances, some of the ordinary income dividends from a REIT may    
also qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gains (as  
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from  
real estate investment trusts generally apply to taxable years beginning before 
January 1, 2009.                                                                

Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns Units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many        
dividends received by the Trust, because the dividends received deduction is not
available for dividends from most foreign corporations or from REITs.           

In-kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this   
prospectus, you may request an in-kind distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units or at your Trust's termination. By electing to receive an     
in-kind distribution, you will receive Trust Assets, plus, possibly, cash. You  
will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole Trust Assets in       
exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same Trust    
Assets held by your Trust. However, if you also receive cash in exchange for a  
Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a Trust Asset, you will generally        
recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you   
receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset or fractional portion.           

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, it is considered a sale for federal income   
tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any
loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in          
connection with the exchange of your Units of your Trusts for units of the next 
series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and        
subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have substantially   
identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue   
Code.                                                                           

Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the same   
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat some or
all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.         
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the    
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.                                 

Foreign Taxes. Distributions by your Trust that are treated as U.S. source
income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of domestic corporations) will       
generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and withholding in the case of     
Units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations or other      
non-U.S. persons, subject to any applicable treaty. If you are a foreign        
investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S.     
corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you may not be subject to U.S.      
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some of the income from   
your Trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of your Units, provided   
that certain conditions are met. You should consult your tax advisor with       
respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for U.S. tax      
purposes. You should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other U.S.   
tax withholding and reporting requirements.                                     

   Some distributions by your Trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you. Under the grantor   
trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign 
taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you may be entitled to a 
foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.                        

New York Tax Status. Based on the advice of Katten Muchin Rosenman, LLP,  
special counsel to the Trust for New York tax matters, under the existing income
tax laws of the State and City of New York, your Trust will not be taxed as a   
corporation, and the income of your Trust will pass through to the Unit holders 
in the same manner as for federal income tax purposes. You should consult your  
tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state or local taxation with respect to
your Units.                                                                     

TRUST OPERATING EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. The fees and expenses of the Trust will accrue on a daily basis. The
fees and expenses are generally paid out of the Capital Account of the Trust. It
is expected that Securities will be sold to pay these amounts, which will result
in capital gains or losses to Unitholders. See "Taxation". The Sponsor's,       
Evaluator's, Supervisor's and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval  
of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the   
category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index or, if 
this category is not published, in a comparable category.                       

Trustee's Fee. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee from the 
Trust set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One. 
The Trustee benefits to the extent there are funds in the Capital and Income    
Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders and the   
amounts earned by the Trustee are retained by the Trustee. Part of the Trustee's
compensation for its services to the Trust is expected to result from the use of
these funds.                                                                    

Compensation of Sponsor, Evaluator and Supervisor. The Sponsor and the    
Supervisor, which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee   
for providing bookkeeping and administrative services and portfolio supervisory 
services set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part   
One. These fees may exceed the actual costs of providing these services to the  
Trust but at no time will the total amount received for these services rendered 
to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts in any calendar year exceed the        
aggregate cost of providing these services in that year. The Evaluator will     
receive the annual fee for providing evaluation services set forth under        
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One.                       

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trust: (a) normal expenses (including the cost of mailing       
reports to Unitholders) incurred in connection with the operation of the Trust, 
(b) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (c) expenses of the Trustee 
(including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel designated by the        
Sponsor, (d) various governmental charges, (e) expenses and costs of any action 
taken by the Trustee to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of       
Unitholders, (f) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or      
expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust without negligence, bad    
faith or wilful misconduct on its part, (g) foreign custodial and transaction   
fees, (h) costs associated with liquidating the securities held in the Trust,   
(i) any offering costs incurred after the end of the initial offering period and
(j) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of the     
Trust. The Trust may pay the expenses of updating its registration statement    
each year.

RISK FACTORS 

  Price Volatility. Because the Trust invests in common stocks, you should
understand the risks of investing in common stocks before purchasing Units.     
These risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the 
general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks    
(and therefore Units) will fall. Common stocks are especially susceptible to    
general stock market movements. The value of common stocks often rises or falls 
rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies     
change. These perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding 
government economic policies, inflation, interest rates, economic expansion or  
contraction, political climates and economic or banking crises. The value of    
Units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the Trust and may be more  
or less than the price you originally paid for your Units. As with any          
investment, we cannot guarantee that the performance of the Trust will be       
positive over any period of time. Because the Trust is not actively managed, the
Trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in 
managed investments.                                                            

     Dividends. Common stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are
not obligations of the company. Accordingly, common stockholders have a right to
receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of          
creditors, bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company. This means that
common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board 
of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all
of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues   
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities   
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if the
company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common     
stock was issued first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to 
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.                                   

   Financial Services. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the bank, insurance and  
financial services sector in general.                                           

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse   
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly     
dependent on net interest margin. Bank profits have come under pressure as net  
interest margins have contracted. There is no certainty that such conditions    
will continue. Banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a 
result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets. As initial home purchasing
and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and  
other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in the real estate   
markets, which have been weak in the past, can have a substantial effect upon   
banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans   
secured by real estate. Banks and their holding companies are subject to        
extensive federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to
state regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements   
and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may  
pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in         
connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may             
substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if
deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the    
safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as       
increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases 
in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the   
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings  
and the ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of     
deposits nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or         
profitability of banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk  
of investment in the securities issued by such institutions.                    

The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,  
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have         
undergone substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes  
are embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,
enacted in August 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. The impact of    
these laws on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Securities 
in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The                
Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services overhaul legislation allows banks,        
securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial             
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors.
This legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened 
competition among existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to    
liberalize interstate banking has been enacted in recent years. Under the       
legislation, banks are able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any    
state. Since mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into      
branches. Consolidation may continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the expanded use of market     
value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for
investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale. Adoption  
of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported     
health of the industry, and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such    
problems. Additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For 
example, the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to   
the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and
there can be no certainty as to the effect, if any, that such changes would have
on the Securities in the Trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the  
deposit insurance system is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and    
proposed reforms of that system could, among other things, further restrict the 
ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount 
or number of deposits insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce      
profitability, as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become
more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank         
deposits. Banks face significant competition from other financial institutions  
such as mutual funds, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance   
companies, and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of  
regional and national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such     
legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously
prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into  
one unit. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to    
what, if any, manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or  
what ultimate effect such actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.          

The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank   
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by 
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of       
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and        
acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to
the effect, if any, such laws will have on the Securities or whether such       
approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.                                      

Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are   
subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates,  
and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes  
in the direction of the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health 
of customers, equity transaction volume, the level and direction of interest    
rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial  
stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies. Additionally,       
competitive pressures, including increased competition with new and existing    
competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need 
for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the 
profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage          
industries. Companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities
are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and             
self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in 
the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could adversely affect   
the stock prices of such companies.                                             

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including but not limited to interest rate movements, the imposition of premium 
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,      
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other     
natural or man-made disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual     
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the 
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject 
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate  
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or       
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy 
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit  
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of     
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology 
and the pressure to compete globally.                                           

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the    
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
       property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
         could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
  material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;                                                  

o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be   
          expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
         have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;                                

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
   property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;          

  o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
        appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
  light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
         insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;        

    o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;

    o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
   value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and              

     o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.         

   The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come under
increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered or   
enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance regulators  
are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on        
insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new
laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the  
condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine whether to
promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to predict      
whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or
scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any, such     
legislation would have on the industry.                                         

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that    
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as         
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some    
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

     Utility Issuers. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of the public utility industry and the     
risks which such an investment may entail. General problems of the public       
utility industry include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on      
invested capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by 
the public service commissions having jurisdiction, the difficulty in financing 
large construction programs during an inflationary period, the restrictions on  
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental, nuclear 
safety and other regulatory considerations, the difficulty of the capital       
markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities, the difficulty in         
obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, regulatory         
restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the     
retail and business customer, and the effects of energy conservation. There is  
no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the   
future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating 
and other expenses and debt service requirements. All of the public utilities   
which are issuers of the Securities have been experiencing many of these        
problems in varying degrees. Furthermore, utility stocks are particularly       
susceptible to interest rate risk, generally exhibiting an inverse relationship 
to interest rates. As a result, electric utility stock prices may be adversely  
affected as interest rates rise. Similarly, the success of certain companies is 
tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with       
intense competition between companies. There can be no assurance that these     
customers will place additional orders, or that an issuer of Securities will    
obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers.         
Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or from such    
customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the Securities.    

  Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, for example, establish the rates which may be charged and the
appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base, which must be approved by 
the state commissions. Certain utilities have had difficulty from time to time  
in persuading regulators, who are subject to political pressures, to grant rate 
increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment. Any unexpected
limitations could negatively affect the profitability of utilities whose budgets
are planned far in advance. In addition, gas pipeline and distribution companies
have had difficulties in adjusting to short and surplus energy supplies,        
enforcing or being required to comply with long-term contracts and avoiding     
litigation with their customers, on the one hand, or suppliers, on the other. In
2001, two California public electric utilities claimed inability to meet their  
obligations to their suppliers in the deregulated wholesale market for          
electricity due to regulatory restrictions on their ability to pass increasing  
costs along to their customers in the retail market. These defaults led their   
wholesale suppliers to threaten to institute involuntary bankruptcy proceedings 
against the utility companies. Subsequently, one of the utility companies filed 
a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of 
1978. Furthermore, regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and
other pressures, may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting  
or operational policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's        
profitability and its stock price. In late 2001, a trader and marketer of       
utilities, commodities and financial and risk management services filed a       
voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 as a result of being negatively  
impacted by several of these and other factors.                                 

Certain of the issuers of the Securities may own or operate nuclear   
generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review    
existing, and impose additional, requirements governing the licensing,          
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear generating projects 
in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases,   
construction delays and licensing difficulties. These have been caused by       
various factors, including inflation, high financing costs, required design     
changes and rework, allegedly faulty construction, objections by groups and     
governmental officials, limits on the ability to finance, reduced forecasts of  
energy requirements and economic conditions. This experience indicates that the 
risk of significant cost increases, delays and licensing difficulties remain    
present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear 
project. Also, nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned   
outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new     
regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining  
regulatory approval to return to service. A major accident at a nuclear plant   
anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation, 
construction or licensing of nuclear units.                                     

 In view of the uncertainties discussed above, there can be no assurance
that any utility company's share of the full cost of nuclear units under        
construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a     
company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units. The      
likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of    
concern described above varies, as does the potential severity of any adverse   
impact. It should be recognized, however, that one or more of such adverse      
events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material       
adverse impact on a company's financial condition, the results of its           
operations, its ability to make interest and principal payments on its          
outstanding debt or to pay dividends.                                           

  Other general problems of the electric, gas and water utility industries
(including state and local joint action power agencies) include rising costs of 
rail transportation to transport fossil fuels, the uncertainty of transmission  
service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions, changes in tax   
laws which adversely affect a utility's ability to operate profitably, increased
competition in service costs, recent reductions in estimates of future demand   
for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country, restrictions on        
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental          
considerations, uncertain availability and increased cost of capital,           
unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, including  
the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with conversion to       
alternate fuel sources such as coal, availability and cost of natural gas for   
resale, technical and cost factors and other problems associated with           
construction, licensing, regulation and operation of nuclear facilities for     
electric generation, including, among other considerations, the problems        
associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive
wastes, and the effects of energy and environmental conservation efforts. Each  
of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of
any Securities to make dividend payments and the value of such Securities on    
redemption of your Units.                                                       

Real Estate Investment Trusts. The Trust will invest in shares issued by  
REITs, domestic corporations or business trusts which invest primarily in income
producing real estate or real estate related loans or mortgages. REITs are      
financial vehicles that have as their objective the pooling of capital from a   
number of investors in order to participate indirectly in real estate ownership 
or financing. Thus, an investment in the Trust will be subject to risks similar 
to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate, in addition to    
securities markets risks, because of the Trust's investment in the securities of
companies in the real estate industry. These risks include:                     

o    declines in the value of real estate;                            

o    illiquidity of real property investments;                        

 o    risks related to general U.S. and global as well as local economic
conditions;                                                 

o    dependency on management skill;                                  

o    heavy cash flow dependency;                                      

o    possible lack of availability of mortgage funds;                 

o    excessive levels of debt or overleveraged financial structure;   

o    overbuilding;                                                    

o    extended vacancies, or obsolescence, of properties;              

o   increase in competition;                                          

o   increases in property taxes and operating expenses;               

o   changes in zoning laws;                                           

o   losses due to costs resulting from the clean-up of environmental  
problems;                                                     

 o   liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental
problems;                                                     

o   casualty or condemnation losses;                                  

o   natural or man-made disasters;                                    

o   economic or regulatory impediments to raising rents;              

o   changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand;                  

o   changes in the appeal of properties to tenants; and               

o   changes in interest rates, tax rates or operating expenses.       

   In addition to these risks, equity REITs may be more likely to be affected by
changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts. Further,   
REITs are dependent upon the management skills of the issuers and generally may 
not be diversified.                                                             

  The above factors may also adversely affect a borrower's or lessee's ability
to meet its obligations to the REIT. In the event of a default by a borrower or 
lessee, the REIT may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or
lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its           
investments.                                                                    

 A significant amount of the assets of a REIT may be invested in investments
in specific geographic areas or in specific property types, e.g., hotels,       
shopping malls, residential complexes, and office buildings. The impact of      
economic conditions on REITs also varies with geographic location and property  
type. Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in   
terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate         
generally and REITs in particular. In addition, you should be aware that REITs  
may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects. REITs
are also subject to                                                             

o    defaults by borrowers,                                           

o    the market's perception of the REIT industry generally,          

 o    the possibility of failing to qualify for tax-free pass-through of
income under the Internal Revenue Code, and                 

   o    the possibility of failing to maintain exemption from the Investment
Company Act of 1940.                                        

  A default by a borrower or lessee may cause the REIT to experience delays in
enforcing its rights as mortgagee or lessor and to incur significant costs      
related to protecting its investments.                                          

Some REITs in the Trust may be structured as UPREITs. An UPREIT owns an   
interest in a partnership that owns real estate. This can result in a potential 
conflict of interest between (1) shareholders of the REIT who may want to sell  
an asset and (2) other partnership interest holders who would be subject to tax 
liability if the REIT sells the property. In some cases, REITs have entered into
"no sell" agreements, which are designed to avoid taxing the holders of         
partnership units by preventing the REIT from selling the property. This        
arrangement may mean that the REIT would refuse a lucrative offer for an asset  
or be forced to hold on to a poor asset. Since parties to "no sell" agreements  
often do not disclose them, the Sponsor does not know whether any of the REITs  
in the Trust have entered into this kind of arrangement.                        

A REIT generally maintains comprehensive insurance on presently owned and 
subsequently acquired real property assets, including (1) liability, (2) fire   
and (3) extended coverage. However, there are certain types of losses, generally
of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes and floods, that may be           
uninsurable or not economically insurable, as to which the REIT's properties are
at risk in their particular locales. The management of a REIT uses its          
discretion in determining (1) amounts, (2) coverage limits and (3) deductibility
provisions of insurance. They generally aim to acquire appropriate insurance on 
their investments at reasonable costs and on suitable terms. This may result in 
insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be       
sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of  
the lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances,       
environmental considerations, and several other factors might make it unfeasible
to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or    
destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds that a REIT receives
might not be adequate to restore its economic position with respect to that     
property.                                                                       

Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be    
liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances 
on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability (1) whether or  
not the owner or operator caused or knew of the presence of the hazardous or    
toxic substances and (2) whether or not the storage of the substances was in    
violation of a tenant's lease. In addition, (1) the presence of hazardous or    
toxic substances, or (2) the failure to remediate the property properly, may    
hinder the owner's ability to borrow using that real property as collateral. We 
cannot give any assurance that one or more of the REITs in the Trust may not be 
currently liable or potentially liable for any of these costs in connection with
real estate assets they presently own or subsequently acquire while the shares  
of those REITs are held in the Trust.                                           

Consumer Staples. Your Trust may invest significantly in issuers that   
manufacture or sell consumer staples. The profitability of these companies will 
be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and   
consumer spending trends. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a    
recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth,
less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real          
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both  
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending  
habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or
reduced market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials 
costs, an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

Industrials. Your Trust may invest significantly in industrials companies.
General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess 
capacity and consumer spending trends. In addition, capital goods companies may 
also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic     
cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply  
of key materials, labor relations, government regulations, government contracts 
and e-commerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the      
industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may
have led to the overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in
the industry may face similar scrutiny.                                         

  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction equipment manufacturers.

   Health Care Issuers. An investment in Units of your Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the healthcare industry  
in general. Health care companies involved in advanced medical devices and      
instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care, hospital management/health        
services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the
healthcare field. These companies are subject to governmental regulation of     
their products and services, a factor which could have a significant and        
possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or   
services. Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition   
from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent        
protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological  
advances will render their products obsolete. The research and development costs
of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy governmental  
review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market.   
Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for      
several years. Such companies may also have persistent losses during a new      
product's transition from development to production, and revenue patterns may be
erratic.                                                                        

Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from 
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and   
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription      
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision  
of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare      
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid healthcare plans. The Sponsor and  
the Underwriter are unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if  
enacted, on the issuers of Securities in your Portfolio.                        

     Energy Issuers. Energy companies face risks related to political conditions
in oil producing regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the          
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide   
supply of oil and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, 
the ability to find and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically      
recoverable, operating hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer 
demand. Political conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in
the past. Political instability or war in these regions could have a negative   
impact on your investment. Oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile.
OPEC controls a substantial portion of world oil production. OPEC may take      
actions to increase or suppress the price or availability of oil. Various       
domestic and foreign government authorities and international cartels also      
impact these prices. Any substantial decline in these prices could have an      
adverse effect on energy companies. Energy companies depend on their ability to 
find and acquire additional energy reserves. The exploration and recovery       
process involves significant operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy
company has no assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves will be
economically recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government        
regulation, including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased
costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain   
companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged         
accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their       
financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar         
scrutiny.                                                                       

Technology companies. The market for technology products and services,
especially those related to the Internet, is characterized by rapidly changing  
technology, rapid products obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving     
industry standards and frequent new product introductions. The success of       
technology companies depends in substantial part on the timely and success      
introduction of new products. An unexpected change in one or more of the        
technologies affecting an issuer's products or in the market for products based 
on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect on an issuer's  
operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that companies will be
able to respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace.        

The market for certain technology products and services may have only 
recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an       
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain technology companies
may have only recently commenced operations or offered equity securities to the 
public. Such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited 
operating history on which to analyze future operating results. It is important 
to note that following its initial public offering, a security is likely to     
experience substantial stock price volatility and speculative trading.          
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, upon redemption of your Units or   
termination of the Trust, you will receive an amount greater than or equal to   
your initial investment.                                                        

    Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have     
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to  
fluctuate substantially. In addition, technology company stocks have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the     
operating performance of such companies. This market volatility may adversely   
affect the market price of the Securities and therefore your ability to redeem  
your Units, or roll over your Units into a new trust, at a price equal to or    
greater than the original price paid for such Units.                            

     Some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently
available only from a single source. There can be no assurance that in the      
future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and 
cost effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results and customer  
relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for, or
any interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally,   
many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product       
vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards.   
Any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or   
reduction of sales. Because many products and technology are incorporated into  
other related products, certain companies are often highly dependent on the     
performance of other computer, electronics and communications companies. There  
can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that  
an issuer of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders  
from other customers. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a  
relatively small concentration of products or technology with intense           
competition between companies. Accordingly, a decline in demand for such        
products or technology from such customers could have a material adverse impact 
on issuers of the Securities.                                                   

  The life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short,
resulting in volatile sales, earnings and stock prices for many technology      
companies. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technologies, competitive  
advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls.            
Historically, many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the       
consumer, as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or       
pricing power. Some of the large technology companies have been involved in     
antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future. A slowdown in        
corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company
revenues. Technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part
of their revenues. Any slowdown in international economies could hurt revenues. 

Consumer Cyclicals. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals
sector depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and 
is subject to severe competition. Therefore, the success of consumer cyclicals  
companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international  
economy, and to interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. A slowdown 
in the economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry. The success of
companies in the consumer cyclicals segment are also strongly affected by       
changes in demographics and consumer tastes.                                    

Consumer Products. Your Trust may invest significantly in issuers that  
manufacture or sell consumer products. The profitability of these companies will
be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and   
consumer spending trends. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a    
recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth,
less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real          
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both  
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending  
habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or
reduced market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials 
costs, an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

   Telecommunications Issuers. Because the Portfolio is also concentrated in the
telecommunications industry, the value of the Units may be susceptible to       
factors affecting the telecommunications industry. The telecommunications       
industry is subject to governmental regulation, and the products and services of
telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence. These factors
could affect the value of Units. Telephone companies in the United States, for  
example, are subject to both state and federal regulations affecting permitted  
rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be offered. Certain types of
companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a    
share of the market of their products. As a result, competitive pressures are   
intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility.                   

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications    
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

    While a portfolio concentrates on the securities of established suppliers of
traditional telecommunication products and services, the Trust may also invest  
in smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the development  
of new products and services. These smaller companies may present greater       
opportunities for capital appreciation, and may also involve greater risk than  
large, established issuers. Such smaller companies may have limited product     
lines, market or financial resources, and their securities may trade less       
frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger, more established
companies. As a result, the prices of the securities of such smaller companies  
may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of other        
issuers.                                                                        

In addition, recent federal legislation governing the United States     
telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional   
interpretation, which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are   
held by the Trust.                                                              

 Liquidity. Whether or not the stocks in the Trust are listed on a stock
exchange, the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an    
over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading market  
could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks. We cannot     
guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid.
The value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent.    

  Voting. Only the Trustee may sell or vote the stocks in the Trust. While
you may sell or redeem your Units, you may not sell or vote the stocks in the   
Trust. The Sponsor will instruct the Trustee how to vote the stocks. The Trustee
will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other     
shareholders if the Sponsor fails to provide instructions.                      

    No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

SPONSOR INFORMATION                                                             

     Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of the Trust. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is

relates only to the Sponsor and not to the Trust or to any other Series thereof.
The information is included herein only for the purpose of informing investors  
as to the financial responsibility of the Sponsor and its ability to carry out  
its contractual obligations. More detailed financial information will be made   
available by the Sponsor upon request).                                         

Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics    
requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust        
transactions to report personal securities transactions. This code is intended  
to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or     
misconduct with respect to your Trust.                                          

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as       
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

TRUSTEE INFORMATION                                                             

  The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the
laws of the State of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit      
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, (800) 221-7668. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and  
examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the     
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    

   The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of Securities for the Trust portfolio.             

     In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books
of record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trust. Such     
records shall include the name and address of, and the number of Units of the   
Trust held by, every Unitholder. Such books and records shall be open to        
inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual business  
hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to  
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the Securities held in the Trust.               

    Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of its responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement by     
executing an instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The    
Trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to   
all Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified 
in such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon        
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and
has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring    
Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a 
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee 
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes    
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or    
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee.            

    Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to  
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee   
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or  
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided   
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

TRUST TERMINATION                                                               

The Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of Unitholders     
representing 66 2/3% of the Units of such Trust then outstanding or by the      
Trustee when the value of the Securities owned by the Trust, as shown by any    
evaluation, is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has     
exceeded $15,000,000). The Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event 
that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet sold are tendered for    
redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Trust would be reduced 
to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time they were deposited 
in the Trust. If the Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold    
Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the    
entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement will terminate  
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held thereunder, but in 
no event will it continue beyond the Mandatory Termination Date.                

    Commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to, and no
later than, the Mandatory Termination Date, Securities may begin to be sold in  
connection with the termination of the Trust. The Sponsor will determine the    
manner, timing and execution of the sales of the Securities. The Sponsor shall  
direct the liquidation of the Securities in such manner as to effectuate orderly
sales and a minimal market impact. In the event the Sponsor does not so direct, 
the Securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such manner as   
the Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. At least 30 days before   
the Mandatory Termination Date the Trustee will provide written notice of any   
termination to all Unitholders of the appropriate Trust and in the case of a    
Trust will include with such notice a form to enable Unitholders owning the     
minimum number of Units described in the Prospectus to request an in-kind       
distribution of the Securities. To be effective, this request must be returned  
to the Trustee at least five business days prior to the Mandatory Termination   
Date. On the Mandatory Termination Date (or on the previous business day if a   
holiday) the Trustee will deliver each requesting Unitholder's pro rata number  
of whole shares of the Securities in the Trust to the account of the            
broker-dealer or bank designated by the Unitholder at Depository Trust Company. 
The value of the Unitholder's fractional shares of the Securities will be paid  
in cash. Unitholders not requesting an in-kind distribution will receive a cash 
distribution from the sale of the remaining Securities within a reasonable time 
following the Mandatory Termination Date. Regardless of the distribution        
involved, the Trustee will deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs,
expenses, advances or indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including    
estimated compensation of the Trustee, costs of liquidation and any amounts     
required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other   
governmental charges. Any sale of Securities in the Trust upon termination may  
result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not 
required at such time. The Trustee will then distribute to each Unitholder of   
each Trust his pro rata share of the balance of the Income and Capital Accounts.

  Within 60 days of the final distribution Unitholders will be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the   
Trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve  
are no longer necessary, it will make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the
same manner.                                                                    

                                                                       EMSPRO390

eTextbook Studying Features
Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.








The Amazon.com eTextbooks Store




Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Well, you can save up to 80% off the print list price when you rent and up to 60% off the print list price when you buy eTextbooks. Renting eTextbooks couldn’t be easier. With flexible rental options, you only have to pay for the time you need. Choose a rental length between 30 and 360 days and extend it for as little as one day. You even have the option to purchase at any time.




Don’t worry about breaking your back either. You’ll be able to carry your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around your heavy textbooks across campus. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Kindle, iPad, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle reading app.




Save time with digital interactive features that make paper books look prehistoric. Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube.
