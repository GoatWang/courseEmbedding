            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

              Three Keys for Effective Mobile Engagement
            
Put simply, mobile is not just another channel or device; it is a lifestyle. What this means is that you can’t just take your normal engagement strategy, deliver it to mobile and think it will work; because it won’t - at least not the way you're hoping. Instead, you need to optimize your engagement strategy for your consumers' mobile lifestyles. So when planning your mobile strategy, here are three areas you must consider.

              Whitepaper: Wi-Fi Credential Provisioning, Authentication and Management
            
Wi-Fi technology has now gained widespread adoption among consumers, enterprises, vendors, and wireless service providers around the world.  While simplicity and ease of use has driven widespread Wi-Fi deployment and adoption, fragmentation in approaches to user authentication and security have created acute challenges for communication service providers (CSPs) looking to scale Wi-Fi service provisioning to millions of subscribers.
This whitepaper explores various approaches to help CSPs optimize their investments in Wi-Fi.

              Three Keys for Effective Mobile Engagement
            
Put simply, mobile is not just another channel or device; it is a lifestyle. What this means is that you can’t just take your normal engagement strategy, deliver it to mobile and think it will work; because it won’t - at least not the way you're hoping. Instead, you need to optimize your engagement strategy for your consumers' mobile lifestyles. So when planning your mobile strategy, here are three areas you must consider.

Corporate history[edit]
Smith Micro initially focused on dial-up modem and fax software technology, distributing predominantly to OEM computer software/hardware manufacturers. With an IPO in 1995, Smith Micro became publicly traded in the NASDAQ under the symbol SMSI. Initial stock offering values were approx. $12.75 per share.[6]
By the late '90s, dial-up internet access was being replaced by cable internet, DSL, and wireless broadband technologies due to their substantially higher speed and reliability. This change led Smith Micro to re-apply its network connection expertise to new, wireless and mobile network software. Network connection management became a specialization of the company and, as such, Smith Micro developed products of interest to large-scale mobile network operators such as AT&T, Bell Canada, Orange, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Vodafone. While fax and modem-related products were still being sold, the QuickLink family of wireless connection manager became the company's primary source of revenue in the early 2000s.
In 2005, Smith Micro acquired Allume Systems and their StuffIt data compression software. Shortly after, Smith Micro acquired Israel-based image editing company, PhoTags. Following these and other acquisitions (e frontier America and busineSMS.com Software)[7] Smith Micro expanded its overall consumer business presence, but retained focus on network and wireless-related products.
In early 2008, the company began to expand its portfolio to wireless access and mobile services. Smith Micro introduced solutions for enhanced mobile communications, such as push-to-talk software, visual voicemail services, and video streaming. Smith Micro also expressed interest in WiMAX broadband,[8] a newly developed cellular technology, typically considered to be a 4G wireless protocol, and a candidate for the replacement of current 3G cellular systems.

In 2005, Smith Micro acquired Allume Systems and their StuffIt data compression software. Shortly after, Smith Micro acquired Israel-based image editing company, PhoTags. Following these and other acquisitions (e frontier America and busineSMS.com Software)[7] Smith Micro expanded its overall consumer business presence, but retained focus on network and wireless-related products.
In early 2008, the company began to expand its portfolio to wireless access and mobile services. Smith Micro introduced solutions for enhanced mobile communications, such as push-to-talk software, visual voicemail services, and video streaming. Smith Micro also expressed interest in WiMAX broadband,[8] a newly developed cellular technology, typically considered to be a 4G wireless protocol, and a candidate for the replacement of current 3G cellular systems.

Corporate history[edit]
Smith Micro initially focused on dial-up modem and fax software technology, distributing predominantly to OEM computer software/hardware manufacturers. With an IPO in 1995, Smith Micro became publicly traded in the NASDAQ under the symbol SMSI. Initial stock offering values were approx. $12.75 per share.[6]
By the late '90s, dial-up internet access was being replaced by cable internet, DSL, and wireless broadband technologies due to their substantially higher speed and reliability. This change led Smith Micro to re-apply its network connection expertise to new, wireless and mobile network software. Network connection management became a specialization of the company and, as such, Smith Micro developed products of interest to large-scale mobile network operators such as AT&T, Bell Canada, Orange, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Vodafone. While fax and modem-related products were still being sold, the QuickLink family of wireless connection manager became the company's primary source of revenue in the early 2000s.
In 2005, Smith Micro acquired Allume Systems and their StuffIt data compression software. Shortly after, Smith Micro acquired Israel-based image editing company, PhoTags. Following these and other acquisitions (e frontier America and busineSMS.com Software)[7] Smith Micro expanded its overall consumer business presence, but retained focus on network and wireless-related products.
In early 2008, the company began to expand its portfolio to wireless access and mobile services. Smith Micro introduced solutions for enhanced mobile communications, such as push-to-talk software, visual voicemail services, and video streaming. Smith Micro also expressed interest in WiMAX broadband,[8] a newly developed cellular technology, typically considered to be a 4G wireless protocol, and a candidate for the replacement of current 3G cellular systems.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Three Keys for Effective Mobile Engagement







Tweet




















Over the past 20 years, we have become increasingly dependent on mobile technology in our daily lives and routines. Now in 2017, having a flip phone, or no phone rather, is almost unheard of. Nearly everyone has a smartphone (some people even use more than one on a regular basis) and they carry it with them everywhere to do pretty much anything.
In fact, according to WirelessWeek, 65% of digital media is consumed with mobile devices. With such an immense amount of media being digested via mobile, reaching consumers on their smartphones is absolutely essential.  However, to engage effectively with your customers via mobile you must transform the way you think about it.

4 Ways to Improve the Efficiency of Mobile Ad Spend with Data-driven Insights







Tweet



















As an advertiser – and especially a digital marketer – it’s safe to assume that a day doesn’t go by where you’re not concerned about the quality of your mobile ad spend. You may even begin to wonder whether you’re spending too much.
According to the BIA/Kelsey Industry Watch report, mobile ad spending in the U.S. will grow from $33 billion in 2016 to $72 billion by 2021. In addition, there’s an eMarketer report published in November 2016 showing that digital ad spending surpassed TV ad spend for the first time in 2016.

Revitalize Black Friday with Contextual Mobile Engagement







Tweet



















Twas the weeks before Christmas and all through the towns, retailers are stirring over chaos all around. The shelves were stocked with ultimate care, in hopes that Black Friday shoppers soon would be there.
The holiday season is coming and brick-and-mortar retailers are feeling the pressure to handle high store foot traffic and satisfy customer demand throughout the omnichannel path-to-purchase. According to the National Retail Federation, Black Friday, the official kick-off to the holiday shopping season, can account for up to 30 percent of retailers’ annual sales. To whip up a holiday buying craze with their customers, retailers are offering early bird promotions and discounts. However these strategies backfired last year, with Black Friday sales falling to $10.21 billion in 2015 — nearly a 12 percent decrease from 2014.

Where is My Mobile Concierge When I Need it?

Smartphones have fundamentally changed how consumers interact with brands. It’s difficult to find anyone these days who hasn’t used their smartphone to interact with their favorite stores. The beauty of this change is that we can more easily choose how, when, and where we interact with consumer brands.
Sort of like offering a mobile concierge to your customers. But we’ll get to that shortly...
