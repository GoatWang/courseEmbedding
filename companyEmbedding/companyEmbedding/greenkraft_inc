                                - 
SANTA ANA, Calif., Feb.  06, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greenkraft, Inc. (OTCQB:GKIT), a nationally recognized player in the alternative fuel engine and vehicle market, announces that it will realize well over $1,000,000 of new revenue in 2017.  This revenue will be achieved through the monetization of Greenkraft’s three major product lines which are trucks, conversion systems, and engines.  Some of the trucks that GKIT is offering are truly one of kind in their class and currently the ONLY alternative to diesel fuel trucks, especially from 19,500 to 33,000 GVW.  In addition, Greenkraft trucks offer unparalleled maneuverability compared to other available options because of the unique forward cabin design.
Conversion systems are quickly becoming a huge revenue source for Greenkraft too because the Company can take various existing truck models that run on gasoline fuel and completely convert it to run on CNG or LPG making it much less expensive to operate the fleet.  The third product line that is contributing to GKIT’s revenue increase are engines for repowering trucks with different fuel options, and engines for agriculture equipment and stationary machines used in various industries with different fuel options.  George Gemayel, CEO of Greenkraft, Inc. says, “Greenkraft is already the leader in alternative fuel truck options and is now going to be entering new exciting markets that will tremendously increase both revenue and name recognition.  The Company firmly believes that these new alternative fuel innovations will quickly become the standard in the trucking sector and beyond.  2017 is going to be an amazingly exciting and profitable time for Greenkraft.”  Greenkraft, Inc. continues to work diligently to provide long-term value for the Company and its shareholders alike by increasing revenues and executing their clearly defined expansion plan that will allow GKIT to become the #1 source for alternative fuel trucks in North America.  Greenkraft will constantly update the public and its shareholders on all Company progress by way of regular press releases and timely SEC filings. About Greenkraft, Inc. (OTCQB: GKIT): Greenkraft, Inc., a profitable, revenue generating publicly traded company, is a major manufacturer of alternative fuel automotive products. Greenkraft, Inc. was created to introduce clean, green, efficient, automotive products that run on alternative fuels. GKIT offers alternative commercial forward cabin trucks and alternative fuel systems for various vehicles. GKIT's commercial trucks are powered by alternative fuels such CNG and LPG in Classes 3,4,5,6, and 7.  Greenkraft, Inc. designs, develops, and manufactures compressed American natural gas and propane gas forward cabin trucks, alternative fuel systems and alternative fuel engines.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Greenkraft, Inc. Projects Millions in Revenue in 2017 with the Monetization of their Three Major Product Lines
BY GlobeNewswire— 7:00 AM ET 02/06/2017


SANTA ANA, Calif., Feb.  06, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greenkraft, Inc. (GKIT) , a nationally recognized player in the alternative fuel engine and vehicle market, announces that it will realize well over $1,000,000 of new revenue in 2017.  This revenue will be achieved through the monetization of Greenkraft’s three major product lines which are trucks, conversion systems, and engines.  Some of the trucks that GKIT is offering are truly one of kind in their class and currently the ONLY alternative to diesel fuel trucks, especially from 19,500 to 33,000 GVW.  In addition, Greenkraft (GKIT) trucks offer unparalleled maneuverability compared to other available options because of the unique forward cabin design.
Conversion systems are quickly becoming a huge revenue source for Greenkraft (GKIT) too because the Company can take various existing truck models that run on gasoline fuel and completely convert it to run on CNG or LPG making it much less expensive to operate the fleet.  The third product line that is contributing to GKIT’s revenue increase are engines for repowering trucks with different fuel options, and engines for agriculture equipment and stationary machines used in various industries with different fuel options.  George Gemayel, CEO of Greenkraft, Inc. (GKIT) says, “Greenkraft is already the leader in alternative fuel truck options and is now going to be entering new exciting markets that will tremendously increase both revenue and name recognition.  The Company firmly believes that these new alternative fuel innovations will quickly become the standard in the trucking sector and beyond.  2017 is going to be an amazingly exciting and profitable time for Greenkraft.”  Greenkraft, Inc. (GKIT) continues to work diligently to provide long-term value for the Company and its shareholders alike by increasing revenues and executing their clearly defined expansion plan that will allow GKIT to become the #1 source for alternative fuel trucks in North America.  Greenkraft (GKIT) will constantly update the public and its shareholders on all Company progress by way of regular press releases and timely SEC filings.

 Greenkraft, Inc. (OTCQB: GKIT) Now Offering an Allison Transmission (NYSE: ALSN) for Their Alternative Fuel Trucks.			 July 11, 2016/in News /by adminGreenkraft Inc. (OTCQB: GKIT), a California based manufacturer of alternative fuel trucks and alternative fuel systems is pleased to announce that the Company is now manufacturing trucks designed to run with a package from Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ALSN)! Greenkraft trucks are used in a variety of industries and are considered to be among the best performing in the heavy-duty market. The first line of trucks with Allison are available in classes from 19,500 LBS to 26,000 LBS GVWR, as well as other versions Greenkraft has in development for up to 33,000 LBS GVWR. These new trucks are game-changers not only for the Company but for the entire alternative energy vehicle industry as a whole!
The Allison package will provide a fully automatic transmission for Greenkraft’s clients. When factoring all of the life cycle costs, including the price of the vehicle, fuel and preventive maintenance  along with increased driver retention, an Allison Automatic-equipped vehicle costs less to operate than a competitively-equipped vehicle of lessor quality. Additionally, due to their ease of use, Allison fully automatic transmissions expand the size of the driver pool. Even experienced drivers benefit from more precise, safer handling and improved comfort. Fully automatic shifting reduces driver fatigue and keeps a driver’s attention on the road.
Based on the availability of the Allison package, Greenkraft is pleased to further enhance its offering of alternative fuel truck solutions for businesses across the United States.

Greenkraft, Inc. Projects Millions in Revenue in 2017 with the Monetization of their Three Major Product Lines
SANTA ANA, Calif., Feb.  06, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greenkraft, Inc. (OTCQB:GKIT), a nationally recognized player in the alternative fuel engine and vehicle market, announces that it will realize well over $1,000,000 of new revenue in 2017.  This revenue will be achieved through the monetization of Greenkraft’s three major product lines which are trucks, conversion systems, and engines.  Some of the trucks that GKIT is offering are truly one of kind in their class and currently the ONLY alternative to diesel fuel trucks, especially from 19,500 to 33,000 GVW.  In addition, Greenkraft trucks offer unparalleled maneuverability compared to other available options because of the unique forward cabin design.
Conversion systems are quickly becoming a huge revenue source for Greenkraft too because the Company can take various existing truck models that run on gasoline fuel and completely convert it to run on CNG or LPG making it much less expensive to operate the fleet.  The third product line that is contributing to GKIT’s revenue increase are engines for repowering trucks with different fuel options, and engines for agriculture equipment and stationary machines used in various industries with different fuel options.  George Gemayel, CEO of Greenkraft, Inc. says, “Greenkraft is already the leader in alternative fuel truck options and is now going to be entering new exciting markets that will tremendously increase both revenue and name recognition.  The Company firmly believes that these new alternative fuel innovations will quickly become the standard in the trucking sector and beyond.  2017 is going to be an amazingly exciting and profitable time for Greenkraft.”  Greenkraft, Inc. continues to work diligently to provide long-term value for the Company and its shareholders alike by increasing revenues and executing their clearly defined expansion plan that will allow GKIT to become the #1 source for alternative fuel trucks in North America.  Greenkraft will constantly update the public and its shareholders on all Company progress by way of regular press releases and timely SEC filings. About Greenkraft, Inc. (OTCQB: GKIT): Greenkraft, Inc., a profitable, revenue generating publicly traded company, is a major manufacturer of alternative fuel automotive products. Greenkraft, Inc. was created to introduce clean, green, efficient, automotive products that run on alternative fuels.
