Your personalized new promotional products will do more than offer people an item that they can use constantly; they will promote your business and remind people that you are just a phone call away.

At National Pen, we have several new promotional products that will impress anyone who receives them. As with all our pens, you can personalize the new promotional products to bear your company's name, the street address, the telephone number and your website address. These pens can even be printed with your logo in full color. Our online tools with a wide selection of colors and fonts makes it easy to customize a new promotional product that will market your brand and help people remember you.

All our custom new promotional products are low priced to easily fit into your advertising budget. They are highly cost-effective, but they are also of extremely high quality. National Pen products are built to last so that they can keep your company's name in your customers' minds. You will always be proud to hand out our personalized pens to promote your company.

Sending your regular customers promotional pens is a great way to remind them that you appreciate their business. Customized products are also good for attracting new clients. If you're going to participate in a trade show, giving away pens would encourage the passers-by to remember your booth and select your services. Any time that you need to market your business at a corporate event, customized pens will be a gift that the recipient can remember. Whether as a giveaway prize or part of a marketing set, new promotional products by National Pen can help set your company apart from the competition.

National Graphite Board Approves Bulk Sample Program

Dec 06, 2012, 08:30 ET
		  		  						
						 from   National Graphite Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


LAS VEGAS, Dec. 6, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- National Graphite Corp. (NGRC) is pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has approved a mini bulk sample program on the company's Chedic Voltaire Graphite Mine property.
The mini-bulk sample program will be designed to extract a significant representation of the multiple graphitic zones on the property. The samples will be prepared for metallurgical test work and will be forwarded to a laboratory for processing in a timely manner. Initial test work will determine both the average carbon content and flake size distribution of the graphitic material.  Additional testing will help determine the most cost effective concentration processes required to achieve a high purity fungible graphite product. 
High quality graphite is enjoying price escalation on the world markets due to heavy demand for uses in environmentally  responsible products such as hybrid electric vehicles, solar panels, nuclear plants, fuel cells and ion-lithium batteries.  Graphite prices are currently in the $1,500 to $3,000 per ton range depending on the carbon content and flake size of the final product. 
National Graphite Corp. currently holds the rights to the Chedic Voltaire, past producing, graphite mine in NW Nevada near Carson City, a city with a large and experienced mining work force.
NGRC plans on advancing the project through the exploration and development stages.

Corporate Profile

The answer to the graphite supply problem

Northern Graphite owns a 100% interest in the Bissett Creek deposit, located in eastern Ontario. Bissett Creek is an advanced stage project with a bankable Final Feasibility Study and its major environmental permit.  The Company believes Bissett Creek has the highest margin, best flake size distribution and lowest marketing risk of any new graphite project, and has the added advantages of low capital costs and realistic production levels relative to the size of the market.

What management thinks about...

Graphite PricesPrices for large flake graphite increased from about $700 per tonne in 2005 to approximately $2,800 in 2012 due to the growth in China and other emerging economies.  They have since declined to about $1,000 due to the slow down in China and its steel industry, a lack of growth in the US, Europe and Japan, and a strengthening US dollar.  Further price declines are unlikely as many uneconomic mines have closed and a number of Chinese mines have been shut down for environmental reasons.  Demand from lithium ion batteries is growing at over 20% per year and has already caused a significant rise in lithium prices.  It now accounts for about a third of the graphite market and we are getting close to the point where batteries and not steel, will drive graphite prices.

Graphite SupplyChina produces over 70% of the world’s graphite.  Its industry is very fragmented with many labor and environmental issues and mines that are getting older, deeper and higher cost.  China is modernizing and consolidating much of its mining industry to provide for more professional management of its resources. Recently, over 30% of Chinese flake graphite production was shut down, either because it was uneconomic or for environmental reasons.  Also, China wants to export value added products, not raw materials, and therefore it has an export licensing system and resource nationalism is an increasing concern.  For these reasons, Chinese graphite production and exports are likely to decline in the future and stable, secure sources of high quality supply in the west are needed. Recently China announced that it is going to build a flake graphite stockpile equal to 80% of annual production by 2020.

GrapheneGraphene is one of the top research topics in the world with billions of dollars of funding committed.  At present there is no process for making commercial quantities of graphene and there are no commercial products based on graphene.   Dozens if not hundreds of organizations are working on these challenges and once solved, the results could revolutionize the way we work and live.  Natural graphite is one source of graphene and will probably supply the lower technology applications such as conductive inks and coatings and composite materials.  There are up to three million layers of graphene in a one millimeter thickness of graphite so a little goes a long way.How graphene might change the world


Electric VehiclesEVs are not going to replace the internal combustion engine.  However, there are many uses and markets where they make sense including short range commuting, city driving, taxis and delivery vehicles.  EVs only need to become modestly successful to have a big effect on the graphite market.  If one per cent of the new car market (about 700,000 cars) were EVs, world flake graphite production would have to increase by about 30% and multiple new mines would be required.  The proposed Tesla “gigafactory” requires up to six new mines.  China alone plans on having five million EVs by 2020.







New MarketsExpandable graphite is one of the fastest growing markets along with Li ion batteries.  It involves treating XL flake graphite with a dilute acid solution and heating it to cause the flakes to split apart and increase hundreds of time in volume.  This material is pressed into sheets which can be cut into shapes and used in many applications including thermal management in consumer electronics, advanced building materials, heat and corrosion resistant gaskets, fuel cells and flow batteries.  Fuel cells are already a billion dollar industry with commercial buses, forklift trucks, standby power plants, etc. already in operation.  There are commercial fuel cell cars now and many observers expect them to become more popular more quickly than EVs.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
