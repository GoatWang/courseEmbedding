Job Details
               Brookfield has invested in property, renewable energy, infrastructure and private equity for over 100 years, with a focus on investments that provide consistent and sustainable cash flows and with special attention placed on income and capital preservation. This investment style has served us well throughout market cycles and has provided stability in times of turbulence. Today, Brookfield manages over $225 billion* of investments for our shareholders and institutional investors. Although we are generally known for managing direct investments in real estate, infrastructure and power, our experience in managing diversified portfolios of securities extends over 30 years. As the controlling shareholder of a number of leading global financial services companies, we have been directly involved in the successful establishment and growth of various investment management operations. In particular, we have built expertise in the management of institutional portfolios, retail mutual funds and securitized credit investments. Through the acquisition of a number of boutique investment management firms, including Hyperion Capital and KG Redding, we further broadened our public securities platform to include investment-grade and high-yield debt, as well as global real estate and infrastructure equities. In recent years, we formally established Brookfield Investment Management Inc. ("Brookfield Investment Management") to build upon this foundation and lead our public securities efforts going forward. Under the leadership and direction of Craig Noble, Brookfield Investment Management's objective has been to create an investment management organization that reflects Brookfield's strengths as one of the world's leading alternative asset management firms. To that end, Brookfield Investment Management offers an array of yield-oriented products focused within those industry sectors in which Brookfield maintains a depth of expertise. Brookfield Investment Management is proud to maintain a seasoned team of investment professionals and serve institutional and retail clients located throughout the globe, with nearly $17 billion* of assets currently under management. The firm endeavors to uphold Brookfield's heritage of investment and contribute to its legacy of success.
