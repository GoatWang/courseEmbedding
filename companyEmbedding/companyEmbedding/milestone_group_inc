Radio stations[edit]
The Milestone Group used to outright own three local radio stations in the UK under the Passion Radio branding. One was sold between 2005 & 2006, while the other two were shut down:

Passion 107.9 - local radio station for the Oxfordshire area (Now under the ownership of Passion Radio (Oxford) Limited; now known as Jack FM 2 Oxfordshire, but referred to on-air as "Jack 2").

It also held stake in four other radio stations alongside the stations' other investors. Eventually, Milestone's stake in these was sold off between 2005 & 2006:

Kestrel FM (54%) - local radio station for Basingstoke and the surrounding area of north Hampshire. (Sold to the Tindle Radio Group, then Celador; now known as The Breeze (Basingstoke)

The Milestone Group used to own multiple publications through its former Tri-Media Publishing subsidiary, ten of them under the Courier Newspapers brand:

Auto Weekly - information on the buying and selling of cars in Oxfordshire.
Breakout! - published immediately before school holidays, a publication distributed in primary schools to children.
South Oxfordshire Courier - free newspaper for southern Oxfordshire, formerly "Courier Journal".

Auto Weekly & Property Weekly are currently owned by The Oxfordshire Guardian Group, operated in conjunction with the Oxfordshire Guardan.
The South Oxfordshire Courier, after coming under the ownership of the paper's managing director in 2006, was retired in 2008 in favor of the branding of its sister publication, the Oxford Journal, which itself was retired soon afterwards, before being re-launched in 2012 under Taylor Newspapers, but was once again retired for the second & final time in 2014 in favor of an extension to the Oxfordshire Guardian.
