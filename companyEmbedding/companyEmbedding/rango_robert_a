IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enevate 
      Corporation, a leading developer of advanced silicon Lithium-ion 
      (Li-ion) batteries, announced that Robert 
      A. Rango has been named as the company’s new President and CEO. 
      Brian Wong is transitioning out of his leadership of the organization to 
      pursue other interests. Mr. Rango is highly respected in the high 
      technology industry with over 30 years of experience and has compiled an 
      impressive track record of growing profitable multi-million and 
      multi-billion dollar businesses, often by identifying and developing 
      first-to-market technologies.
    


      “I’m excited to join this team,” Bob 
      Rango said, “especially right now as Enevate is on the verge of 
      introducing the industry’s first silicon Li-ion battery products for 
      smartphones and other mobile devices. The battery market is expanding as 
      a flurry of new devices are launched and customers are hungry for 
      technology that can increase battery capacity and reduce charge times. 
      Enevate has made tremendous strides toward satisfying this need.”
    

Mr. 
      Rango previously held a number of key executive and technical 
      positions in the mobile and wireless industry, most recently as 
      Executive Vice President and General Manager at Broadcom Corporation. 
      Mr. Rango held various leadership positions at Broadcom from 2002 to 
      2014. Prior to that he was with Agere Systems, Lucent Technologies, and 
      AT&T Bell Labs. Mr. Rango holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical 
      Engineering from SUNY at Stony Brook and a Master’s Degree in Electrical 
      Engineering from Cornell University. He currently sits on the Boards of 
      Directors of multiple public companies.
    

      “Bob Rango is the ideal person for this responsibility, because he 
      excels in managing and growing innovative businesses, and has strong 
      ties in the mobile device sector,” said Ted 
      Alexander, an Enevate board member and partner at Mission Ventures. 
      “We’re all grateful to Brian for his drive and skill in bringing Enevate 
      to where it is today, and we’re very excited about the future.”
    

      Brian Wong, who joined Enevate in 2010 as President & CEO, will support 
      Bob Rango during a transition period and is committed to seeing the 
      tremendous progress continue. “I’ve enjoyed leading Enevate over the 
      last six plus years to build the company into what it is today,” added 
      Wong.
