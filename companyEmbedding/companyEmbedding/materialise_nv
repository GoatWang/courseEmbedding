About Materialise Software
Digitization has stirred a new wave of innovation. Driven by this evolution, game-changing businesses and industries are exploring new opportunities that go beyond conventional solutions. Materialise Software is at the core of this drive. We provide leading software solutions for Additive Manufacturing (AM) – also called 3D Printing – to boost the AM ecosystem and enable customers and companies around the world to create ground-breaking applications.





















The Materialise 3D Print Suite






















"We purposely built the suite to fit new industries embracing 3D Printing and our software is still growing and maturing to meet our existing customers' evolving production requirements. We are committed to driving the trends of today and the future in 3D Printing to raise the bar of Additive Manufacturing."Stefaan Motte, Vice President of Software at Materialise





































When Materialise purchased its first 3D printer, we were soon confronted with the challenge of creating a file that could successfully print – and we quickly got to work on making the process easier. The first lines of code were written in 1990 and grew into the data preparation software Magics. Over the past decades more software solutions were added, resulting in the industry-leading Materialise Magics 3D Print Suite: a reliable software backbone for a wide range of industries.
Our software suite brings design enhancement, data preparation, automatic support generation, production management, workflow automation, machine communication and machine control to a whole new level. You can choose an off-the-shelf product or create a fully customized solution together with us. We are proud to offer you this all-comprehensive, open software platform that breaks down the barriers between meaningful applications and the expanding range of 3D printers that make them a physical reality.





































"Automation and control is key in a modern AM factory. It's the path to keeping cost and lead time at an acceptable level while continuously monitoring the printing process."Eva Descamps, Marketing & Strategy Manager at Materialise






















Our solutions enable you to leverage both your product design and production process, as well as scaling your 3D printing business with efficiency and reliability. Whether you want to create one-off prototypes, manufacture large series or improve your home-built 3D printers, we have more than 25 years of experience in software development that will empower your business.
 
OEM Solutions
Our products are integrated with each other, creating a unique software platform for 3D Printing. Through the platform, printer manufacturers can access 3D-printable content from various sources and a wide portfolio of 3D printing technology. By bundling your 3D printing machines with Materialise software, your customers have access to the industry standard.
Our open software platform is also compatible with other innovative tools and technologies like FEA analysis and quality control hardware, and can be integrated with existing business systems such as CRM, ERP and PLM systems to enhance and expand our software platform even further. This enables Materialise software users to benefit from other technology within their trusted Materialise environment, as well as enabling users of other technologies to access Materialise solutions.






















“It's fascinating to collaborate with machine manufacturers and to develop powerful software tailored to their machines. The result of our collaborations are products that embody our mutual strengths."Hyerin Seo, Account Manager at Materialise

Siemens and Materialise Technology Integration Streamlines Product Design Through 3D Printing


PLANO, Texas & LEUVEN, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Siemens and Materialise have integrated additive manufacturing (AM) 
      technology from Materialise into Siemens’ NX™ software, streamlining the 
      design to manufacturing process for the rapidly growing universe of 
      products being produced using AM (a.k.a. 3D printing). The new solution 
      leverages proven Materialise technology to enable NX computer-aided 
      design, manufacturing and engineering (CAD/CAM/CAE) software to 
      accurately and completely prepare CAD models for powder bed fusion and 
      material jetting 3D printing processes. As a result, the time necessary 
      to go from a completed product design to a fully 3D-printed part could 
      be reduced by 30 percent or more. A partnership agreement between the 
      two companies, announced by Materialise on January 6, 2017, enables 
      Siemens’ product lifecycle management (PLM) software business to sell 
      the integrated solution through its global sales channels.
    

      “Today’s announcement represents a huge leap forward in making additive 
      manufacturing a mainstream production practice for our customers,” said 
      Zvi Feuer, senior vice president of Manufacturing Engineering Software 
      for Siemens PLM Software. “Until now, the additive manufacturing process 
      required manufacturers to work with two separate systems – one for 
      product design, and another to prepare that design for 3D printing. The 
      data translation issues and lack of associativity between these two 
      systems created a process that was time consuming and subject to errors. 
      By eliminating these issues, we are helping to expand the adoption of 
      additive manufacturing as a universally accepted production tool.”
    

      As one of the world’s most widely used digital product development 
      applications, NX is used throughout multiple industries to design some 
      of the world’s most sophisticated products, from automobiles, aircraft 
      and marine vessels, to consumer products, medical devices and machinery. 
      Likewise, technology from the Materialise Magics 3D Print Suite enables 
      all commonly-adopted AM processes for end-part manufacturing, including 
      powder bed fusion, as well as material jetting, which promises to 
      further accelerate AM‘s evolution from a prototyping to a full-scale 
      manufacturing technology.
    

      The solution being announced today seamlessly and associatively links NX 
      with Materialise lattice technology, support structures design, 3D 
      nesting, build tray preparation, and build processors framework 
      technology for additive manufacturing. This eliminates data translation, 
      conversions and ensures that changes to digital product design models, 
      are automatically and associatively reflected in the 3D print jobs. The 
      result is greater model accuracy, higher quality and a much faster 
      design to production process.
    

      “Additive manufacturing is a reality now, even in highly regulated 
      markets like aerospace and healthcare,” says Johan Pauwels, Executive 
      Vice President at Materialise. “By bringing together solutions from 
      Siemens and Materialise, we are optimizing and simplifying the workflow 
      for design, engineering and manufacturing of components. For the past 25 
      years, our neutral backbone of solutions has pushed the boundaries of 
      additive manufacturing technologies. We’re pleased to partner with 
      Siemens, who truly understands large-scale industrial manufacturing 
      environments and shares our belief that designers and engineers can 
      create better products if additive manufacturing is embedded into their 
      mainstream business processes.”
    

      An initial set of technology is available in the most current version of 
      NX (NX 11.0.1) via new modules targeted for additive manufacturing.

      Manufacturing Engineering Solutions at Siemens, at the Materialise World 
      Summit in Brussels: April 20, 2017. For more information visit: worldsummit.materialise.com
