Valley Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company with $314 million in total assets as of June 30, 2017. Its community banking subsidiary, Valley Bank & Trust, is an independent, family-owned Colorado bank serving individuals and business customers since 1971, from seven locations across the northern front range including Brighton, Dacono, Denver, Hudson, Westminster and Strasburg, Colorado. 
"The O'Dell family has built a remarkable family-owned bank that has served their customers and their communities well," said Aaron P. Graft, Vice Chairman and CEO of Triumph Bancorp, Inc. "We look forward to providing the exceptional service their customers expect, while expanding the product offerings available to them.  We are also excited to increase our presence in Colorado to 32 full service banking locations through this acquisition."    
"When we met with Triumph, I knew right away that this was the perfect fit," said James J. O'Dell, Valley Bancorp, Inc. Chairman of the Board. "Our cultures of values, service, and philanthropy are in line with each other. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.  Most importantly, I want to thank our customers, especially those that have stayed with us for many decades, even through the difficult times.  Triumph is committed to providing the same personal service we have always tried so hard to deliver to our customers."
Simultaneously with the closing of the transaction, Valley Bank & Trust will be merged into TBK Bank, SSB, with the resulting institution operating under the TBK Bank brand name.
The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval of the definitive agreement by Valley Bancorp, Inc.'s shareholders. Shareholders that beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 89% of the outstanding voting shares of Valley have entered into an agreement to vote in favor of the transaction.  The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Triumph Bancorp, Inc. was advised in this transaction by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as legal counsel.  Shapiro Bieging Barber Otteson LLP acted as legal counsel and GLC Advisors & Co., LLC acted as financial adviser to Valley Bancorp, Inc.
Aaron P. Graft, Vice Chairman and CEO, and Bryce Fowler, CFO, of Triumph, will host a conference call for investors and analysts, to discuss the transaction details, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Central Time on Thursday, July 27, 2017.

Triumph Bancorp, Inc. To Acquire Valley Bancorp, Inc.






GlobeNewswire



Jul 26, 2017 4:01 PM EDT













 




























































 DALLAS, July 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Triumph Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:TBK) (the "Company") today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Valley Bancorp, Inc., parent of Valley Bank & Trust, headquartered in Brighton, Colorado. Valley Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company with $314 million in total assets as of June 30, 2017. Its community banking subsidiary, Valley Bank & Trust, is an independent, family-owned Colorado bank serving individuals and business customers since 1971, from seven locations across the northern front range including Brighton, Dacono, Denver, Hudson, Westminster and Strasburg, Colorado.  "The O'Dell family has built a remarkable family-owned bank that has served their customers and their communities well," said Aaron P. Graft, Vice Chairman and CEO of Triumph Bancorp, Inc. "We look forward to providing the exceptional service their customers expect, while expanding the product offerings available to them.  We are also excited to increase our presence in Colorado to 32 full service banking locations through this acquisition."     "When we met with Triumph, I knew right away that this was the perfect fit," said James J. O'Dell, Valley Bancorp, Inc. Chairman of the Board. "Our cultures of values, service, and philanthropy are in line with each other. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.  Most importantly, I want to thank our customers, especially those that have stayed with us for many decades, even through the difficult times.  Triumph is committed to providing the same personal service we have always tried so hard to deliver to our customers." Simultaneously with the closing of the transaction, Valley Bank & Trust will be merged into TBK Bank, SSB, with the resulting institution operating under the TBK Bank brand name. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval of the definitive agreement by Valley Bancorp, Inc.'s shareholders. Shareholders that beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 89% of the outstanding voting shares of Valley have entered into an agreement to vote in favor of the transaction.  The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2017.

A reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included as a table in the press release. The information in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall be considered furnished for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and shall not be deemed “filed” for any purpose.
Item 2.02.Regulation FD Disclosure

The information in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.2, shall be considered furnished for purposes of the Exchange Act and shall not be deemed “filed” for any purpose.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, predictions, forecasts, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “could,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “likely,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “projects,” “estimates” or “anticipates” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases that are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: our limited operating history as an integrated company; business and economic conditions generally and in the bank and non-bank financial services industries, nationally and within our local market area; our ability to mitigate our risk exposures; our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends; risks related to the integration of acquired businesses (including our pending acquisition of nine branches from Independent Bank in Colorado) and any future acquisitions; changes in management personnel; interest rate risk; concentration of our factoring services in the transportation industry; credit risk associated with our loan portfolio; lack of seasoning in our loan portfolio; deteriorating asset quality and higher loan charge-offs; time and effort necessary to resolve nonperforming assets; inaccuracy of the assumptions and estimates we make in establishing reserves for probable loan losses and other estimates; lack of liquidity; fluctuations in the fair value and liquidity of the securities we hold for sale; impairment of investment securities, goodwill, other intangible assets or deferred tax assets; our risk management strategies; environmental liability associated with our lending activities; increased competition in the bank and non-bank financial services industries, nationally, regionally or locally, which may adversely affect pricing and terms; the accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures; material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; system failures or failures to prevent breaches of our network security; the institution and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings against us or to which we become subject; changes in carry-forwards of net operating losses; changes in federal tax law or policy; the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes, including changes in banking, securities and tax laws and regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and their application by our regulators; governmental monetary and fiscal policies; changes in the scope and cost of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance and other coverages; failure to receive regulatory approval for future acquisitions; increases in our capital requirements; and risk retention requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act. 
While forward-looking statements reflect our good-faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. All forward-looking statements are necessarily only estimates of future results. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or contemplated by the particular forward-looking statement, and, therefore, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law. For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see “Risk Factors” and the forward-looking statement disclosure contained in Triumph’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February17, 2017 and in Triumph’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 26, 2017.

D Value | F Growth | A Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History & Values | Triumph Bancorp, Inc.

Triumph’s vision is to be the most valuable company in the financial industry. To be valuable is to make a lasting and positive impact on all that we touch and do by:

Investing in the development and success of our team members,
Meeting the financial needs of our customers,
Making profits for our shareholders,
Managing risk through cycles, and
Improving the world around us.











How TRIUMPH Spells Success


Be Transparent

Communicate the truth consistently, directly and professionally. Open communication is the foundation of strong relationships


Respect Others

Treat others as you want to be treated. Put the needs of others and the needs of the team before promoting your own agenda.


Invest for the Future

Do not allow the immediate to crowd out the important. Success that endures is built upon a long-term perspective.


Unique is Good

Beware of following the crowd. Being unique can be difficult, but if it were easy, everyone would do it.


The Mission is More than Money

Make everything you are involved with better. This includes doing good works in the areas of the greatest need – in your community and around the world.


People Make the Difference

In any situation, the most important criteria for our success are the quality of our people and the quality of their thinking.


Be Humble

Model humility in all that you do. Humility is not passivity, as it requires the courage to prefer the needs of others over your own.

DALLAS, July  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Triumph Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:TBK) (the “Company”) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Valley Bancorp, Inc., parent of Valley Bank & Trust, headquartered in Brighton, Colorado. Valley Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company with $314 million in total assets as of June 30, 2017. Its community banking subsidiary, Valley Bank & Trust, is an independent, family-owned Colorado bank serving individuals and business customers since 1971, from seven locations across the northern front range including Brighton, Dacono, Denver, Hudson, Westminster and Strasburg, Colorado.  “The O’Dell family has built a remarkable family-owned bank that has served their customers and their communities well,” said Aaron P. Graft, Vice Chairman and CEO of Triumph Bancorp, Inc. “We look forward to providing the exceptional service their customers expect, while expanding the product offerings available to them.  We are also excited to increase our presence in Colorado to 32 full service banking locations through this acquisition.”     “When we met with Triumph, I knew right away that this was the perfect fit,” said James J. O’Dell, Valley Bancorp, Inc. Chairman of the Board. “Our cultures of values, service, and philanthropy are in line with each other. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.  Most importantly, I want to thank our customers, especially those that have stayed with us for many decades, even through the difficult times.  Triumph is committed to providing the same personal service we have always tried so hard to deliver to our customers.” Simultaneously with the closing of the transaction, Valley Bank & Trust will be merged into TBK Bank, SSB, with the resulting institution operating under the TBK Bank brand name. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval of the definitive agreement by Valley Bancorp, Inc.'s shareholders. Shareholders that beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 89% of the outstanding voting shares of Valley have entered into an agreement to vote in favor of the transaction.  The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2017.  Triumph Bancorp, Inc. was advised in this transaction by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as legal counsel.  Shapiro Bieging Barber Otteson LLP acted as legal counsel and GLC Advisors & Co., LLC acted as financial adviser to Valley Bancorp, Inc. Aaron P. Graft, Vice Chairman and CEO, and Bryce Fowler, CFO, of Triumph, will host a conference call for investors and analysts, to discuss the transaction details, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Central Time on Thursday, July 27, 2017.   To participate in the live conference call, please dial 1-855-940-9472 (Canada: 1-855-669-9657) and request to be joined into the Triumph Bancorp, Inc. call.  A simultaneous audio-only webcast may be accessed via the Company's website at www.triumphbancorp.com through the Investor Relations, News & Events, Webcasts and Presentations links, or through a direct link here at: http://services.choruscall.com/links/tbk170727.html.  An archive of this webcast will subsequently be available at this same location on the Company’s website.

Continual focus on 

 

At Triumph, we keep our focus on bringing value to our customers, team members and shareholders, and - together - we all triumph.  







The Bank You Know 

TBK Bank is dedicated to building lasting relationships in the communities we serve by delivering top-of-the-line banking solutions and creating a better banking experience. 

 







Focused on our communities’ success 

 

There’s a reason “community” is our middle name – we value seeing our communities prosper. Triumph Community Bank is here to help individuals, families and businesses get ahead, because we believe we're all better together.  







Valuable alternative financing solutions 

 

Traditional sources of business financing are tightening up if not disappearing entirely. Triumph Commercial Finance finds the right financing to match the specific needs of small- and medium-sized businesses. 







Financial health means better patient care 

 

Short-term cash flow can often inhibit long-term growth and success, distracting you from what’s most important – the well-being of your patients. Triumph Healthcare Finance helps devise an affordable working capital solution, so you can maintain your focus on providing the best care. 







Premium in more ways than one 

 

We know that paying entire insurance premiums upfront is a hurdle many businesses can’t overcome. Triumph Premium Finance helps insurance agents and their insureds by creating payment plans for premiums, paving the way for businesses to afford to be insured and for agencies to be successful. 







A deciding factor in your success 

Often, business success brings on limitations as the potential for growth outstrips the cash flow that can fuel it. Talk to Triumph Business Capital about how invoice factoring could drive your company's success.  

 







Protecting your business assets 

Triumph Insurance Group is focused on protecting your business assets with customized insurance coverage that fits your needs. From transportation insurance to agribusiness, we understand the importance of insuring business assets, whether that be equipment or land, that help our customers earn a living. 

 





 



 

















































Focused on delivering value
At Triumph Bancorp, we are focused on delivering value to our customers, team members, and shareholders. Value is a rich word — by it we mean that we make things better. Better for our customers, better for our team members, better for our investors, and better for our communities. This is our measure of success.
