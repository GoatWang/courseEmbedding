Clarion Capital Partners Completes Acquisition of Madison Logic
New York, December 1, 2016 - Clarion Capital Partners, LLC today announced that it has completed its acquisition of Madison Logic Inc., the global leader in Account Based Marketing. The existing shareholders of Madison Logic including CEO Tom O'Regan and Co-Founders Vin Turk and Chairman Erik Matlick, will maintain an ownership stake in Madison Logic and continue to build the business in partnership with Clarion.
This partnership enables Madison Logic to invest further in its Activate ABM™ platform, pushing the company's already robust data-driven product development efforts across multiple new verticals. The company will also invest in new geographic regions, expand its personnel base, and seek to make strategic acquisitions.
Mr. O'Regan will remain Madison Logic's CEO, directing the company's long-term strategy as well as managing day-to-day operations. The terms of the transaction, which closed on November 30, were not disclosed.
"Madison Logic has an exceptional management team and is highly respected within the media industry," said David Ragins, Managing Director with Clarion Capital Partners. "We are in a media landscape where B2B marketers require clear ROI from their marketing solutions. Madison Logic is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this transformation thanks to its exceptional data-driven account based marketing products and industry leadership position."
"This transaction is a direct response to the industry's growing demand for an account based strategy that produces real results," said Mr. O'Regan. "With this partnership, we will accelerate our growth by enhancing our current offerings to meet the needs of our growing customer base. We'll introduce our offerings into new industry verticals and we'll expand geographically to better serve our clients and the changing landscape of the media industry as a whole."
"Clarion's long term growth investment approach is a great match for the opportunity that lies ahead of Madison Logic and exactly what the company needs to extend its leadership position," said Madison Logic Chairman, Erik Matlick. "With the experience and resources of Clarion, we will continue to scale the business worldwide with the innovative products for B2B marketers. I am honored to have a world-class investment team working with Madison Logic on this next phase of its growth."
"Madison Logic has the potential for tremendous organic growth and is a solid platform on which to build through strategic acquisitions," said Mr. Ragins. "Clarion is excited to participate in this growth, fueling an already growing company with the resources and experience that will help it evaluate potential partnerships and acquisitions that offer value to Madison Logic's customers."
Petsky Prunier, led by Seth Rosenfield and John Prunier, served as exclusive financial advisor to Madison Logic in this transaction.

Investment Management | Wealth Management | Madison Investments

































































Disciplined investment strategies crafted to pursue superior risk-adjusted returns through full market cycles.




01








Madison has been an independent, employee-owned firm since 1974, freedom that has helped us hone a distinct style of active management.


We seek to avoid the undue risks of reaching for short-term results by emphasizing restraint and focusing on valuation through full market cycles.
- Our Investment Teams
















02

Madison manages approximately $16 billion* in assets for a broad spectrum of clients, including institutions and individuals whose financial landscape involves taxes, funding and regulations.
- Wealth Management












03

Our separately managed accounts and investment solutions are complemented by a roster of actively managed mutual funds. These high-conviction, high active share funds provide investors with exposure to segments of the fixed income and equity markets that differentiates from passive index funds.
- Madison Funds






We look to build trust by maintaining our conservative investment philosophy. When uncertainty strikes, we seek consistency in what we know rather than reacting to what others feel.









We work diligently to ensure our products and people uphold the integrity on which Madison was founded.


Madison’s 100% employee-ownership cultivates a culture of clarity: we want each shareholder to know the goals of our portfolios and why we make each investment. 
We believe that our portfolio managers' goals should align with those of long-term investors. That is why our portfolio managers have meaningful personal capital committed to their own strategies, and senior staff have a significant portion of their own net-worth invested in portfolios managed by Madison.

Fund your account within 45 days with funds originating outside Bank of America and MLPF&S. Funds cannot originate from 401(k) accounts administered by MLPF&S.
For purposes of this offer, qualifying balances are calculated by adding total incoming assets or transfers (including cash, securities and/or margin debit balance transfers) from external accounts, and subtracting assets withdrawn or transferred out of the account within the 90-day holding period.
Assets of $20,000 to $49,999 in cash and/or securities receive $100; for $50,000-$99,999 receive $150; for $100,000-$199,999 receive $250; for $200,000 or more receive $600. You must have the qualifying balance 90 days after funding.
Your one-time cash reward will be deposited into your IRA or CMA within two weeks after you meet qualifying criteria.

If your new account is a Merrill Edge self-directed IRA or CMA account, you also qualify for the following benefits:

Commission-free trades begin within 5 business days of account opening and must be used within 90 calendar days; up to 300 trades per account. Commission-free trades are only applicable in the new self directed account and are limited to online equity and ETF trades. Brokerage fees associated with, but not limited to, margin transactions, option trading, special stock registration/gifting, account transfer and processing, research request and termination apply. Trades are not transferable and are not available for Merrill Edge Advisory Center accounts or other Merrill Lynch Wealth Management accounts. Merrill Edge does not, and this offer is not meant to, promote day trading or solicit engagement in day trading activities. Day trading can be extremely risky. Investors are solely responsible for their own investment decisions, and should research any investment strategy carefully before investing.
Merrill Edge MarketPro Trial begins within 5 business days of opening your self-directed account and expires after 90 calendar days. To learn about additional ways to qualify for Merrill Edge MarketPro, see merrilledge.com/marketpro. Not available for employees of Bank of America or Merrill Lynch and business accounts.

In addition, Merrill Lynch may issue an Internal Revenue Service Form 1099 (or other appropriate form) to you that reflects the value of this reward. Please consult your tax advisor, as Bank of America Corporation and its affiliates and associates do not provide tax advice.
			
			This offer may not be used as an inducement to sell any kind of insurance, including life insurance or annuities.
			
			Banking products are provided by Bank of America, N.A., member FDIC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.
