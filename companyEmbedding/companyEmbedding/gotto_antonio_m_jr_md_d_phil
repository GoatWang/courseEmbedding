An Interview with Antonio M. Gotto, Jr., M.D., D.Phil., Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean and Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College


Editors’ Note
Antonio Gotto is also the Provost for Medical Affairs for Cornell University. He spent over two decades at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, where he was the Bob and Vivian Smith Professor and Chairman of the Albert B. and Margaret M. Alkek Department of Medicine, and the Chief of the Internal Medicine Service at The Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas. During that time, he also held the J.S. Abercrombie Professor Chair for Atherosclerosis and Lipoprotein Research and was the Scientific Director of The DeBakey Heart Center at Baylor. Gotto received his B.A. magna cum laude (biochemistry) in 1957 from Vanderbilt University, his D.Phil. (biochemistry) in 1961 from the University of Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar, and his M.D. in 1965 from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. His residency training was at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Gotto has served as National President of the American Heart Association and is a member of the Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. He has received honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Bologna and Abilene Christian University and honorary professorships from the University of Buenos Aires and Francisco Marroquin University (Guatemala). Gotto is co-author of a series of books that explain the origins and treatment of cardiovascular disease to the general public.
Organization Brief
Founded in 1898, and affiliated with what is now NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital since 1927, Weill Cornell Medical College (weill.cornell.edu) is among the top-ranked clinical and medical research centers in the country, and is divided into 24 basic science and patient care departments that focus on the sciences underlying clinical medicine and/or encompass the study, treatment, and prevention of human diseases. Weill Cornell Medical College is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education of the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Weill Cornell Medical College has grown over the past 24 months. Coming out of the economic downturn, how is it positioned for the future?
In 1998, we had a $300-million fund-raising campaign going, but it wasn’t going very well and we had not raised much money.
In April of 1998, the President of the university and I approached the Weills and asked them to allow us to rename the medical school, and they agreed to it. They gave a $100-million gift and this helped kick off this initial campaign, which we finished by 2000.
Just after 9/11, we kicked off another campaign. The first campaign was for basic science and the second one was for the clinical academic enterprise. The Weills gave another $100 million and Hank Greenberg and the Starr Foundation gave $50 million.
Some people thought such large gifts would discourage others from giving, but it’s just the opposite; it is an incentive to others to give.
Our board and donor base has been very supportive, and when they see things happening at the medical college that they like and they see that the board leaders of the medical college continue to give, this encourages others to give.
So when Sandy and Joan decided in our current third campaign to accelerate their gift at the request of the university, it had a positive effect and was a stimulus to our other donors to respond.
What is it about the culture of the medical center that has made it so cutting-edge and how do you drive continual innovation?
One factor is having imaginative and innovative educators, physicians, and clinicians who are willing to explore new things.
In 1996 and 1997, the medical school and educators undertook a new curriculum. In 2002, with the support of our board of overseers and the administration of the university in Ithaca, we undertook an experiment to try to reproduce our education program 7,600 miles away in Doha, Qatar.
This took a willingness to experiment and try something new. Dr. Dan Alonso agreed to go to Doha and be our first Dean at our branch in Qatar. We wanted to see if we could replicate what we had tested and proven in New York City in a Muslim society.
Is it important to provide a consistent culture between the facilities in New York and Doha?
We’re a culturally sensitive medical school and we respect everyone’s ethnic views. But there is no discrimination in the basic methods of operating. The students in Doha have to meet the same criteria as the students in New York in order to get admitted to the medical college, they are interviewed by the admission committee in New York, and they have basically the same curriculum. In order to graduate and receive their M.D. degree from Cornell University, they have to meet the same level of requirements as a student in New York.
Is the same level of talent still interested in a career in medicine?
We have seen no decline in either the quality or the number of applicants. We interview approximately 5,500 applicants for 101 spots. The most recent class we admitted has the second highest GPAs and the second highest MCATs in the history of the medical school.
The students have an interest in the application of medicine to society and our students are attracted by global medicine.
About half of our students take an elective overseas during their four years. We are affiliated with and support an AIDS/HIV and Tuberculosis clinic in Haiti; our branch in Qatar is the only American medical school to give an M.D. in a foreign country; and we have helped start a medical school in Mwanza, Tanzania.
Our students go to these places and realize why they went into medicine and, in Third World countries, they rely heavily on their powers of observation and on making deductions from the information they gather, because the lab tests might not come back for two or three weeks.
How has the educational component changed from years past?
In education, we now see a movement towards translational research or bench-to-bedside research that aims to bring laboratory findings more quickly to patients. Our goal is to educate our students to be able to adapt to a society and an environment where much medical research is going to be directed towards translational research.
Many who go into medicine do so to develop patient relationships, but with so much pressure from the business side today, has some of the relationship with the patient been lost?
No matter how challenging the business aspects are, we as medical educators have to do all we can to preserve the educational aspect and instill the importance in our students of the patient/physician relationship, because it’s the reason for medicine existing as a profession.•

In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
