Robert J. Murray

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Robert J. Murray (b. 1934) was United States Under Secretary of the Navy in 1980-81.
Biography[edit]
Robert J. Murray was born on August 30, 1934 in Marlborough, Massachusetts. He was educated at Suffolk University, receiving a B.S. in 1961. He then attended Harvard University, receiving an M.P.A. in 1966.
Upon graduation, Murray joined the United States Foreign Service and was posted as a political attaché at the Embassy of the United States in London from 1966 to 1972.
In 1973, he was appointed Assistant to the United States Secretary of Defense and the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, serving under Elliot Richardson and later James R. Schlesinger. In 1975, President of the United States Richard Nixon appointed Nixon as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower and Reserve Affairs), a post he held until 1976. During his time at the United States Department of Defense, Murray worked on implementing a new NATO strategy; transitioning the United States Armed Forces following the ending of the Vietnam War; and the transition of the United States Armed Forces to a volunteer military.
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter appointed Murray as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs). During this period, he participated in Carter's negotiation of the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt.
President Carter nominated Murray as Under Secretary of the Navy on January 17, 1980. He was sworn in on February 7, 1980 and served as Under Secretary until September 29, 1981.
Following his stint as Under Secretary, Murray moved from public service to academia. He first joined the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island as Dean and Director of the College's Advanced Research Center and creator/director of the Strategic Studies Group. In 1983, he became a member of the faculty of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University as director of the School's national security program. Murray retired from teaching in 1990.
After his retirement from teaching, Murray served as president and chief executive officer of CNA.

On the show I discussed the failure of conventional medicine to address the underlying issues in many health conditions offering little more than drugs as biochemical “band aids.”

  Weekly Health Tip
 Mind Your Ps and Qs
 PQQ may be the perfect answer to preventing or reversing age-related mental decline.
kiwiPQQ (short for pyrroloquinoline quinone) is a vitamin-like compound found in plant foods that shows a wide range of benefits for brain function and energy production. Learn more about PQQ with the following Q&A.
What Exactly Does PQQ Do?
PQQ is an extremely potent antioxidant that is able to carry out the role of an antioxidant in the body more than 20,000 times—which is a rare thing. For example, other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, are only able to accomplish this “cycling” process about four times.
Are There Any Food Sources of PQQ?
PQQ has been found in all plant foods analyzed to date. Particularly PPQ-rich foods include parsley, green peppers, kiwi, papaya, and tofu. These foods contain 2–3 mcg of PQQ per 100 grams. Green tea provides about the same amount per 4-oz. serving. While these amounts appear to be sufficient in helping our cells carry out their basic functions, research indicates that boosting PQQ through supplementation can produce some amazing effects.

  Featured Condition
June is National “Cataract Awareness Month”
According to a great deal of scientific research, the leading cause of impaired vision and blindness in the United States is an entirely preventable condition. Cataracts are white, opaque blemishes on the normally transparent lens of the eye. They occur as a result of damage to the protein structure of the lens, similar to the damage that occurs to the protein of eggs when they are boiled or fried. As a result, cataracts can make it difficult to see. Approximately six million people have some degree of vision-impairing cataract and among U.S. Medicare recipients, cataract surgery is the most common major surgical procedure with nearly one million procedures each year.
The lens of the eye is, obviously, a vital component of the visual system owing to its ability to focus light (via changes in shape) while maintaining optical transparency. Unfortunately, this transparency diminishes with age. The majority of the geriatric population displays some degree of cataract formation. Even with normal aging there is a progressive increase in size, weight, and density of the lens, but cataracts are not necessarily an inevitable occurrence with aging.
The basic cause of a cataract occurs when the normal protective mechanisms are unable to prevent free radical damage. The lens, like many other tissues of the body, depends on adequate levels and activities of antioxidant enzymes and adequate levels of antioxidants such as lutein, vitamins E and C and selenium, to aid in prevention of damage by free radicals. When the lens is sufficiently damages normal homeostatic control of cellular functions are lost and the cell dies causing the protein.
Individuals with higher dietary intakes of vitamin C and E, selenium, and carotenes (especially lutein) have a much lower risk for development of cataracts. Several studies have shown that various nutritional supplements—multiple vitamin formulas, vitamins C and E, B vitamins (especially B12 and folic acid), and vitamin A—also offer significant protection against cataracts. Studies conducted by the Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research Group (AREDS) and others indicate that a combination of these nutrients will likely produce better results than any single nutrient alone or even limited combinations of 3 or less nutrients both in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.
For more information go to "What are Cataracts?"
