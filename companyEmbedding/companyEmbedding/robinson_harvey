                                Report abuseTranscript of Harvey Miguel RobinsonChildhood:He was 18 years old at the time making him one of the youngest serial killers in history.Robinson is suspected to have committed several other murders but they have not been confirmed. Miguel committed three murders spanning from 1992-1993. Robinson entered the juvenile system for the first time at the age of nine when he was caught shoplifting.  He continued committing petty crimes throughout his youth.It was not until 1989 that he was sent to a residential reform program after being convicted of assault. Robinson's teachers saw hope for him in the future due to his high scores on intelligence tests. VictimsSigns of PsychopathySocialSOCIALHarvey Miguel RobinsonRobinson's MurdersDenise Sam-CaliThe TrialMotivationConvicted murderer and rapistBorn December 6, 1974Allentown, PennsylvaniaFather-Son RelationshipRobinson's father, Harvey Miguel Robinson Sr., was said to be an abusive husband and a drunk by friends and family. Despite his violent nature, the younger Robinson worshiped his father.In 1963 Robinson's father was convicted of voluntary manslaughter after beating his mistress to death with a blunt object. Even though his father was convicted of murder, the elder Robinson was his son's idol.  He raped a total of four women during this time, but only killed three of them. The fourth escaped.Joan BurghardtKilled August 199229 year old nurse's aidCharlotte SchmoyerKilled June 199315 year old newspaper carrierJessica Jean FortneyKilled July 199347 year old grandmotherOut of the four known victims, Denise is the only one who survived the attack. Harvey raped and beat her with the intention to kill her, but she managed to escape.Robinson returned to her home several nights later in order to successfully kill her.The police predicted his behavior and were stationed at the home when Harvey arrived. After having a shoot out with the police, Harvey jumped through a window to escape.Police caught him after he went to a local hospital for treatment. Robinson's trial was short, lasting only 14 days.At the time of the trial and his eventual conviction, Robinson was 19 years old.He was found guilty on three counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.Robinson did not testify in his own trial.He told his lawyers throughout the trial that he had not committed the murders despite the overwhelming amount of evidence against him.Robinson remains on death row today. Psychological EvaluationsAnalysis of childhood:Even though Robinson was a troubled child, the juvenile system did everything "right" to help him turn his life around.The dramatic escalation of Robinson's crimes puzzled many psychologists who did not think he was capable of committing such heinous crimes.Nature vs. Nurture :Psychologists analyzing Robinson's childhood debate the effect of Robinson's father being a murderer on him becoming a murderer himself. Most believe that by idolizing his father, Robinson was more likely to accept and commit murder. There are parallels between the murders of both Robinsons, but distinct differences as well. Other psychologists believe that Robinson was born psychotic. These psychologists are the minority. Psychological EvaluationsAnalysis After Arrest:After evaluating Robinson while he was in jail, psychologists concluded that he suffers from an anti-social personality disorder.This disorder includes auditory and visionary hallucinations. They also found that he had trouble adapting to the norms of society.For example, he had difficulty listening to authority figures and following rules. Anger Retaliatory: Robinson was very impulsive in areas that are self destructive.He abused drugs and alcohol. He displayed frequent displays of uncontrolled anger.While in reform school, one of his teachers felt threatened by him so she asked a social worker to watch him during her class.Robinson ended up attacking the social worker one day during class confirming the teachers fears.Robinson's murders displayed an excessive and brutal level of force.He killed two of his victims by beating them to death.The third victim was stabbed over 20 times. Robinson's rapes were violent and extended the physical attack on all four of his victims, including the survivor.The rapes were painful and brutal. Robinson's attacks were planned with detail before he committed them.He stalked his victims prior to the attack, studying their schedules.He broke into his victims homes based on his observations. Robinson was linked to other crimes by physical evidence.Robinson was linked to crimes such as robbery and assault from the age of nine. Robinson never showed that he thought of the consequences of his actions. Raping and killing three women results in serious consequences that Robinson did not think about.He returned to his fourth victim's home even though he knew it was incredibly risky. Is Robinson a Psychopath?Robinson's behavioraligns with very few of the signs of psychopathy leading to the conclusions that he is not a psychopath. He was most likely led to commit such horrific crimes by his father's own murder and poor home life. Harvey Miguel RobinsonRobinson's crimes were most likely linked to his father's poor parenting and murder sentence. He did not show signs of psychopathy, but rather rage as seen in his motivation. Forensic psychologists were able to account for the various factors of Robinson's early life when diagnosing him with anti-social personality order. While investigators technically proved Robinson was a serial killer, forensic psychologists were able to help them confirm their suspicions and also explain why he committed such disturbing crimes.
