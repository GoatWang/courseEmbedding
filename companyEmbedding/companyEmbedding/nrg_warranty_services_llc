Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        NRG Home Services, LLC has received 4.96 out of 5 stars based on 37 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

GHOSTEK LIMITED WARRANTY
Ghostek LLC and its affiliates (“Ghostek”) warrants our products against defects in material or workmanship for a period of one year from the original date of purchase of the product by a consumer (the “Warranty Period”).

For purposes of this limited warranty, “refurbished” means a product or part that has been substantially returned to its original specifications. In the event of a defect, these are your exclusive remedies. Ghostek reserves the right to charge a small shipping and handling fee in connection with the fulfillment of any valid claim.
 
GHOSTEK LIFETIME WARRANTY
Ghostek offers a limited lifetime warranty for all Ghostek cases and screen protectors excluding glass screen protectors. This warranty is only valid for cases and screen protectors that are considered defects. Defect is defined as an imperfection or flaw that is produced by a manufacturing error. Accidental drops, installation failures, etc. caused by the owner are not covered under this warranty. 
 
EXCLUSIONS & LIMITATIONS
Except for the warranty expressly set forth above or to the extent restricted or prohibited by applicable law, Ghostek expressly disclaims any and all other warranties express or implied, including any warranty of quality, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose, and you specifically agree that Ghostek shall not be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, punitive, or consequential damages for breach of any warranty of any type on any Ghostek product. In addition to and without limiting the generality of the foregoing disclaimers, the limited warranty does not, under any circumstances, cover the replacement or cost of any electronic device or personal property inside or outside of the Ghostek product.

John Barnard - DE  - 2017-07-25



2017-07-25
										
										Our new home sprung a leak and we had to contact AHS customer service. The request for service was easily entered on line. Receivd rapid Email notification of the referral that was made, and an update on time. Got a response by very early the next morning. Shamiyah with AHS customer Service answered all our questions and gave us peace of mind that repairs were in the works. Easy squeezy. The plumber arrived exactly when they said they would, fixed the problem  with care and easy to understand explanations! Thank you AHS. It was a pleasure and a comfort knowing that there is someone to help when the unexpected happens. 
									



Janice Agin - TX  - 2017-07-25



2017-07-25
										
										Our technician was very helpful and found the problem immediately.  The company was very timely in their response to our needs.  I would recommend them to anyone.
									



Ruben Arriaga - TX  - 2017-07-25



2017-07-25
										
										The last call for my ac went absolutely flawless.  The updates were very timely.  They showed up quickly.  The AC company could not have been better.  I was very impressed.  Thank you.
									



Jeff Jordan - FL  - 2017-07-25



2017-07-25
										
										I\'ve always purchased a Home Warranty when buying a home. Just never know what condition appliances and AC are really in. I\'ve only had to use it a few times but it was well worth it. Each time I had to use... the CSR were very knowledgeable and very helpful in walking us thru the process. They didn\'t hide anything. As a Realtor and homeowner, I have always recommended new buyers to purchase a Home Warranty. It\'s worth the cost per year to protect against big losses at one time. 
									



Brent Stone - TX  - 2017-07-25



2017-07-25
										
										Had a service call on my A/C unit. Replaced a capacitor. Didn\'t fix the cooling issue. Needed to come back and install the entire unit in attic. Cost me $1,190.00 out of pocket. 
Did an excellent job in the install, just took three weeks with temps in upper 90\'s.

										I have had to use this warranty more times than I would have ever suspected. As one user stated, in the case of an AC issue...waiting for parts or the service man to contact you can seem like an eternity. Once they arrived, they called and ordered the parts and had them FedEx express overnighted. He was there first thing in the morning, sitting outside in his truck waiting for the FedEx delivery to arrive. Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with First American Warranty. Once I even looked at other warranty companies prior to renewing just to see if I could save some money, but bang for the buck....repairs, and appliances that that First American Warranty covers by default tend to be a premium upgrade with all of the other warranty companies. Unfortunately, my copay has gone up slightly every year, and I assume that is because I have actually used this warranty, but it is still a lot cheaper than paying for the complete cost out of my own pocket.

										First time buyer of this type of insurance.  Moved into a house that has a pool that sprang a new leak in the pool filter.  Luckily it was covered by the policy.

										Great service for me. I\'ve called First American before and have not had any problems. This time had A/C problems. The technician diagnosed the problem very quickly, after I explained what it was doing. My A/C unit was repaired in 20 minutes -bad capacitor. I did have one small beef to say that it did take a week to get out to the job. But maybe that\'s probably due to few tech\'s for their area. Maybe they could refer to another service co. as a backup. Thankfully we had a window unit to help keep the humidity down while we waited.

										hearing a salesperson tell you something and then actually experiencing it really confirms to me this companies commitment to its customers. When I purchased this home warranty the salesperson I spoke to told me that they get service to you in 24 hours on average however some cases it can take 48 hours but that is the norm. So last Monday when I placed a claim on my AC at around 8am and a serviceman shows up at my house at 3pm i really felt the level of service. Finally a salesperson tells you something and a company really backs it up!

										They have been there for me and my tenants in every way. We have 3 homes we own other than our own home and we depend on this warranty whenever something breaks down in any of our homes those of us who have tenants know its not easy owning a house in another state and having tenants so the warranty is a important factor in owning a house for me and the service from this warranty is absolutely  the best i have ever had. They respond fast get things working fast my tenants are very happy and I\'am very happy.

										My fridge stopped working so i called HSC to make a claim. It was great the lady in customer service was very professional and made sure to get a service repair guy out to my house the next morning I explained her that we really need to get our fridge back up its a priority in our house as it is in every home. Sure enough at 10am the next morning there was a serviceman in my home working on my fridge. Two hours later my fridge was working like new.

										Last night when I got home from work my garage door would not open, I made a service request online and this morning I got a call from a garage door repair person. He set up a appointment with me and my wife was home only until 11:30 am he said not to worry he will be done by then and he was. He replaced the garage door opener thankfully my wife was not late for work.

										Had my first service call on my A/C unit on hottest week we had in Las Vegas and they got someone out the same day. Was fixed and up and running that evening. Fortunately my repair was done with only the service fee. 
									



Chris - PA  - 2017-07-19

										I received HSA from the seller for free when I purchased a house.  So far I had to call them for a hot water tank issue and furnace issue.  The hot water tank after a couple visits and part replacements eventually got replaced with a bran new one.  The plumber gave great service and was prompt and I had no issues with his service or HSA\'s service.  The furnace was the same way.  It ended up being an easy fix but still the service was great on by both HSA and the repair tech.  Even if I would have paid for the HSA warranty it would have paid for itself in a few months.  I definitely recommend it for anyone buying a new house.  As for someone who is really handy or has been in their house for a while it really depends on the shape of your appliances.  The warranty is a little pricey to have everything properly covered but  it definitely helps when something unexpected happens,

										I have had nothing but the best experience with our HSA home warranty.  Buying a home is stressful enough, but having the peace of mind knowing that problems can be fixed is priceless!!

Yes, customer service can be tough to get on the phone.  It is very frustrating, but once on the phone they are professional, and very easy to deal with.  They are also very responsive in giving updates on repairs once in progress.

The website portal to start a repair is effortless, and is the easiest way to go.

We have never had an issue getting our repairs completed, or having competent individuals complete the work.  In today\'s world everyone wants their issues fixed instantaneously, but the reality is sometimes it takes time.  As long as you are cognizant that things break at the most inopportune time, and you have to take a deep breath and go through the process; you will be fine.  All of our service provider have been professional and exception in their repair process.

I will continue to renew our policy for as long as HSA will allow!!

										Our air conditioner quit on a Saturday morning and I called HSA. By Sunday morning I had a call from the vendor and they made an appointment for Tuesday. They  sent the picture of the technician, for safety sake, and called to tell me he was on the way. He came, repaired the Air Conditioner, told me I needed freon, as well, added Freon and left. It was great.

Chelsea Pollard - TX  - 2017-07-18



2017-07-18
										
										Don\'t have many people who cover my area so that\'s been a issue for me personally.  The service from landmark employees has almost always been super pleasant they are very friendly and easy to discuss issues with. 
									



Angus MacMillan - UT  - 2017-07-11



2017-07-11
										
										After having, but never using this warranty for alomst a year, I had a regrigerator and swamp cooler go out in the same week...No problem I thought, I have this home warranty the seller included in the price of the home. Unable to reach anyone by phone or email after many attempts, I finally opened an online service request. The next day I was contacted  by a refrigerator repair company telling me the soonest they could get out was a week from today. That was not acceptable so I tried calling landmark at least 5 times, waiting on hold for ever... opened up a chat window from their website..... which remained inactive for a full 45 minutes, and  sent them emails from both their website and directly with zero response. 

I did not hear from anyone except to receive an email that they had charged my credit card $60 for the fridge repair order. It was not until I threatened to give them a poor review that I got a somehwat personally directed email. To cut a long story short,  I ended up cancelling both service tickets and booked service myself with people coming out in two days vs a week. In both cases the service fees for the onsite calls were less than the $60 deductible from Landmark and both fees would credit against any repair cost.

In closing.... I am not sure that anyone actually works at Landmark other than in their WEB team. I think the company is a shell and like the Wizard of OZ with has a few  short wizards pulling knobs and dials behind a large LANDMARK HOME WARRANTY web curtain.

My advice...put $100 / month in the bank for repairs and forget about buying Landmark home warranty.

										Once I placed the service request I received a call regarding my request within 20 minutes, it was July 4th. The next morning the service technician was out and everything was fixed. Easy questions to answer, great customer service. 
									



Jocelyn Durant - TX  - 2017-06-01

										I have had Landmark since April. I have since had to use them twice, the first to have the house rekeyed and had the most amazing service from Landmark and the service provider. The second service request for was the dishwasher which stopped working which we discovered after closing. Landmark provided excellent customer service throughout this process with prompt follow up, efforts to find and locate parts and contacting the service provider when needed. They were able to solve my challenge with a pay out. I have been extremely satisfied with Landmark Warranty and would highly recommend them to others!
									



Heather - TX  - 2017-05-31

										This is the second home we have warrantied thru Landmark. Our experiences have always been positive. Most of our claims have been appliance repairs (fridge and washing machine). 
Some of the contractors have been better than others but all seemed adequate and several were outstanding. If there have been delays in repairs it is typically because a part had to be ordered or because the issue occurred on the weekend when contractor was not working. You cannot fault the warranty company or even contractor for that! My thought is that if I\'m able to get what would otherwise be an expensive out of pocket repair completed for a minimal charge and a few days wait then I\'m getting what I paid for. I have been pleased with the polite and helpful staff at Landmark when I\'ve placed calls about a service request. If everything continues as it has thus far, I expect to continue doing business with Landmark for years to come.

										They have been excellent for me. They are very courteous and professional. I have dealt with Marc in sales and this nice lady Jasmine in the claims service section. They are always really friendly - even when I have called in all aggravated and flustered that my Air Conditioning stopped working. I got a call from the AC repair man about 90 minutes after I hung up with claims. I thought about giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because the repair man couldn\'t fix the issue on the spot when he came out because he had to order a part - then I thought to myself, that to hold that against them would be pretty unreasonable. So, based on my experience I rate them 5 out 5 stars and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a home warranty company.

										Defintely a very convenient service. I bet you would never find another contractor that responded so quickly when something broke. Getting a warranty plan from 365 Home Warranty is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.

										There was a plumbing emergency at my house and I made a call to 365 Home Warranty’s hotline number as instructed when I need assistance. Someone picked up right away and started the claim for me. A technician came by the next day and fixed everything pretty quickly. Definitely happy with 365.

										The service repair man assigned to my case was extremely professional and very quick to respond. He is the only repair person I have ever had show up early for the repair! I was impressed with his knowledge and the efficiency with which he assessed the issue. I would call him again in the future for sure!

										The owner/technician who attended to my dishwasher and microwave problems was very prompt, courteous and professional.  Definitely knew what he was doing.  Always called if he was going to be a few minutes late and kept in touch regarding when he could get approval, parts, and attend to the problem.  Very satisfied.
									



Donna Tripp - MD  - 2017-07-13

										I am completely satisfied with the service I received from Home Warranty of America.  My hot water heater was leaking, the technician stated that it needed replacement, an estimate was submitted to Home Warranty of America, and the install was complete!  I could not be more satisfied.  I did have to pay a small amount OOP for drip pan and reserve tank to bring it up to code, but it was minimal.  Very happy customer.

Auto Warranty Plans

																								





An auto warranty is an agreement between the owner of the vehicle and a warranty company. The warranty company agrees to pay for repairs, identified in advance, during the specified warranty period. A warranty period is generally based on car mileage; anywhere from one thousand to several tens of thousands of miles. The longer the coverage, the higher the price of the auto warranty. Warranties are often purchased in lump sum amounts, but certain companies also offer monthly payment plans.
Auto warranties are generally considered a wise purchase, since the cost of car repairs can easily exceed thousands of dollars. However, that reasoning only holds true if the auto warranty covers the repairs needed. Auto warranty contracts have a lot of fine print. Understanding the scope of coverage is imperative to making a wise purchase. You also need to make sure the company offering the auto warranty is reputable - a warranty company that goes out of business will not be there to issue auto claim payments. Simply put, not every auto warranty is created equal.

Continued from above
Before agreeing to purchase an auto warranty, you need to be sure to consider the following items:

Repair Coverage. Will the auto warranty plan cover the costly repairs that may be needed?
Cost. How does the cost of one auto warranty company compare to the next? Are you getting what you're paying for?
Reputation. If and when you have an auto repair claim, will the auto warranty company stand behind you and your claim?

TopConsumerReviews.com has reviewed and ranked the best auto warranty plans available today. We hope you find these reviews helpful in finding the best auto warranty that fits your needs!

The Basics of Auto Warranties
Cars are expensive investments, whether you like to purchase new or pre-owned. In protecting that investment and to avoid future repair expenses on your car, you may want to consider purchasing an auto warranty.
Most new and some used cars are covered by some sort of warranty when purchased. For example, new cars are usually covered by a manufacturer's warranty. These warranties vary greatly and are limited in duration. They may cover a variety of repairs until either a time limit or mileage limit such as three years or 36,000 miles. Once you reach that time or mileage limit, the warranty will either totally expire
or much of what it covers will be void.
Some manufacturers also offer various program warranties on specific used or pre-owned cars, usually called "certified used" or something similar, that extend the original manufacturer's warranty or parts of the warranty.
If you plan on keeping the car past the life of the manufacturer's warranty, you may want to consider purchasing an extended warranty. Extended warranties are insurance policies against expensive, unforeseen repairs. In essence, extended warranties are actually service contracts. They cover expenses incurred that your warranty doesn't cover.
Unlike manufacturer's warranties, extended warranties are purchased separately from your car. They can be purchased either through the original manufacturer or through a third-party, independent warranty company. In some cases, you'll receive offers to purchase extended warranties in the mail or over the phone from the manufacturer just as the original manufacturer's warrantee is expiring.
Extended warranties are all different. They each differ on what repairs are covered, how much is covered, duration of the coverage and cost of the warranty. Before purchasing any extended warranty, determine what is still covered on the warranty you possess, determine how long past the life of the warranty you'll keep the car, what you want covered and for how long.
When researching the details of the warranty you want to purchase, look for information on the policy's deductible, whether the policy is transferable if you sell the car and whether repairs can be done anywhere or only with specific shops. Also, look for specifics on what is covered and what is not. For instance, does the warranty cover breakdown of parts as well as wear and tear? A warranty that only
covers
breakdown requires the part to break before the warranty will pay to replace it. A wear and tear policy will cover parts that need to be replaced because they are too worn to work efficiently.
Purchasing an extended warranty can be a smart investment. Don't forget to research the warranty specification and the companies offering them online before making the purchase.

If you're getting an older used car from a dealer, it's a good idea to get an extended warranty to cover any costly issues that might present themselves later. I didn't want to take any chances, so I definitely went with an extended warranty.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
