About Wealthminder



Wealthminder was created for one simple reason:
To help people get the financial assistance they need to achieve their long-term financial goals.


Wealthminder is a database of every Investment Advisor Representative in the country.
We work hard to collect and provide you the information you need to find a financial advisor who’s right for you.


If you are looking for a specific financial advisor and you can’t find them on Wealthminder,
it’s likely that they are either exclusively a broker or are unlicensed - please
contact us
and we’ll try to help!



Finding a Financial Advisor through Wealthminder



Historically finding and hiring a financial advisor was hard.
Wealthminder was built to make the process much easier.


The best way to use Wealthminder is to take advantage of our free proposal system.
All you have to do is take a few minutes of your time to describe your situation and the assistance you are looking for.


Wealthminder then sends your request to our network of
prescreened financial advisors.
If a financial advisor is interested in your business, they will submit a proposal to you.


You review the proposals you receive and decide if you’d like to have a follow-up call with one or more of the financial advisors.


Throughout the process, you maintain control. We only share your contact information with a financial advisor once you ask for an introduction.

Gulf News StoreBuy latest products from our online store SHARESBEAUTYJuly 22, 2017   | Last updated less than one minute ago   -- -°C ----:--Listen LiveJosh FM   How to style your hair like Chris Hemsworth, Channing Tatum and Ryan Gosling Whether you have aspirations of achieving the ultimate slick look like Bradley Cooper, or the rugged style that Tom Hardy makes look so good, celebrity hairstylist Asgar Saboo shares his tips on how to accomplish an A-list hairstyle. Published: 09:27 November 25, 2014 By Asgar Saboo, Special to Gulf News SMALLMEDIUMLARGELong hairWith Chris Hemsworth being voted the sexiest man in the world, it’s no surprise that his long surfer hairstyle would be desired. There is no denying that long hair does a great job at standing out from the crowd, but there are a few important things to do to pull off this hairstyle.My recommendationsTime: In order to succeed with long hair patience is vital. There will come a stage where the hair isn’t long enough to sweep behind the ears and isn’t looking particularly attractive. It can be very tempting to simply give up at this stage, however once this stage passes the hair starts to look far better.Length: One of the best features of this hairstyle is the fact that personal preference plays a huge role in the length of the hair. Celebrities such as Chris Hemsworth and Brad Pitt have the hair trimmed just above the neck; this provides a smart look when needed, while maintaining the ability to keep that surfer style.Style: in order to achieve the casual look, men should allow their long hair to air-dry. This keeps the hair looking healthier and more masculine. Use your fingers to comb the hair. In order to give the hair shape, use wax applied to individual strands of hair. Comb and gel should be reserved for formal occasions. Comb the hair close to the scalp and sweep it behind the ears, this will compliment smart clothing.Extra tips: For those who have feminine features, try growing a beard to match the long hair. Be sure to use an electric trimmer to keep the beard neat and stylish. This adds masculinity whilst avoiding an unwanted messy appearance.  Make sure to wash the hair twice a week using shampoo and conditioner, this will avoid the hair becoming dirty and tangled.Short slick hairShaved back and sides with longer hair on top is one of the most popular trends for men currently, with the likes of Channing Tatum and Ryan Gosling showing how it’s done.Related Links How to style your hair like Aniston, PadukoneHow to style your hair like SRKStyle your hair like Selena, Rihanna or RitaHow to style your hair like a supermodelHow to style your hair like Katrina, Aishwarya My recommendationsCut: Before talking about products and styling, the first step is to ensure the hair is cut in the proper way. Using hair clippers shave the back and sides to the desired length, then blend the sides and back up the textured layers through the top to add height to the style. This will involve regular trims to ensure the sides do not outgrow the top.Products: In order to make the most out of this look, once the hair has been washed, towel dry the top and add hairspray. Once dried, run wax through the hair, starting at the fringe, if necessary; apply wax to the sides and back of the hair. Complete the look by spraying hairspray all over, this will keep the hair in place throughout the day.Extra tips: The best product to use is matt clay; this will avoid making the hair look greasy or shiny and will add softness to the cut. It can also be used to make a "messy" look by ruffling the top of the hair.Curly hair for the red carpetWith curly hair becoming ever more popular, it can be one of the hardest looks to get right. A-Lister Matthew McConaughey has embraced his locks and shown the world how to make curly hair stylish.My recommendationsLength: this is one of the biggest pitfalls for those with curly hair, the main thing to remember is to have the hair cut at a medium-to-long length on top, and shorter on the sides. This will give the locks enough room to have shape, while remaining smart. Remember to have layers cut into the top of the hair to add shape to the overall hair.Products: Add a light gel to wet hair and blow dry it back from the face using a round brush to have a looser, wavy look. For a curly look, simply add a curling gel and leave the hair to dry. Once the hair has dried, use foaming pomade on the hair to improve its shape and separate the locks.Extra tips: Add another dimension to the look by curling individual locks of hair around your finger and shape them with hair product. This will give definition to your locks and will improve its style.About the writerAsgar Saboo is a celebrity hairstylistand the Style Director of theDaniel Galvin Salon in London.Website: www.asgarboo.com  More from Beauty Brazilian Blowout at Be Bar reviewAn edgy haircut with JetSet’s Simone RestaTips & Toes energy healing massage reviewBab Al Shams Relaxed Couple spa reviewWhy SPF primers kill two birds with one stoneLadies spa day at Fairmont Dubai reviewReview: Ahasees Spa at Grand Hyatt DubaiJo Malone: I’ve never given up on life tags from this storyBrad Pittfollow this tag on MGNfiled underGulfNewsLife&StyleGlamourBeautytagsBrad Pittfollow this tag on MGN+ MGNAlso In BeautyBrazilian Blowout at Be Bar review 					Life & Style Gallery It’s a crawling, jolly race in New YorkNeha, Katrina and Jacqueline in celebwatch 					Life & Style	Videos 	PlayTiger Shroff’s a true fan in ‘Munna Michael’Watch: Sanjay Dutt wants to be a photographer  Follow Us Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosGalleries01Manila-based designer opens shop in Dubai02How to wear pastel denim this summer036 favourite lipsticks that work on everyone  	PlayWatch: Sanjay Dutt wants to be a photographerJul 18, 2017	PlayCover controversy, Emmy snubs and moreJul 16, 2017	PlayTiger Shroff’s a true fan in ‘Munna Michael’Jul 19, 2017	PlayJenners in trouble, King of the Khans and moreJul 10, 2017 1ImageIt’s a crawling, jolly race in New YorkJul 16, 2017 14ImagesNeha, Katrina and Jacqueline in celebwatchJul 13, 2017 11ImagesRina Fukushi makes waves on the runwaysOct 23, 2016 1ImageMessi Nuptial: Wedding of the centuryJul 01, 2017SpottedTrendy guy spotted in UAE: Raihan HamidDavid Tusing tabloid!
