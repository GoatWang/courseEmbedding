Steven R. Johnson is an active trial attorney and is admitted to practice in Illinois and several Federal Courts.  Steve has represented clients in a variety of state and federal courts in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Kansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.  Steve’s practice areas include Catastrophic Loss Litigation involving Subrogation and Defense, Insurance Coverage Litigation, Commercial Litigation, Commercial Real Estate Development and Property Leasing, Defending Complex Class Action Claims under the Truth In Lending Act and Consumer Fraud Statutes, as well as some Appellate Practice in these areas.  In addition, Steve has presented industry seminars in fire scene investigation and spoliation.
Steve has tried complex large loss property subrogation cases to verdict and obtained multi-million dollar awards in both state and federal courts throughout the country.  In addition, Steve has successfully settled substantial multi-party litigation matters on behalf of both insurance companies and businesses resulting in multi-million dollar awards without the risks associated with proceeding to trial.  With regard to his defense practice, Steve has represented both large and small businesses confronted with large claims for damages arising out of construction matters, business disputes, class action consumer fraud cases, and insurance coverage disputes.  Over the past twenty-five years, Steve has successfully defended his clients and obtained cost-saving victories through aggressive motion practice, alternative dispute resolution programs, and by going to trial when necessary.  Steve also serves as outside general counsel for a number of businesses in real estate development, automobile dealerships, health care service providers including physicians and nurses, and various construction-related trades.  His litigation background has provided Steve with the experience necessary to assist his business clients in managing their risks through specific modifications to their contracts, through the purchase of specialized insurance products, and the adoption of employee practices and procedures to protect their businesses.  Steve has also assisted his business clients in re-financing debt, renegotiating long-term lease obligations and in the formation of new business entities to meet the needs of growing businesses.
Steve has been licensed to practice in Illinois since 1992 and in the following federal courts:  U.S. District Court Northern District of Illinois, 1992; U.S. District Court Central District of Illinois, 1997; U.S. District Court Northern District of Indiana, 1998; U.S. District Court District of Nebraska, 2000; and U.S. Court of Appeals 8th Circuit, 2002.  Steve’s client base has called upon him to quickly mobilize and respond to matters throughout the Midwest or wherever the need arises.  Whether it is a $20 million property subrogation loss, a complex class action defense or insurance coverage claim, a routine business dispute or the defense of a personal injury action, Steve puts together the right team of lawyers, engineers, and other experts to address the issues in each case efficiently to protect the interests of his clients.
When not working on behalf of the firm and its clients, Steve serves on the Board of Directors for the Student Excellence Foundation, the West Suburban Baseball League, and volunteers his time to a number of civic and other charitable organizations.  He is a life-long resident of Wheaton where he resides with his wife and two children.

Six Month Smiles braces uses tooth-colored (white) brackets and wires. They're barely visible!OrthodonticsTraditional long-term adult orthodontics may take one to two years, or even more in some cases, to straighten all your teeth. Understandably, many adults simply don't want to wear braces for that long. However, traditional braces still have their place.Invisalign OrthodonticsThe Invisalign treatment consists of a series of clear plastic aligners, created precisely to gently and gradually move your teeth into place. By using a series of clear removable aligners, Invisalign straightens your teeth right before your eyes. Change them about every two weeks, and your teeth will move - little by little, week by week - until they have moved to the final position that Dr. Johnson has prescribed for you. Using advanced 3-D Technology, we can predetermine your treatment plan, and show you the results you would achieve, even before you start your treatment.ImplantsDental ImplantsIf you are missing one or more teeth, and wish to eat your favorite foods, increase your chewing ability, and improve your appearance, speech, and self-esteem, then you are a candidate for dental implants. The doctors at Annandale Smiles use the latest implant technology so you can smile again with confidence. Call our office today to schedule your appointment.RestorativeBridgesA dental bridge is a fixed (non-removable) appliance and is an excellent way to replace missing teeth. It can also help to maintain your facial shape, prevent remaining teeth from moving, restore your chewing and speaking ability, and perfect your smile!Restorative DentistryPost-graduation, Dr. Butler moved to the Northern Virginia area where she first started practicing in Leesburg and Lorton. In January 2015, Dr. Butler joined the Annandale Smiles Team. Dr. Butler specializes in restorative dentistry but is always working to learn new procedures and techniques.Dental BondingTooth bonding is a special resin deposit that adheres to your teeth and becomes as strong as your natural enamel. It can solve many cosmetic problems including stained teeth, gapped or chipped teeth, decayed teeth, or misalignment.FillingsResin CompositeThere are several different materials used for dental fillings by dentists in Annandale, VA. Amalgam dental fillings, made up of silver, tin, copper, zinc, and mercury, are more commonly known as silver or mercury fillings. Composite resin dental fillings, made up of very tiny silica pieces surrounded by a plastic resin usually composed of bis-GMA, are most commonly known as white fillings, tooth-colored fillings, and direct veneers.VeneersBonding is a low-cost way to improve your smile. It is great for children who have chipped front teeth and for adults who need an alternative for veneers.CrownsAlthough there are several types of crowns, porcelain (tooth colored, metal free crowns) are the most popular, because they resemble your natural teeth. We want to make your smile as genuine as possible and will not fill your mouth full of metal!EndodonticsRoot Canal TreatmentRoot canal treatment is also known as endodontics. Root canal treatment is required when tooth decay has broken through the outer enamel and infected the heart of the tooth.ProsthodonticsDenturesDiscover the difference with the new Fountain of Youth Dentures™.

He graduated magna cum laude from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology in 2008. After spending time with his own general dentist, appreciating both the art and science required, he became inspired to pursue a career in dentistry. In 2013, he earned his Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Dentistry. To enhance his knowledge and skills after dental school, he completed a one year Advanced Education General Dentistry residency at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA).PreventiveTeeth CleaningYour family’s dental health depends on having a family dentist near Springfield, VA. A family dentist will focus on preventive care to keep your teeth and gums healthy and strong. While at home dental care including brushing and flossing is important for healthy teeth and gums, it is just as important to have professional teeth cleanings which thoroughly gets rid of plaque buildup. You should have a dental cleaning and checkup at least every six months or as suggested by your family dentist near Springfield, VA.Fluoride TreatmentFluoride —Fluoride treatments will help strengthen your teeth and prevent tooth decay. Your family dentist may also recommend certain toothpastes and mouthwashes that contain fluoride.Dental SealantsSealants —Your family dentist may suggest dental sealant which is a thin plastic coating applied over your back teeth where you have tiny grooves and ridges that are hard to brush, and plaque can hide. Covering up these grooves and ridges with a dental sealant will help prevent tooth decay. Dental sealants are recommended as preventive dentistry for most children.DiagnosticDental ExaminationTeeth whitening by a dentist near Springfield, VA will allow your dentist to give you an oral exam. This will help him determine if bleaching is the correct method of treatment based on the type and extent of the stains and the number of restorations and their locations within your mouth. Your dentist near Springfield, VA will be able to match the type of stain with the best treatment to lighten your stains.X-raysDental X —rays—Dental x-rays are important so that your family dentist can detect cavities, certain tumors, bone infections and other diseases related to the mouth that cannot be detected with the naked eye.Oral and Maxillofacial SurgeryOral SurgeryGum SurgeryTooth ExtractionsDental technicians have been around for a long time. Tooth extraction has been practiced from the time of early man, most of which would not qualify as comfortable. From those painful beginnings sprung the practice of modern dentistry. Because of the pain they were formerly associated with, dentists were made fun of constantly. We had one-liners like this Rodney Dangerfield quote: "I told my dentist that my teeth were going yellow. He told me to wear a brown tie." Dentists know that many of us are still motivated to visit them because of pain or the threat of pain! But, in case you were not aware, you can now visit the dentist for 'pain-free' treatment - unlike those days when pain from toothaches trumped everything else.PeriodonticsPeriodontal SurgeryOriginally developed as a simple communication to help patients understand the differences between the LANAP protocol and traditional periodontal surgery, the No Cut, No Sew, No Fear logo helps educate patients and increase treatment acceptance. By helping to reduce the fear associated with gum surgery, we can help more patients receive the treatment they need.Send to PhoneJohnson, Steven R, Dds - Steven R Johnson & Assoc4322 Ravensworth Rd, Annandale, VA 22003(703) 256-5870Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailJohnson, Steven R, Dds - Steven R Johnson & Assoc4322 Ravensworth Rd, Annandale, VA 22003(703) 256-5870Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Johnson, Steven R carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Johnson, Steven R currently holds license 2101106031 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Johnson, Steven R



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
