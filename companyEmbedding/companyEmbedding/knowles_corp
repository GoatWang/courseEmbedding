Overview



 At Knowles Corporation, we’ve achieved excellence in our industry for more than 70 years. We strive to continuously reinvent our industry and make products more powerful than before.Our products and solutions help our customers find more ways to put better technology to work for their customers. We are a market leader and global supplier of performance audio, intelligent audio, and specialty components in the mobile communications, consumer electronics, hearing health, military/space and other industrial end markets. Our deep understanding of acoustics and the audio ecosystem facilitated our natural progression from acoustic components, to integrated audio modules, into intelligent audio solutions. Supported by rigorous testing, we deliver consistently dependable and precise products including hearing aid components, MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) microphones, transducers, capacitors, and oscillators. We are also uniquely positioned to deliver advanced hardware and software solutions including intelligent microphones, voice processors, and other hardware and software solutions that optimize the performance of the audio signal path. We have always, and continue to, introduce disruptive communication technologies such as the world’s first miniature microphone and receiver for hearing aids in 1954 and the first surface mount MEMS (micro-electrical-mechanical systems) microphone in 2001. With the addition of Audience Inc. in 2015, a mobile voice and audio-processing company, we have the most comprehensive audio system capabilities and applications in the market.Headquartered in Itasca, Illinois, our global scale of more than 7,000 employees in 15 countries worldwide includes design centers in Europe, Asia, India and North America. Coupled with our significant investment in research and development, our scale enables us to remain agile and efficient and deliver groundbreaking technology to our customers with high-volume economies.Throughout our history, we have transformed the way people communicate and enjoy sound. Our solutions, which are used in more than 70 percent of hearing health products and 60 percent of mobile devices in the market, have enabled technology leaps. Our products are also widely used in the professional music industry – we created the first personal monitors for musicians – replacing floor monitors and improving sound quality for large-scale performances. Our devices, designed for mission critical applications, can also be found in military equipment and various outer space utilities including NASA’s Mars Curiosity Rover. In fact, our products amplified Neil Armstrong's words from the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.At Knowles, we hear possibility in unexpected places and are unified by a spirit of innovation to constantly push boundaries and connect people by bringing audio to life.

Knowles is committed to advancing audio technology and enabling differentiated performance. Our proven performance in acoustics and sub-miniature audio solutions uniquely positions us to develop superior solutions. These technologies can be applied to mobile devices, wearables, smart home automation and security systems, remote controllers, automotive and more. Our latest audio solutions include an I²S digital MEMS microphone that connects directly to an application processor providing a more efficient architecture and increase battery performance, and VoiceIQ™ which is the world’s first “always listening” voice detector that automatically adapt its performance to the acoustic environment and enable voice wake-up solution on a mobile handset with significant power savings.
VoiceIQ™Our latest innovation, VoiceIQ™, is the world’s first “always listening” voice detector capable to automatically adapt its performance to the acoustic environment and enable voice wake-up solution on a mobile handset with significant power savings.With VoiceIQ, consumers will be able to wake-up their portable device, launch specific commands by saying a single phrase, without touching the screen and expect a strong battery life. By embedding the software directly into the microphone, the intelligent sensor adapts to the noise in the environment, predicting the surroundings, such as a crowded restaurant versus a library, and dynamically adjusts its thresholds to detect user’s voice. This adaptive process decides when the rest of the audio chain must be awaken or in sleep mode creating a positive impact on the battery life.Features

Multi-mode architecture to meet portable design use cases: voice call, video recording, voice trigger, etc.
Ultra low power consumption in “always listening” mode of 0.4 milliwatts (mW)
Built-in adaptive Acoustic Activity Detect (AAD) engine to detect acoustic signature of voice with best in class performance in noisy environments
Design with interrupt management to wake up downstream audio system pathways













   
  


I²S Digital MEMS Microphone
In response to the growth of smaller, more efficient devices, Knowles developed the most advanced Inter-IC Sound, or I²S, interface MEMS microphone for wearables, smartphones, remote controllers, automotive, and smart appliances.Using this I²S interface, the bottom port digital MEMS microphone allows manufacturers to connect directly to an application processors or microcontrollers. The result is a more efficient architecture due to decreased complexity, increased battery performance, and a lower cost bill of material. As a result, Knowles’ solution is superior in size and power consumption, with a 25 percent smaller footprint and 50 percent lower current consumption than competitive products.The new technology easily integrates with existing mobile device architecture and simplifies system integration through a direct connection to signal processors.Features

Direct attachment to applications processors (no audio codec necessary)
High performance requires less board space
Meet Super Wideband requirements
Far field capable with the possibility to connect dual MIC on same I2S bus
Low current consumption while maintaining high performance

360° voiceAllows conference call participants to be heard clearly, regardless of their position relative to the device. 360° voice technology allows smartphone designers greater freedom than legacy beamforming solutions, which typically process signals from two to four microphones pointed at the assumed position of the user.    









Intelligent key click removalNeuroscience-inspired to deliver a deeper level of keystroke noise suppression in periods of both quiet and speech. Leveraging deep neural network techniques to Knowles intelligent key click removal maintains natural voice quality, allowing users to stay productive without disrupting conference calls.   









Speech recognition assistLeveraging Knowles advanced voice noise suppression technologies, our custom hardware-accelerated algorithms enhance machine comprehension for speech recognition apps, delivering accuracy improvements of up to 40%.    









Acoustic design flexibilityBecause Knowles' family of earSmart algorithms do not solely depend on microphones pointed directly at the user, designers can place them in bezels, palm rests, or other areas that don’t require drilling holes through glass—without sacrificing quality.

Strong emphasis on basing decisions on data and analysis. You are expected to understand the implications and ramifications of each decision, and take actions as appropriate to mitigate risks without specific instructions -- best for those who can set their own priorities and execute to them without close direction. Also best for those who can tolerate making decisions involving some level of risk.Work with talented, driven, and capable people around the world(Note: I can only rate the consumer electronics division)ConsSchedules and travel can be demanding, though the company is generally flexible about schedule as long as work gets done.

Newly public Knowles Corp. faces a bumpy start


For shareholders in metro Chicago's newest publicly traded company, Knowles Corp., the next few months promise to be rocky. Blame it on the smartphone industry's disappointing duo, Nokia and BlackBerry. Knowles, maker of miniature speakers and receivers, was spun off this month from its conglomerate parent, Dover Corp. The Itasca-based company enjoyed a sixfold burst in revenue between 2005 and 2013, to $1.22 billion. But the company already is warning that first-quarter revenue will slide 4 to 6 percent from a year ago, with sales in its key mobile consumer electronics segment decreasing as much as 9 percent. Operating profit is projected to fall 15 to 20 percent.







As a result, the stock has moved but a little from its debut at $31.23 on March 3 to $31.02 on March 14. “We face some headwinds early this year,” acknowledges Jeffrey Niew, 47, Knowles' president and CEO. “But we think those headwinds will shift behind us after the third quarter.”  Knowles, which dates back almost 70 years, has been the world's No. 1 maker of transistor-based microphones—the first words spoken by astronaut Neil Armstrong on the moon 45 years ago were broadcast through a Knowles microphone in his helmet. More recently, it prospered by supplying tiny audio components to mobile phone giants Nokia Corp. and BlackBerry Ltd. (previously known as Research in Motion Ltd.), as well as makers of hearing aids and other electronic gadgets. The ups and downs of consumer electronics may be why it was cut loose by Dover, a Downers Grove-based manufacturing conglomerate better known for its staid portfolio of refrigeration and food-service products and printing. “Dover is a hard-core industrial company aimed at investors who favor value stocks,” says Harsh Kumar, a Memphis, Tenn.-based analyst at financial services firm Stephens Inc. “Meanwhile Knowles is an electronics company with a much growthier outlook. It was not a very good match to its parent company.” Dover executives decline to comment. Knowles is struggling because its big customers are struggling. In the past year, both Finland's Nokia and BlackBerry, which is based outside Toronto, have ceded market share to smartphone leaders Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea and Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple Inc.  Those two source their smartphones in Asia, where rivals to Knowles have taken chunks of business away. The best-known is AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. of  Shenzhen, China, with nearly $1 billion in sales last year and luxurious 44 percent gross profit margins, compared with Knowles' 38 percent."At one point we had 100 percent of the market,” Mr. Niew says. “We always knew that secondary sources would be coming along. But our share is still between 70 and 75 percent.”  The company is catching on with the other smartphone makers fast, analysts say. Knowles' advantage is reputed to be the best research and development work in the industry and a keen eye for cost-cutting.







The company is moving its hearing-aid production from China to the Philippines this year after its 1,000-member Chinese workforce won minimum wages of $3.50 an hour, up from 60 cents an hour when Knowles arrived in 1996. “Our labor costs will be halved in the Philippines,” estimates Mr. Niew, who is closing plants on other fronts to consolidate production in fewer places.
DEBT PROTECTION
Knowles, founded by acoustical engineer Hugh Knowles in 1946, was the first maker of transistor-based microphones. He died in 1988 at age 84, and about a decade later the family sold the business to an investment group headed by English firm Doughty Hanson & Co. Dover bought Knowles in 2005 for $750 million. Mr. Niew, formerly the chief operating officer, took the CEO title a year ago. Dover stuck Knowles with some $400 million in debt in the spinoff, but Mr. Kumar is unconcerned. “Their interest payments currently are running $10 million a year, and the company is generating $100 million a year in free cash flow, so they've got adequate protection on the debt side,” he says. Earnings will be down slightly in the first half of the year, he says, but a big fourth quarter should propel the company to full-year profits of $191.2 million, or $2.24 a share, up from $180.2 million, or $2.12 a share, in 2013. Both Mr. Kumar and JMP Securities in San Francisco rate the stock a “buy” with a price target of $36. Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co. in Chicago, expects Dover, which invested heavily in Knowles recently, to trade up after the spinoff. “Dover is finding success in getting rid of non-core businesses,” he says.  As for Knowles, he expects bumpy profits as it reshuffles customers in the volatile consumer electronics field. “Owning that stock will be like riding a bucking bronco,” Mr. Heymann says. “Knowles theoretically should enjoy more growth than Dover, but Dover's growth is much more predictable and homogenous across its portfolio.”

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
