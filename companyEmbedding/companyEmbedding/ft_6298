Asked by: Ewald

            Thank you for your recent inquiry with The Home Depot. Unfortunately, we do not stock this item in an 8' x 10' size. The largest we carry is 5' x 8'.

It looked great when we first received it. However after a couple vacuums the edges are coming undone. I expected it to be better quality with Home Depot putting there name by it.

        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!

They shine light in the dark where we need it most, whether it's an exterior fixture that adds safety and security to your property or a tiny night light bulb that keeps your kids comfortable at night. Walmart's Light Bulbs department has everything from high-wattage flood light bulbs to tiny bulbs for flashlights and other small appliances. No matter what kind of bulb you need, you can find it here at our Every Day Low Prices. Buy in bulk to stock up so you'll never have to worry about being in the dark for longer than it takes to replace an old bulb with a new one. From old-fashioned incandescent bulbs to high-efficiency CFL and LED styles and even some decorative options, this section is the only stop you need for all the lighting replacement requirements in your life.Incandescent vs. CFL vs. LEDBefore shopping for bulbs, it's important to understand what's out there. The difference between the three major lightbulb categories is significant, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses.Incandescent bulbs are the classic lightbulb style with the iconic bulb shape and a coil inside. These bulbs provide soft, warm light with differing levels of brightness depending on the kind of glass the manufacturer uses to encase the lighting element. Colored or frosted glass makes the light shine in different hues or in a softer way than a clear, unfrosted glass bulb. Incandescent lights burn out more quickly than other bulb types and use more energy, making them a more expensive choice overall.CFL, which stands for "compact fluorescent lamp," is a small bulb that uses fluorescent technology to run. These bulbs were first introduced on a large scale in the late 20th century, and the technology has advanced dramatically since then. The light quality they gave off was, at first, unappealing to many people, but lightbulb manufacturers have managed to make CFL bulbs with a wider range of light quality. These days, many of them are indistinguishable from incandescent bulbs. CFL bulbs last much longer than incandescents, and they also use a lot less energy. They can cost more up front, but they end up costing less than incandescent in the long run. These are a good choice for anyone looking to save money and live in a more environmentally friendly way.LED bulbs are another good choice for those who want to save on lighting costs, switch their bulbs out less often and help the environment. When compared to incandescent lightbulbs, LEDs offer a much longer life, lower operating cost and the added benefit of being much cooler to the touch while they're on. led bulbs cost more up front than CFLs do, but they can have up to double the life of a CFL bulb, making them a wiser upfront investment. Both CFLs and LEDs have low operating costs, but LEDs run cooler than CFLs do (though CFLs are cooler to the touch than incandescent bulbs). If you're looking for the most efficient, safest bulb, LED is the best choice. If you have less money to spend up front but want to invest in something efficient, a CFL bulb may be the best choice. If you prefer the warm glow of an incandescent bulb and aren't concerned with overall cost, environmental friendliness or efficiency, you can stick with the traditional incandescent choice.Choosing the right bulbFinding the right light bulb is no longer just a matter of reading the wattage information on your lamp. While that information is certainly helpful, you now have more options than a standard incandescent bulb, which is typically the only information listed on a lamp. Some modern lamps do include lumen information for CFL and LED bulbs, but if you aren't sure exactly what you need, Walmart has some helpful tools that you can use to select the right bulb. Our Light Bulbs department has a Find the Right Light Bulb tool that you can use to determine which CFL, LED, incandescent or halogen bulb is right for your needs. Look for this and other tools in the Shopping Tools section of the toolbar to the left on the main Light Bulb department page.Smart light bulbsOne other option to consider is the Smart Light Bulb category. These bulbs provide light as a basic function, but they also do more than that depending on what you need. For example, some smart bulbs are able to display a whole rainbow of colors, which you can manipulate via an app on a connected wireless device or with a remote control, which is included with your bulb purchase. These bulbs can also have additional features that you control through the app or remote, including dimming, special effects like strobing and timed on and off cycles. These bulbs can be fun for kids and teenagers to play with in their rooms, or they can add elegant ambience and a party atmosphere to a dining or living room. There are many different ways to use them, whether it's to add mood and style to a room or to provide a specific light color spectrum for family members with visual impairments.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863239, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

This includes simple tasks like changing a light bulb or running power somewhere else through an extension cord, along with more detailed tasks like replacing a dead outlet or adding a dimmer switch to an overhead light. For the do-it-yourselfer   or the DIYer at heart   check our vast line of electrical supplies. With our low prices, every day, on everything, you can save money while getting projects completed.Light bulbsLighting has come a long way since the days of incandescent-only bulbs. When it comes to light bulbs, we have many from which you can choose:Incandescent light bulbs   A long-time standard for bulbs, the U.S. government started phasing these out in 2007 because of the Energy Independence and Security Act. However, they're still available to purchase. They use a filament that heats up until it glows and produces light.Fluorescent light bulbs   These bulbs are filled with mercury vapor that emits light when heated. They typically work best when used in conjunction with a ballast.Light-emitting diode light bulbs   led bulbs are energy-efficient bulbs that have an electrical current that flows through semiconductors and lights up the diodes in the bulb. These stay cool to the touch thanks to a heat sink that absorbs heat.Compact fluorescent light bulbs   CFL bulbs are also energy efficient and use an electrical current that flows between the electrodes located at the end of a gas-filled tube. This then produces light that becomes visible after striking a phosphorus coating inside the bulb.Halogen light bulbs   These work the same way that an incandescent light bulb does, but they're more energy efficient.High-intensity discharge light bulbs   HID bulbs are filled with either mercury or sodium vapor that conducts electricity when heated. These bulbs are usually found in larger, open spaces like offices or stores.Smart light bulbs   These are typically LED bulbs that you can control remotely via your home Wi-Fi. They let you adjust the lighting inside or outside of your home while you're away, typically via a mobile-device app.Night light bulbs   These small light bulbs fit into lamps that emit very little light but make it easier to see in the dark.Extension cordsThere are three basic types of extension cords: occasional use, frequent use and rugged cords. Some of these cords are flexible, which means that they're fine for typical use. If you want to use an extension cord outside, however, look for one that's rated for outdoor usage. Most extension cords are made with 300-volt insulation. If your extension cords will receive heavier use, such as when you're using them to operate large power or landscaping tools, look for ones with 600-volt insulation. For indoor appliance use or for air conditioners, look for extension cords with parallel-wire construction. Extension cords come with plugs that have either two or three prongs, with heavy-duty cords usually having three prongs to stay grounded. Technically, power strips or surge protectors are forms of extension cords, but these are mostly used for powering or protecting electronic devices like TVs and computers.Dimmers, switches, wall plates and outletsLight switches and electrical outlets sometimes need replacing, and we have the components you need to make the switch. As with anything electrical, you want to make sure that the power to the outlet is turned off at the breaker before making any changes. Simply follow the instructions provided with your replacement outlet or light switch, then restore the power to check out your handiwork. Consider replacing dirty or outdated wall plates when making these fixes. You can even swap out your existing light switch for a dimmer switch, which regulates the amount of electrical current to your light source.Other electrical suppliesWhen working on your home, it may be necessary to test or replace other fixtures. Other electrical supplies you may need include: Testers   Testers and multimeters check the amount of current going to an outlet or electrical source, letting you know if something is underperforming or needs replacing.Wire and cable   We have different lengths of wire and cable, ranging from 5 inches or less to 45 inches or more, for use when replacing defective wiring or cables.Circuit breakers and fuses   Replacing a circuit breaker is better left to an electrician, but if you have the skills, we have 12-volt and 24-volt varieties available in many different amp sizes.doorbells   Replacing a doorbell is much like replacing a light switch, and many are available in kits that include wireless remote control units.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167313236, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Both CFLs and LEDs have low operating costs, but LEDs run cooler than CFLs do (though CFLs are cooler to the touch than incandescent bulbs). If you're looking for the most efficient, safest bulb, LED is the best choice. If you have less money to spend up front but want to invest in something efficient, a CFL bulb may be the best choice. If you prefer the warm glow of an incandescent bulb and aren't concerned with overall cost, environmental friendliness or efficiency, you can stick with the traditional incandescent choice.Choosing the right bulbFinding the right light bulb is no longer just a matter of reading the wattage information on your lamp. While that information is certainly helpful, you now have more options than a standard incandescent bulb, which is typically the only information listed on a lamp. Some modern lamps do include lumen information for CFL and LED bulbs, but if you aren't sure exactly what you need, Walmart has some helpful tools that you can use to select the right bulb. Our Light Bulbs department has a Find the Right Light Bulb tool that you can use to determine which CFL, LED, incandescent or halogen bulb is right for your needs. Look for this and other tools in the Shopping Tools section of the toolbar to the left on the main Light Bulb department page.Smart light bulbsOne other option to consider is the Smart Light Bulb category. These bulbs provide light as a basic function, but they also do more than that depending on what you need. For example, some smart bulbs are able to display a whole rainbow of colors, which you can manipulate via an app on a connected wireless device or with a remote control, which is included with your bulb purchase. These bulbs can also have additional features that you control through the app or remote, including dimming, special effects like strobing and timed on and off cycles. These bulbs can be fun for kids and teenagers to play with in their rooms, or they can add elegant ambience and a party atmosphere to a dining or living room. There are many different ways to use them, whether it's to add mood and style to a room or to provide a specific light color spectrum for family members with visual impairments.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332920, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

The Vintage feel we all LOVE about a Chincoteague cottage is right here. Own a piece of history..This home was once owned by Miles Hancock, one of Chincoteague's finest carvers. Built in 1955, all the BEST details are still here but now with the modern conveniences and comforts we love! The original trim, door hardware and wood floors are intact BUT now there's BRAND NEW stainless steel appliances, NEW solid surface counter tops and white painted cottage cabinets in a HUGE eat-in kitchen. There's NEW vinyl windows, a vinyl fence, hot&cold outdoor shower, concrete driveway, 3 CAR detached GARAGE, new hot water heater and a great YARD.....this home checks all the boxes. This home requires NO flood insurance,it's NOT in a flood zone! Comes with a ONE YEAR HOME WARRANTY, buy with CONFIDENCE!
