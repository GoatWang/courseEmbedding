            Do I have to assemble it?
        


Asked by: Anonymous

            You do have to assemble it- but with two people it is pretty easy- takes about 8 hrs.
The store probably provides a assembly service for a fee.

Time will tell ! for now its good, only problem was they didn't ask me which side I wanted the window.
Also they left some screws for me to finish putting in and one shelf, other than that it was done well.
Also in the video they have a touch light which I didn't get and asked for one without a reply back.
Once its assembled and sold they are done with you, plus you have to deal with 4 entities,
1. store you purchase from.
2. builder of product which is based in NYC.
3. delivery of product.
4. installer of said product.
Miss the old days when you worked with one company that did all 4 things !

Our new Life Time storage shed looks like a little house. We love it. We had a professional build the shed on our new 
concrete slab. We purchased extra peg strips. The peg strips do not match up to the existing drilled holes.
We have not had any problem with having to put bigger screws which I read in the reviews. Nothing has falling
down. We have heavy shovels etc hanging. We will now purchase the shutters for the storage shed from Life Time.
Purchased February 2017
Most of all I am glad to have it made in the U.S.A.

It's a cute little shed! Was pretty easy to assemble. Has lasted against the wind and snow so far. The only reason I don't rate it higher is because I don't think it's worth the 1k I paid for it. The material is pretty soft. You have to put it together very delicately otherwise the screws will strip the plastic. Wouldn't stand very long if someone was trying to break into it. Also was led to believe by the commercial that a battery-operated light came with it, and there was no light that came with mine. But it's a nice little shed to keep the garden tools in. If it were a $400 shed, I'd have given it a full 5 stars.

I purchased this almost a month by the time it gets installed. The problem isn't the shed it's the unprofessionalism and disorganization of the company they contract with to put it together. The shed has been sitting in my driveway for 2 weeks and it'll be 4 by the time they come.

The shed was fairly easy to put together. I recommend two people and you must have a flat surface. I would of liked the anchor points in the middle of the roof to be a bit stronger. The perimeter is much stronger.

Fairly easy assembly, took a good afternoon and definitely need 2 people, 1 to hold, one to screw.  It was a little tough to get certain parts together, but it worked in the end.  I'd say it's more grey than tan in color, but looks great.  The concrete pad I poured was a little wonky in places but it still worked for it.  The doors need a little coaxing to close, but they still lock, it's not perfect, but it's also a plastic shed so as much is expected.  Overall I'm happy with the purchase.

the shed was great very easy to put together looks very nice the only thing I have to say is they call it tan and brown it's more light gray and dark gray which is better for me but some other people might not like that.

This shed must be built on a flat level foundation of wood or concrete (not included). It is designed with a slight indentation in each corner of the floor so that you can drill through the flooring to secure it to the foundation.
