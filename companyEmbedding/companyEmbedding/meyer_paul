Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.

Humble Beginnings

Paul J. Meyer’s extraordinary life and legacy seem unlikely for a boy born into a poor immigrant family in 1928. Paul’s parents gave him something far greater than material wealth — they instilled Christian values along with strong moral principles, a robust work ethic, and a burning desire to learn and excel. These values and early life lessons were the building blocks for Paul’s stellar success.
Paul rose from humble beginnings to great wealth and great achievement, gaining acclaim and a host of admiring friends.

Paul was raised in very modest living conditions by his parents who lived in a
tent when they first married in 1923. As an adult, Paul owned multiple homes
and lavish beachfront properties in some of the world’s most sought-after
Paul’s first bicycle as a young boy was salvaged from a junk yard. As an adult, he owned luxury automobiles, a classic car collection featuring 1936 Fords and other rare antique vehicles, luxury boats and elite motor coaches. Paul, an avid pilot, also flew his own antique Piper Cub and traveled around the world in private jets.
Paul’s childhood jobs included working in the orchards and vineyards with migrant farm workers, working in a cannery, trimming trees, and digging tree stumps. As a young adult, Paul became a self-made millionaire who eventually owned dozens of companies, both in the U.S. and worldwide.

After a particularly grueling workday, young Paul asked his mother, “Am I going to have to do manual labor all my life?” His mother’s insightful response profoundly influenced Paul’s life. She put her hands on her son’s head, looked straight into his eyes, and said, “You have everything right in here to do anything and be anything you want.”
Paul later said as an adult,
“At that moment I knew the choice was mine, and everything depended on my attitude. The world’s abundance was mine to earn and to possess.”
The life lessons Paul learned from his parents didn’t stop with a positive attitude. Paul’s father, a German immigrant, was a master craftsman who instilled in his children a standard of excellence in everything they did. Paul’s mother trained as a teacher and a nurse. She nurtured Paul’s desire to learn and to teach others and to practice the principles of success in all areas of life.
Paul enthusiastically put into practice all that his parents taught him. He used the same positive attitude and “out of the box” thinking to serve him well throughout his entire life and in the world of business, where he touched the lives of millions of people by motivating them to reach their full potential.

Faith & Family

One of Paul J. Meyer’s favorite – and oft-quoted – verses demonstrated his single-minded focus of being a good steward for the blessings God gave him. Dr. Bill M. Hinson, Paul’s pastor and friend for more than 53 years, said he often cited Philippians 3:14, “I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ,” as motivation for the way he lived his life and his faith.
Paul J. Meyer believed, deeply, that the blessings in his life were not his, as he famously said, it all belonged to God. This went beyond his wealth, though, and Paul sought to steward these gifts God gave him through his wife, Jane, and his five children as diligently as he did the money he gave to missions through tithing.
“It was so refreshing to me as a young pastor to see his commitment. His Christian commitment to Christ affected everything that he did,” Dr. Hinson said. “It affected his stewardship, it affected his martial relationship, his family relationship and his testimony stood out because of the way he lived his life day by day.”
Paul J. Meyer’s faith is reflected in his priorities. Throughout his life, he always listed his priorities in the following order by importance to him: God, his wife, his family, his health and fitness, and, finally, his business.
As Paul’s success grew, Dr. Hinson said that Paul’s actions drew many similarly young and successful professionals to him. He became a role model for many in his church, as Dr. Hinson pointed out that Paul did not become distracted or sidetracked by the temptations that lead many men in his position astray.
“With Paul, his commitment was so evident in everything he did,” Dr. Hinson said. “He felt like with his Christian faith, and being faithful to his wife and his children, he didn’t have time to be distracted (by those sins).”
Paul was diligent in the stewardship of his relationship with Jane. He took time to grow his relationship and model to his children how a godly husband treats his wife, and together, they showed how a couple keeps God first in their marriage. Paul also kept his children a priority – ensuring that he was present and an active part of their lives – that he was not just the good father they expected, but that he was present as the spiritual head of their home and a great encouragement in their walks with Christ.
In his business, Paul modeled for his children how to be a Christian business leader who used his faith to strengthen his business and used the wealth he gained to further Christ’s Kingdom.
The greatest gifts Paul J. Meyer’s parents gave him were an appreciation for the blessings of life, the work ethic to use and develop his God-given abilities, and an unshakable faith in the goodness of his Creator. Paul and Jane lived out these values through their marriage, as they were of one accord, holding God first, each other second, and their families third in their shared priorities, and they have passed these gifts on to their children, knowing these intangible blessings would continue to benefit them as they had Paul and Jane.

Awards & Recognition

As a young adult, Paul coined the following affirmation:
 “Whatever  you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon must inevitably come to pass.”
These powerful words enabled him to hurdle the barriers, survive the setbacks, and find the right path to ultimate success of his goals. This phrase became one of the defining quotes of his life and work. During his lifetime, Paul broke records, set standards and received many honors and accolades for a life lived with purpose and a commitment to excellence.
“Citizens of the world” is a phrase often used to describe Paul and Jane Meyer. Their work to improve conditions for others around the globe received international awards. Moreover, during the half-century that his companies attained worldwide recognition, Paul was awarded honorary doctorates from five universities in America and one from a university in Scotland. Subject of at least three books, Paul was mentioned in more than 100 others and received awards and honors from more than 50 civic and business organizations worldwide. Jane Meyer accompanied Paul on his journey of achievements, and she also distinguished herself along the way.
Paul J. Meyer has been greatly honored by Baylor University for his continued service and support of the institution’s students and Christian mission. The following high honors and distinctions have been bestowed on Paul by Baylor University – a small representation of the many distinctions honoring Mr. Meyer at the institution:

Herbert H. Reynolds Award
R. White Meritorious Service Award
Alumnus Honoris Causa, the highest honor bestowed upon an individual who is not an alumnus of Baylor University
Sesquicentennial Council of 150
Paul J. Meyer Arena at the Ferrell Center, named in honor of Paul for his transformational support of the Center.

Of the countless commendations Paul J. Meyer earned during his life, he was particularly proud of becoming an Eagle Scout within the Boy Scouts of America and being granted the highest awards for service to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Below are listed a few of his many honors, awards, and recognitions:

Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, Boy Scouts of America
James E. West Fellowship Award, Boy Scouts of America
Good Shepherd Emblem, Boy Scouts of America
National Sales Leadership Award, Houston Sales Association
Freedoms Foundation Award, Valley Forge, Penn.
Investor Hall of Fame for Investment Excellence
Philanthropist of the Year, Central Texas Chapter of Fundraising Professionals
Roaring Lambs Hall of Fame, Dallas, Texas
Distinguished Founders Award, Haggai Institute
The Barnabas Award, First Baptist Church of Woodway, Texas

Jane Meyer has also received several awards, recognizing her own selfless service and support of many organizations. Several representative awards to Jane Meyer reflect her wide variety of interests and contributions:

R. White Meritorious Service Award, Baylor University
Alumna Honoris Causa, Baylor University
Life Member in the President’s Leadership Circle Award, University of Mary Hardin-Baylor
Yellow Rose of Texas, commissioned by the Governor of Texas

As the recognition of many institutions and organizations demonstrates, Paul and Jane Meyer have created a transformational legacy. They have lived out Paul’s favorite affirmation, reflecting a true fulfillment of their lifelong desire to do God’s will. Their lives are a testimony to pursuing God’s calling, as Paul said, like an athlete running a race: with a single-minded focus, so that “whatever you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon – with the emphasis on action – must inevitably come to pass.”

SoapStone
Branding and PackagingSoapstone is a company that produces concentrated soaps for people who are taking long adventures into the wilderness. In order to appear trustworthy and established, the brand draw inspiration from turn of the century design in layouts and illustration.Within this project I had the opportunity to create the logo utilizing hand lettering as well as hand made illustrations. With the packaging, multiple options were created o that the bottles could be stored in a travel kit along with other items. The packaging itself included the product bottles and kits, both of which are designed to be portable and reflect a place that you could take the product.

The company's slogan is "Adventure rated clothing for those wild by nature".For this company I get to design a variety of products being hats, t-shirts, tank tops, sweatshirts, etc...

Joe Java-Stout : Storyteller
LOGOJoe Java-stout is a blogger who focuses on the topic of craft beer and the connections that beer makes between people. Joe tells stories of his favorite beers, places and events in a local radius so that others can follow his stories and experience the things he gets to. For this logo I wanted to create something as personal as Joe so I decided to hand-letter his name, as if he had done it himself. I also created an illustration that captures a moment in every tap room that Joe longs for and enjoys, the cheers. Together these elements convey a personability that Joe needs to accomplish since he medium is blogging. The color choices are based off of Joe's favorite brews and help to give a worn and established look to the logo, as Joe is experienced in his craft.Go read Joe's Blog:Joejavastout.com


















Loocyd Music
LOGOLoocyd Music is an artist who creates a variety of genres of music. He specializes in genres that take a darker approach to melodies and harmonies, which makes his music unique in many ways. For this logo I wanted to create something that reflected the darker, more psychedelic undertones of the music that he creates. In order to do this I hand illustrated the type and then created a way for a mark to be pulled from the name logo. this mark is an abstracted face, whose mouth furthers the idea of music through the lines representing the movement of an EQ bar and sound waves. Check out Loocyd music at:https://soundcloud.com/loocyd-1

Here are posters I have designed for different occasions and projects.

Compass Brand
LOGO, PRODUCT DESIGNCompass Brand: The Weekend Brand is an apparel company that focuses on having fun in everything you do and live life to the fullest. They offer head-wear as well as shirts and other clothing options.For this company I created a logo that captures the fun and serious side of the brand through the typefaces. The fun typeface displayed the name and allows the brand to be exciting and outgoing while the serious typeface communicates that they are serious about their business and delivering the highest quality in their product. Besides the logo I also designed the first two product lines that the company released, which included hats ans t-shirts. On the hats I was able to custom every stitch, so everything was design with the brand in mind. I also photographed the product as well as people in it for a social media campaign and the website.

Overview

Baptist preacher and close friend of D.L. Moody, Frederick Brotherton Meyer chronicled the lives of many biblical figures, but calls his biography of Paul “by far the most interesting” to write. “For days and weeks together,” he notes, “I have lived in the company of this glorious man; but only to feel that he transcended all one’s loftiest conceptions. Like some great mountain range, the more his character is traversed, the more it grows on the imagination.” Looking mainly to the Epistles, Meyer describes Paul’s life from his own writings—his life as it appeared to him. Gain insight into the prolific apostle as Meyer shares fruit of many years of reflection and study. In this engaging biography, you’ll journey through the twists and turns of Paul’s life while Meyer reveals the colorful story of a man fully yielded to God.


In the Logos edition, Paul: A Servant of Jesus Christ is enhanced by amazing functionality. Scripture citations link directly to English translations, and important terms link to dictionaries, encyclopedias, and a wealth of other resources in your digital library. Bolster your study of Meyer’s work by cross-referencing and comparing with an extensive library of scholarship. Use the Timeline to connect events and people discussed to other biblical and world events. Perform powerful searches to find exactly what you’re looking for. Take the discussion with you using tablet and mobile apps. With Logos Bible Software, the most efficient and comprehensive research tools are in one place, so you get the most out of your study.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
