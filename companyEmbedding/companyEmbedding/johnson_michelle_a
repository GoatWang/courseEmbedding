In fact, there seems to be a direct correlation between the amount of smoking and the likelihood of cataracts. Cataracts are characterised by the clouding of the lens of the eye and it is believed that smoking affects the cells of the lens, accelerating this process.EndocrinologistDiabetes CareDiabetic RetinopathySmoking has also been linked to dry eyes, optic nerve damage and diabetic retinopathy (for those with diabetes).NeurologistsMultiple SclerosisGeneral PractitionersAllergiesArthritisWomen are nine times more likely to develop Sjogren’s than men and diagnosis usually occurs around the age of 40. Unfortunately, because the symptoms vary from person to person, and the disease often occurs in the presence of or mimics other diseases (such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, menopause, allergies or multiple sclerosis) the disease is often misdiagnosed or overlooked. Further, because the symptoms can affect different parts of the body system such as the teeth, eyes or musculoskeletal system, various health professionals are sought to diagnose or treat specific symptoms (such as rheumatologists, dentists or eye doctors) while the big picture is often missed. On average it takes almost three years to obtain a Sjogren’s diagnosis once symptoms are noticed.Weight ManagementPrimary CareEmergency CareStudies have shown that an overwhelming number of emergency room visits could have been treated by an optometric Physician. These ranged from foreign bodies to severe eye allergies to eye infections as the most common reasons for emergency room visits. It is not always necessary to go to an emergency room for eye emergencies.

They are the most comfortable shoes!!Back in BlackThis women's Sketcher shoe does provide good support pleased with purchase!comfythese shoes have been my go to shoe with my summer pantsGreat PurchaseI really like these shoes, the look and feel is great.  This is the first pair of multi-toned shoes that I have purchased and the shoe is very comfortable and extends my wardrobe options.  I would purchase these shoes again.SOOOOO CUTE!!!These shoes are absolutely adorable!  Good fit and beautifully detailed. Recommended for women who love a little height in their step!!!Only 3 stars becauseThere are so many cute shoes...especially the mules and clogs. Most women dare not buy shoes without trying on. There I am scrolling the shoes. There were some that didn't give size option. These  slip ons of course looked softer on screen. They are however well made leather mules. Didn't wish to returm so I must find a way to soften them. Did I say cute and under *** CustomerGreat shoe for walking. Very comfortable. I really like these shoes.Sexy and comfortableBest shoes for women that love style but whose feet can't handle heels! The slight wedge heel gives yu some height, but all the comfort of flats, with a great look.  Love these shoes.  It' my second pair as I wore the first ones out after a year of wearing them everyday as I live in Florida and can wear them year round.Beautiful shoe!This shoe was purchased for my niece's wedding, for another niece to wear in the wedding.  Though she has not yet seen the shoe, I think it is a beautiful shoe.Sponsored LinksWhat's This?BootsSandalsHeelsWomens' Athletic ShoesFlatsLoafersSizes89111077.58.56125.556.59.510.5134.511.514412.53151612.5MediumLargeSmallExtra Large213.53.51.5S-M17L-XLStylesDressComfortPumpsMary JaneAthleticPlatformAnkle StrapWalkingPeep ToeFlip FlopsSling BackStrappyHeeledSlideWorkTennisBallerinaBootieD'OrsayGolfChukkaAnkleT-StrapScuffEspadrilleSaddle ShoeRunningBoat ShoeMoccasinGladiatorOver-the-KneeEuroMid-calfDanceWesternRidingRainWedgeHikingSnowCombatWide CalfLace UpBasketballTrailWork ClogsHigh TopD-OrsayKnee HighThigh HighBrandsSkechersNikeClarksCoachAdidasBCBGenerationNine WestAerosolesMICHAEL Michael KorsEasy SpiritNaturalizerSteve MaddenCole HaanVansNew BalanceUGG AustraliaCalvin KleinPumaMichael KorsEasy Spirit e360Tommy HilfigerVince CamutoBandolinoGuessHush PuppiesBlowfishKedsFryeVia SpigaFranco SartoPropetLucky BrandJessica SimpsonUGGAsicsCorso ComoKenneth Cole ReactionIvanka TrumpDemoniaL'Artiste by Spring StepVaneliWalking CradlesRockportMuk LuksRos HommersonSTYLE & COINC INTERNATIONAL CONCEPTSRampageRocket DogMARC FISHERAmerican RagMadden GirlEasy StreetSpring StepLife StrideRoger VivierJournee CollectionOTBTAraMaterial GirlTrottersNinaSoftWalkTahariDolce VitaFergaliciousRoperCharles by Charles DavidRialtoBestonNot RatedKaren ScottTouch UpsCarlos by Carlos SantanaHoganMizunoAnne KleinChinese LaundryBella VitaPleaserWhite MountainAlfaniBearPawA2 by AerosolesCaparrosQupidBaretrapsKenneth Cole New YorkHadariFabuliciousDavid TateMIANature BreezeRose Petals by Walking CradlesMadelineBCBG Max AzriaMatisseDonald J PlinerBlueXOXOSort by:Sort ByBest SellingPrice Low - HighPrice High - LowAvg.

Style- like summer boat shoe but very sturdy and good for feet! Buy!LynneI am very pleased with Women's Skechers.  They are the most comfortable shoes!!Sexy and comfortableBest shoes for women that love style but whose feet can't handle heels! The slight wedge heel gives yu some height, but all the comfort of flats, with a great look.  Love these shoes.  It' my second pair as I wore the first ones out after a year of wearing them everyday as I live in Florida and can wear them year round.Beautiful shoe!This shoe was purchased for my niece's wedding, for another niece to wear in the wedding.  Though she has not yet seen the shoe, I think it is a beautiful shoe.CustomerGreat shoe for walking. Very comfortable. I really like these shoes.Women's Gravity Defyer Extora II White LeatherI had purchased, as a gift for my girlfriend, a pair of Gravity Defyer Women's G-Defy Iokia White Athletic Shoes, and she loved them so much that I purchased this pair of Women's Gravity Defyer Extora II White Leather shoes.  She is thrilled again!  One can't go wrong with Gravity Defyer shoes.  My girlfriend normally wears a Size 7 shoe, but I purchased Size 8 Gravity Defyer shoes for her and both pairs are perfect for her.Back in BlackThis women's Sketcher shoe does provide good support pleased with purchase!Beauty must sufferThese shoes are adorable but a little too high for me. I may see about shortening the heel because the shoes themselves are just beautiful!Only 3 stars becauseThere are so many cute shoes...especially the mules and clogs. Most women dare not buy shoes without trying on. There I am scrolling the shoes. There were some that didn't give size option. These  slip ons of course looked softer on screen. They are however well made leather mules. Didn't wish to returm so I must find a way to soften them.

Product Description▼▲
Mamie loved the game of baseball. She was also inspired by the great Jackie Robinson, and she was determined to become a profession baseball pitcher. But there was no place for a black woman in a sport dominated by white men. That didn't stop Mamie, though! She began by insisting on trying out for the all-male, all-white Police Athletic League team. Read the inspiring, courage-filled biography of Mamie Johnson, one of only three women who ever played in the Negro Leagues. Recommended for ages 10 and up.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Motivated by her love for the game and inspired by the legendary Jackie Robinson, Mamie Johnson is determined to be a professional baseball pitcher.  But in a sport that's determined by white men, there is no place for a black woman.  Mamie doesn't give up-from the time she insists on trying out for the all-male, all-white Police Athletic League until she realizes her dream and becomes one of three women to play in the Negro Leagues.  Mamie Johnson's life shows that with courage and perseverance one can overcome even the greatest challenges.

About Us
Foods Matter is an entirely independent informational website, the 'founder' site of the FoodsMatter family of sites, which includes sites dedicated to coeliac disease and gluten-related disorders, free from food, free from supplements and superfoods, free from recipes, raw foods and sensitive / allergic skin conditions.
The site was launched by Michelle Berriedale-Johnson over 20 years ago as back-up to the Foods Matter magazine, offering information and support both to food allergic and intolerant consumers and to the health professionals caring for them. Since the magazine  moved 'on line' in 2010, the sites have grown rapidly and now receive over 1,500,000 unique visitors per year.
The FoodsMatter sites are entirely independent. To help amortise the cost of maintaining the sites we do take advertising and affiliate links. However, these in no way compromise our editorial independence.
The family of sites have their own Facebook pages  and Twitter accounts.
For the FoodsMatter consultancy service go here.

Discover The $5 Solution to a Wrinkle Free Face - ALL EXPOSED TODAY!





Various sources across the internet have exposed a HUGE celebrity secret to erase wrinkles - without botox or surgery!

How do Hollywood starlets look so radiant and youthful well into 
thier 40's, 50's, and even 60's? Is it always expensive botox and 
dangerous  plastic surgery? According to various sources, the answer is NO! So if
 they aren't all using surgery to stay looking great, what is their 
secret? Keep reading, it's excitingly effective, safe, and cheap!
 
It is rumoured that some celebrities are aiming to look 10 to 15 years younger fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox. Many online sources have expressed suprise over how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective his technique was! Read on...
 
“Countless aging celebs are reported to have admitted they avoided surgery and look 20 years younger thanks to the simple advice.”


The Best Skin Solution You’ve Never Heard Of

The wrinkle secret has been reserved for high paying celebrity clients...until now. Consumers have reported throwing away thousands of dollars on expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make big promises that often do far more harm than good. As a result, a few weeks ago this simple solution was shared!
 
This anti aging miracle was reportedly found when multiple celebrity friends were hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career without going in for surgery.






“She looked 15 years younger in literally 2 weeks!”

 
They were reported to have been thrilled when after months and months of pain staking tests and research, the team came across 2 products that when combined supposedly took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month. More shockingly it is safe, and  costs next to nothing to try! The two products are Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.
  

“Possbily the best anti aging discovery of the decade.”
 
 
So what is it?



 2 Key Ingredients For Anti Aging:

1.  Vitamin C
  2.  Hyaluronic Acid



These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase 
wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the
 skin – which is why they’re so effective.
 
Vitamin C, The 1st Youth Discovery:
  The first piece of the anti aging puzzle discovered was Vitamin C.

 "Vitamin C is a secret anti aging trick”
Vitamin C penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new 
collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all 
the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study 
stating, applying non-prescription  Vitamin C to your skin  caused a large reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. This is why Oveena Anti Aging Cream is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Vitamin C in the right consistency and dosage.




Hyaluronic Acid:
  The second piece, when combined properly with Vitamin C, can make your face look two decades younger in weeks! Hyaluronic 
Acid works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its 
weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Hyaluronic
 acid helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from 
dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. Products you can buy over the counter with an effective 
concentration of Hyaluronic Acid was found in Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream . 





 




 
“What Vitamin C & Hyaluronic Acid do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin 
    generate fresh new ones. Our research shows that you can erase almost 10 to 
    20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose 
    the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality 
    ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only two we found during our research was Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream. This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients.”



"How do I do it?"


It's actually very simple. You simply use both products before bed. Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.
    These two products both contain high concentrations of pure Vitamin C 
    and Hyaluronic Acid in just the right concentrations. His team is also reported to have discovered 
    that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called 
    Dermaxyl (also known as facelift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active 
    anti-aging compound in Vitamin C). 




“Getting older is rough for an actress. I feel like a new woman!”




Put to the Test!
As excited as we were, we wanted to find an example of real usage of these type of products. We found one test where a volunteer from the office was used. A 57 year old mother of 3 jumped at the chance to test this combo and the results were pulished online. Here is her story...
 
Brenda's Story & 14 Day Cell Revival Results:
"Brenda is a 57 year old mother of 3 from here in Chicago. Like most 
women her age, the years have started to give her unwanted lines and 
wrinkles. Brenda said she volunteered because she is so frustrated that 
nothing she has tried seems to work. She was even considered highly 
risky and very expensive facelift procedure. This was somewhat of a last
 resort for her." 

Here are the reported results from the source....
 




 


Day 1:

"After the first day of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream together,
 I was surprised at how wonderful they both made my skin feel. It felt 
like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a 
gigantic vacuum cleaner.
 
I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling 
sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in 
the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of 
revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. 
 
After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it."



day 5:
 
"After five days of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream, I was shocked at the drastic results.
The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!
I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger 
again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!"




day 14:
 "After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES!

  The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows’ feet – even the age spots on my face had 
COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin
 with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!
 
After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that
way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and 
radiant as it was 20 years ago. By this point, all my 
friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, 
and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!"










Pictures of Brenda Wright at day 1, day 5 & day 14. The picture at the bottom was taken after only 14 days of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.


The Verdict:
Using the Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream combo,
 removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It 
tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and 
dehydrated skin.

Will This Work For You?

There are plenty of skincare gimmicks out there, and most of them are
 ridiculously expensive. With so many options it’s only natural for you 
to be skeptical about the results, and so we don't want to promise our 
readers anything, we simply want to challenge you to do what has been recommended: try it for yourself!

Remember, the published reports suggest you need to use both Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream in combination for best results.
