Robert B Pinkerton
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Illinois:













Does Robert B Pinkerton carry a valid contracting license?



The State of Illinois does not require a Home Improvement Contractor License at the state level. However, if your business is providing home improvement services in IL, you may be required to obtain a Home Improvement Contractor License at the local level or comply with other licensing laws at the state or local level.
Robert B Pinkerton currently holds license 062063118 (Professional Engineer), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Illinois?



Although Illinois does not require contractors to be licensed, check local regulations as certain jurisdictions may require licensing on a local level. 











Your liability risk when hiring Robert B Pinkerton



General Contractors in Illinois are not required to carry general liability insurance. It is always a good practice to only hire contractors with active liability and workers' compensation insurance policies. Request a copy of each certificate for your records before the project starts. 











Financial recourse when hiring Robert B Pinkerton



Illinois requires roofing contractors to obtain a surety bond. Home owners may file a claim to recoup money in the event of faulty work, or damages to their property incurred during a roof project. 











What else should I know before hiring Robert B Pinkerton



Illinois on the state level, has minimal regulations governing contractor licensing, in turn, consumers should be vigilant when hiring contractors, check on BuildZoom for customer reviews, and permit history as indicators of quality businesses. Check with local licensing authorities as some jurisdictions will require contractors to be licensed. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Illinois, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
