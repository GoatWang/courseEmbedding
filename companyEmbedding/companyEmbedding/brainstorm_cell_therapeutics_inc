Patient Access to NurOwn®





Exploring Patient Access to NurOwn®:
Brainstorm is exploring the possible commencement of a program to make NurOwn® available to a limited number of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, also known as motor neuron disease) through a regulatory pathway designated for an orphan drug with a good safety profile and strong efficacy signals.  This program would potentially provide patients, who today face an unmet need, with access to this investigational treatment before it receives final marketing approval from the regulatory authorities.


 
The decision to proceed with this program will be based on responses collected from patients that demonstrate that there is interest in receiving treatment via this pathway.  Making NurOwn® available in this way will require Brainstorm to invest in additional manufacturing facilities, recruit additional manpower and also to submit regulatory applications in various western countries.
 
NurOwn® uses proprietary culture conditions to induce mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to secrete high levels of neurotrophic factors known to promote the survival of neurons (nerve cells).   The product is manufactured using a process that involves taking a sample of bone marrow from a patient and then sending the bone marrow to a manufacturing facility where MSCs are isolated and grown under carefully managed conditions.  At the end of this process NurOwn® is harvested, placed into syringes and is ready to be delivered to the patient for an intrathecal administration.
 

Given the high costs associated with manufacturing, patients will be required to pay a fee in order to gain access to NurOwn®.
 
NurOwn® has been administered to approximately 70 patients with ALS in clinical trials conducted in the United States and Israel. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in the U. S., a clinically meaningful benefit was demonstrated by higher response to NurOwn® compared with placebo.  NurOwn® is not currently approved in the United States, Israel or elsewhere.  There is no guaranty that this treatment will be effective or that there will not be any adverse effects for patients as a result of this treatment.
 
As previously announced, Brainstorm plans to conduct additional clinical trials with the goal of obtaining regulatory approval for NurOwn® in the United States and other major markets.
 
Patients interested in participating in this program to achieve early access to NurOwn®, should click on this link and provide their information.

July 24--Israeli stem cell developer Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:BCLI) has been awarded a $16 million grant by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). The grant will support a pivotal Phase III study of NurOwn, for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Based in Petah Tikva and Hackensack, New Jersey, Brainstorm develops adult stem cell technologies for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) has awarded Brainstorm a grant of $16 million to
The grant from CIRM is a significant endorsement of the potential for Brainstorm's novel approach to treat ALS using adult stem cells. CIRM is the world's largest institution dedicated to cell therapies.
"We are honored to be awarded this CIRM grant, and appreciate the support of CIRM in the development of NurOwn," said Chaim Lebovits, President and CEO of Brainstorm. "This substantial award provides further support for our technology and clinical program, and recognizes the importance of developing effective treatments for patients afflicted with ALS."
Dr. Maria Millan, interim President and CEO of CIRM said, "ALS is a devastating disease with an average life expectancy of less than five years and individuals afflicted with this condition suffer an extreme loss in quality of life. They lose the ability to walk, dress themselves, speak, swallow and breathe. CIRM is partnering with Brainstorm to follow up on the Company's promising phase II trial in patients with ALS. CIRM's mission is to accelerate stem cell treatments to patients with unmet medical needs and, in keeping with this mission, our objective is to find a treatment for patients ravaged by this neurologic condition for which there is currently no cure."
Brainstorm is in the advanced stages of planning a Phase III clinical trial investigating NurOwn in ALS. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 200 patients and will be conducted at 6 top ALS clinical sites in the US. The primary outcome measure will be the ALSFR-S score responder analysis. The patient population will be optimized to include faster-progressing patients who demonstrated superior outcomes in the NurOwn Phase II ALS trial.
Brainstorm is yet to generate any revenue. The company's share price was up 9% on Friday, giving Brainstorm a market cap of $92.5 million.

July 24--Israeli stem cell developer Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:BCLI) has been awarded a $16 million grant by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). The grant will support a pivotal Phase III study of NurOwn, for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Based in Petah Tikva and Hackensack, New Jersey, Brainstorm develops adult stem cell technologies for neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) has awarded Brainstorm a grant of $16 million to
The grant from CIRM is a significant endorsement of the potential for Brainstorm's novel approach to treat ALS using adult stem cells. CIRM is the world's largest institution dedicated to cell therapies.
"We are honored to be awarded this CIRM grant, and appreciate the support of CIRM in the development of NurOwn," said Chaim Lebovits, President and CEO of Brainstorm. "This substantial award provides further support for our technology and clinical program, and recognizes the importance of developing effective treatments for patients afflicted with ALS."
Dr. Maria Millan, interim President and CEO of CIRM said, "ALS is a devastating disease with an average life expectancy of less than five years and individuals afflicted with this condition suffer an extreme loss in quality of life. They lose the ability to walk, dress themselves, speak, swallow and breathe. CIRM is partnering with Brainstorm to follow up on the Company's promising phase II trial in patients with ALS. CIRM's mission is to accelerate stem cell treatments to patients with unmet medical needs and, in keeping with this mission, our objective is to find a treatment for patients ravaged by this neurologic condition for which there is currently no cure."
Brainstorm is in the advanced stages of planning a Phase III clinical trial investigating NurOwn in ALS. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 200 patients and will be conducted at 6 top ALS clinical sites in the US. The primary outcome measure will be the ALSFR-S score responder analysis. The patient population will be optimized to include faster-progressing patients who demonstrated superior outcomes in the NurOwn Phase II ALS trial.
Brainstorm is yet to generate any revenue. The company's share price was up 9% on Friday, giving Brainstorm a market cap of $92.5 million.

About the World Advanced Therapies & Regenerative Medicine Congress12 years ago when the World Stem Cells Congress was launched, the stem cells sector was one of scientific interest.  Focusing on the challenges of how to transform these little precursor cells eventually into new tissues and organs. The first stem cells conference was relatively small with only 80 people attending the first event, but we knew we were on the verge of something huge and exciting.  In May 2017 the newly named World Advanced Therapies & Regenerative Medicine Congress, will bring together 800+ attendees and explore the rapidly developing world of ATMPs (Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products). From process development to clinical translation this congress will bring you the most exciting case studies and new data. Experts in every area will help you tackle the process and regulatory hurdles of developing these new therapeutic formats all the way through manufacture and into the clinic.

(BCLI), a leading developer of adult stem cell technologies for neurodegenerative diseases, announced today that is has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with The Medical Research, Infrastructure, and Health Services Fund of the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) to explore the possibility of making NurOwn® available to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients under the provisions of  Hospital Exemption regulation.  The MOU also covers the participation of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in the planned Phase 3 trial that will investigate NurOwn in ALS.    The MOU sets forth the basic terms under which Brainstorm and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center would work together to submit an application to the Israeli Ministry of Health that will allow patient access to NurOwn and is subject to a definitive agreement.  The agreement is expected to be formalized in the first half of 2017."We are pleased to be working with Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and look forward to putting a definitive agreement in place," said Chaim Lebovits, President and CEO of BrainStorm.  "We believe that NurOwn meets the requirements to be a Hospital Exempt product and, if our application is successful, we could potentially make the product available to patients prior to obtaining formal licensure."     "Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and BrainStorm have a joint interest in developing  a path to bring  advanced therapies to patients," said Professor Ronni Gamzu, CEO of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. "We hope our combined efforts will leverage BrainStorm's technology to provide a new and innovative treatment option for our ALS patients."About Hospital ExemptionThe Israeli Ministry of Health (MoH) has recently adopted a policy that was developed in Europe in regards to advanced medical therapies, under which a Hospital Exemption (HE) Regulation was put in place.  The new MoH guidelines, which are similar to the HE rules applied in the European Union, require Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics to partner with a local medical center in order to apply for HE.About Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov) is the second largest and one of the most progressive full-service healthcare treatment and research institutions in Israel. The Medical Center draws patients from throughout the world for specialty care and routine procedures, designed specifically for the needs of international patients.  Medical Center physicians integrate their clinical care with research on a daily basis. The Medical Center is the leading hospital in Israel in the number of research projects conducted.  Each year, hundreds of research studies, both basic science and clinical, are conducted within the Medical Center's walls, in search of new medical understanding and to develop new diagnostic and treatment modalities.

	Cell Therapeutics Ltd. (“BCT”), an Israeli Company which currently conducts all of the research and development activities
	of the Company, and Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics UK Ltd. (“Brainstorm UK”). Brainstorm UK acts on behalf of the parent
	Company in the EU. Brainstorm UK is currently inactive. The Common Stock is publicly traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under
	the symbol “BCLI”.





	 







	B.



	The Company, through BCT, holds rights to commercialize certain
	stem cell technology developed by Ramot of Tel Aviv University Ltd. (“Ramot”) (see Note 3). Using this technology the
	Company has been developing novel adult stem cell therapies for debilitating neurodegenerative disorders such as Amytrophic Lateral
	Scelorosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gherig Disease), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s disease. The Company developed
	a proprietary process, called NurOwn, for the propagation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and their differentiation into neurotrophic
	factor secreting cells. These cells are then transplanted at or near the site of damage, offering the hope of more effectively
	treating neurodegenerative diseases.


	The process is currently autologous, or self-transplanted.






	 







	C.



	NurOwn is in clinical development for the treatment of ALS. The
	Company has completed two single dose clinical trials of NurOwn in Israel, a phase 1/2 trial with 12 patients and a phase 2a trial
	with additional 12 patients. In July 2016 the Company announced the results of its phase 2 trial which was conducted in three major
	medical centers in the US. This single dose trial included 48 patients randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive NuOwn or placebo. Future
	development of NurOwn for ALS will require additional clinical trials typically required to provide an adequate basis for regulatory
	approval and product labeling. These additional trials will include the administration of repeated doses to ALS patients enrolled
	in these trials.





	 




	 




	D.





	On September 15, 2014 the Company completed a reverse stock split of the Company’s shares of Common Stock by a ratio 1-for-15. The Company adjusted all ordinary shares, options, warrants, per share data and exercise prices included in these financial statements for all periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split. On August 26, 2015 the shareholders of the Company approved a reduction of the number of authorized shares of Common Stock of the Company from 800,000,000 to 100,000,000.





	 



	GOING CONCERN:




	 



	To date the Company has not generated
	revenues from its activities and has incurred substantial operating losses. Management expects the Company to continue to generate
	substantial operating losses and to continue to fund its operations primarily through utilization of its current financial resources
	and through additional raises of capital.


	 


	Such conditions raise substantial
	doubts about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plan includes raising funds from outside
	potential investors. However, there is no assurance such funding will be available to the Company or that it will be obtained on
	terms favorable to the Company or will provide the Company with sufficient funds to meet its objectives. These financial statements
	do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets, carrying amounts or the amount and
	classification of liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	Unaudited Interim Financial Statements





	 




	The
	accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
	principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of U.S.
	Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required
	by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered
	necessary for a fair presentation have been included (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise discussed).
	For further information, reference is made to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s
	Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.




	 




	Operating
	results for the three months ended March 31, 2017, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
	ended December 31, 2017.

	Significant Accounting Policies




	 



	The
	significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
	are identical to those applied in the preparation of the latest annual financial statements.




	 







	C.


	Recent Accounting Standards




	 


	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board issued a new standard to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the U.S., resulting in
	a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Under the new
	model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the
	consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard
	requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts
	with customers. The new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018; early adoption is prohibited. The
	new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative
	effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. As the Company has not incurred revenues to date,
	it is unable to determine to expected impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In January 2016, the FASB issued
	an amended standard requiring changes to recognition and measurement of certain financial assets and liabilities. The standard
	primarily affects equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements
	for financial instruments. This standard is effective beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Certain provisions allow for early
	adoption. The Company do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on the financial position
	or results of operations.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued
	a new lease accounting standard requiring that we recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. This standard is
	effective beginning in the first quarter of 2019; early adoption is permitted. The Company have not yet determined the impact of
	the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

	C.


	Recent Accounting Standards (Cont.):




	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued
	an accounting standard update aimed at simplifying the accounting for share-based payment transactions. Included in the update
	are modifications to the accounting for income taxes upon vesting or settlement of awards, employer tax withholding on shared-based
	compensation, forfeitures, and financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits. This standard is effective beginning in
	the first quarter of 2017; early adoption is permitted. The Company do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have
	a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations.


	 


	In June 2016, the FASB issued a
	new standard requiring measurement and recognition of expected credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. It also
	modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased
	financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. This standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2020;
	early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and we are evaluating whether we will early adopt. It is required
	to be applied on a modified-retrospective approach with certain elements being adopted prospectively. The Company does not expect
	that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations.



	 







	D.


	Use of estimates




	 



	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates.




	 



	NOTE 3    -    RESEARCH

	Ramot pursuant to which Ramot agreed to an amended payment schedule regarding the Company’s payment obligations under the Research
	and License Agreement and waived all claims against the Company resulting from the Company’s previous defaults and non-payment
	under the Research and License Agreement. The waiver and release amended and restated the original payment schedule under the original
	agreement providing for payments during the initial research period and additional payments for any extended research period.




	 




	The
	Company is to pay Ramot royalties on Net Sales on a Licensed Product by Licensed Product and jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis
	as follows:

	b)



	In the event the making, producing, manufacturing, using, marketing,
	selling, importing or exporting of such Licensed Product is not covered by a Valid Claim and not covered by Orphan Drug status
	in such jurisdiction – 3% of all Net Sales until the expiration of 15 years from the date of the First Commercial Sale of
	such Licensed Product in such jurisdiction.






	 



	NOTE 4    -    SHORT
	TERM INVESTMENTS



	 




	Short
	term investments on March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include bank deposits bearing annual interest rates varying from 0.15%
	to 1.48%, with maturities of up to 1 and 6 months as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

	per share) and three year warrants to purchase 1,176,471 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $3.75 per share (the “2013
	Warrants”). The Warrants also included, subject to certain exceptions, full ratchet anti-dilution protection in the event
	of the issuance of any Common Stock, securities convertible into common stock, or certain other issuances at a price below the
	then-current exercise price of the Warrants, which would result in an adjustment to the exercise price of the Warrants. After deducting
	closing costs and fees, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $3.3 million. In accordance with the provisions
	of ASC 815 (formerly FAS 133) the proceeds related to the warrants at the amount of $829 were recorded to liabilities at the fair

	of Company common stock, in consideration for approximately $600 payable in cash ($1.80 per Warrant).


	 


	In May 2014,
	certain holders of 2013 Warrants which did not participate in the redemption and whose 2013 Warrants will therefore remained outstanding
	waived the anti-dilution provisions of their 2013 Warrants.


	 


	In July 2014,
	the Company agreed to adjust the exercise price of the remaining “2013 Warrants” to $0.525 per share.


	 


	On January 6,
	2015, the remaining “2013 Warrants” holders that did not provide a waiver of their anti-dilution rights, exercised
	their warrants. Therefore, the liability related to the 2013 Warrants has been cancelled.

	Company Overview  



	 


	Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. is an
	integrated biotechnology company actively engaged in the development and commercialization of innovative adult stem cell therapies
	for the treatment of debilitating neurodegenerative disorders that have no or limited treatment options, thus representing a unique
	opportunity to address unmet medical needs. These include Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (“ALS”, also known as Lou Gehrig’s
	disease), Multiple Sclerosis (“MS”), and Parkinson’s disease (“PD”) among others. NurOwn® is
	our proprietary process for the propagation of adult bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (“MSC”), their differentiation
	into neurotrophic factor-(“NTF”) secreting cells (“MSC-NTF”), and transplantation at, or close to, the site
	of damage.


	 


	Evidence to date from published animal
	and human studies suggest that NurOwn

	Ò

	offers the potential for more effective
	treatment of neurodegenerative diseases relative to existing therapies through unique neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects.
	Groundbreaking ALS CSF biomarker work has demonstrated a strongly correlated increase in neurotrophic factors and a reduction in
	inflammatory biomarkers (MCP-1 and SDF-1) in NurOwn

	Ò

	-treated and not in placebo
	treated participants. This is a clear indicator of the mechanism by which this technology acts in ALS, and in related neurodegenerative
	diseases.


	 


	Our core technology was developed in collaboration
	with Professor (Prof.) Daniel Offen (Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Tel Aviv University), and the late Prof. Eldad Melamed
	, former head of Neurology of the Rabin Medical Center and former member of the Scientific Committee of the Michael J. Fox Foundation
	for Parkinson’s Research. Our wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary, Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd. (the “Israeli Subsidiary”),
	holds rights to commercialize the technology, through a licensing agreement with Ramot at Tel Aviv University Ltd. (“Ramot”),
	the technology transfer company of Tel Aviv University, Israel. We currently employ 21 employees in Israel and 2 in the United
	States.


	 



	Our Proprietary Technology




	 



	Facilitated by NurOwn® technology,
	the differentiated MSC-NTF cells are capable of releasing several highly disease relevant neurotrophic factors, including Glial-derived
	neurotrophic factor (“GDNF”), Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (“BDNF”), Vascular endothelial growth factor
	(“VEGF”) and Hepatocyte growth factor (“HGF”), all critical for the growth, survival and differentiation
	of developing neurons. GDNF is one of the most potent factors involved in the protection and survival of peripheral neurons. VEGF
	and HGF have been reported to have important protective effects on neurons and other non-neuronal glial cells in ALS as well as
	other neurodegenerative diseases. The effects of neurotrophic factors on neurons may include:


	 




	 



	·




	Protection of existing motor neurons;





	 



	·




	Promotion of motor neuron growth; and





	 



	·




	Re-establishment of functional nerve-muscle interaction.





	 







	24

	 





	 




	 



	In
	addition to the consistent and important release of neurotrophic factors, NurOwn


	Ò


	demonstrates consistent

	in vitro


	modification
	of the immune response



	(


	immunomodulation)
	and

	in vivo

	modulation of CSF biomarkers. Neuroinflammation is an important cause of disease progression in neurodegenerative
	diseases, including ALS. The proprietary NurOwn


	Ò


	process
	results in significant measurable differences from undifferentiated MSCs, including: enhanced release of neurotrophic factors;
	release of neurotrophic factors that are very low or not expressed by MSCs; and a unique micro-RNA profile that may regulate growth
	and development of neurons (neurogenesis), VEGF and neuroinflammation. In preclinical studies, NurOwn


	Ò


	was found to be more effective than MSC in treating Autism,
	Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis. The combination of enhanced NTF release and neuromodulation
	may be an optimal approach to restore function and reduce ongoing CNS tissue damage in neurodegenerative disease.



	 



	NurOwn


	Ò


	treatment is a multi-step process (see table below) beginning with harvesting
	of undifferentiated stem cells from the patient’s own bone marrow, and concluding with transplantation of the resulting differentiated,
	neurotrophic factor-secreting mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-NTF) back into the patient – intrathecally (injection into the
	cerebrospinal fluid) by standard lumbar puncture and/or intramuscularly. This unique technology is the first-of-its-kind for the
	treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.



	 



	The NurOwn® Transplantation Process




	 





	 



	·




	Bone marrow aspiration from patient;





	 



	·




	Isolation and propagation of the patient’s mesenchymal stem cells;





	 



	·




	Differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells into neurotrophic-factor secreting (MSC-NTF) cells; and





	 



	·




	Autologous transplantation into the same patient’s spinal cord and/or muscle tissue.





	  


	Our proprietary technology process is conducted
	in full compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”). It is licensed to and developed by our Israeli
	Subsidiary.


	 





	Advances
	of NurOwn






	Ò


	Beyond
	Current Therapies




	 


	- Patient Benefits







	 




	Given that NurOwn®’s approach
	involves transplantation of the stem cells derived from the same patient (autologous), there is no risk of rejection and no need
	for treatment with immunosuppressive agents, which can cause severe and/or long-term side effects. In addition, the use of adult
	stem cells precludes the controversy associated with the use of embryonic stem cells in some countries.


	 



	Patients
	received NurOwn


	Ò


	in
	a single administration in the Phase 2 study. The Phase 3 program will involve multiple doses (3) that may be repeated 6 months
	later, whereas other therapies require multiple daily oral or intravenous administration.



	 


	MSC can be cryopreserved and, as required,
	can be subsequently differentiated into NurOwn®, and demonstrate product characteristics like NurOwn

	®

	 cells
	derived from fresh MSC of the same patient/donor. This will allow the Company to provide repeated doses of autologous NurOwn® from
	a single bone marrow aspirate in its upcoming multi-dose clinical trial and will avoid the need for patients to undergo repeated
	bone marrow aspiration for a 2-year period.


	 



	The ALS Program



	 



	Phase 1/2 and Phase 2a clinical studies
	for ALS patients



	 


	The clinical development program for NurOwn®
	in ALS has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for this indication,
	and has been granted Orphan Status in both the United States and in Europe. We have completed two clinical trials of NurOwn®
	in patients with ALS at Hadassah Medical Center (“Hadassah”) (Principal Investigator (PI)- Professor (Prof.) Dimitrios
	Karussis). Laboratory services for of NurOwn® studies for the Israeli Subsidiary have been provided by Hadassah through an
	agreement with Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd., a subsidiary of the Hadassah Medical Organization.


	 


	A Phase 1/2 safety and efficacy study of
	NurOwn® in ALS patients administered either intramuscularly or intrathecally, was initiated in June 2011 after receiving approval
	from the Israeli Ministry of Health (“MoH”). The trial results, which were presented by Prof. Karussis at the American
	Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting on March 2013, demonstrated the safety of NurOwn® as well as signs of ALS patient functional
	improvement, as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Score (“ALSFRS-R”) and improved breathing, as measured by the
	Forced Vital Capacity (“FVC”).


	 



	A
	Phase 2a combined (intramuscular and intrathecal) treatment, dose-escalating trial, approved by the Israeli MoH in January 2013,
	was also conducted at Hadassah (PI- Prof. Dimitrios Karussis) and by September 27, 2013, we announced that 12 patients had successfully
	completed treatment. On December 10, 2013 Prof. Karussis presented some of the preliminary findings from this trial at the 24

	th

	 International
	Symposium on ALS/MND in Milan, Italy, followed in June 2014 by the interim data of the trial, at the Joint Congress of European
	Neurology in Istanbul, Turkey. The last follow-up visits in this study occurred in September 2014. On January 5, 2015, the Company
	presented final top line data from this study in a press release and investor conference call. The results of this study confirmed
	the safety profile observed in the earlier Phase 1/2 trial, with the clear majority of adverse events being low-grade and transient.
	There were two deaths and two serious adverse events, all of which were deemed by the investigators to be unrelated to treatment.
	Subjects in this study showed a meaningful reduction in the rate of disease progression for the three and six months after treatment,
	compared to the three months prior to treatment. This confirmed the safety of intrathecal administration of NurOwn


	Ò


	in ALS.



	 



	In
	January 2016, the Company announced the publication of a paper in the January 2016 edition of JAMA Neurology based
	on the results of the first in man Phase 1/2 study and Phase 2 dose escalation study with NurOwn® in ALS. The data provide
	indication of clinically meaningful benefit as reflected by a slower rate of ALS disease progression following NurOwn


	Ò


	treatment, a positive trend on two ALS disease biomarkers, including rate
	of decline of muscle volume and electrical muscle function. This was the first published clinical data with NurOwn


	Ò


	,
	or any treatment, to achieve a neuroprotective effect in ALS and potentially modify the course of disease.



	 



	In April
	2016, the Company presented the combined results of the Phase 1/2 and Phase 2a NurOwn


	Ò


	clinical studies in ALS at the ISRASTEM 2016 and 6th Israel Stem
	Cell Society (ISCS) joint annual meeting which took place in Tel Aviv, Israel.

	an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the FDA for NurOwn® in ALS, and on April 28, 2014, we initiated
	an FDA-approved randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center U.S. Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating NurOwn® in
	ALS patients. The trial was conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital (PIs- Drs. Merit Cudkowicz and James Berry) in Boston,
	Massachusetts, at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital (PI- Dr. Robert Brown) in Worcester, Massachusetts and at the
	Mayo Clinic (Drs. Anthony Windebank and Nathan Staff) in Rochester, Minnesota. For this study, NurOwn® was manufactured at
	the Connell and O’Reilly Cell Manipulation Core Facility at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts and
	at the Human Cellular Therapy Lab at the Mayo Clinic. In the study 48 patients were randomized 3:1 to receive NurOwn® or placebo.


	 


	In February 2015, the Company announced
	that the Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) for the multi-center U.S. Phase 2 clinical trial had reviewed the safety
	data collected through a cutoff date in January 2015, and did not find any significant lab abnormalities, adverse events or significant
	protocol deviations that would be cause for concern and therefore approved continuation of the trial as planned.


	 


	On August 11, 2015, the Company announced
	that it had completed enrollment achieving the target of 48 subjects to be enrolled in its ongoing randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled
	Phase 2 clinical trial of NurOwn® in ALS. The Company further announced, in November 2015, that the DSMB review of the
	safety data collected through a cutoff date in October 2015 for the multi-center U.S. Phase 2 clinical trial indicated that 47
	of the 48 patients enrolled in the study confirmed that they experienced no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs). 
	Furthermore, the DSMB did not identify any significant adverse events, lab abnormalities or significant protocol deviations that
	would be cause for concern. 


	 


	In July 2016, the Company announced topline
	data from the recently completed U.S. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study of NurOwn® in ALS which confirmed
	that the study achieved its primary objective, demonstrating that NurOwn

	®

	was safe and well tolerated.  NurOwn

	®

	also achieved multiple secondary efficacy endpoints, showing clear evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit.  Notably,
	response rates were higher for NurOwn

	®

	-treated subjects compared to placebo at all time points in the study out
	to 24 weeks. 


	 


	In October 2016, some of the Company’s
	topline phase 2 ALS clinical trial results were presented by Dr. Robert Brown and Dr. James Berry, at the 15th Annual Meeting of
	the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS).


	  



	In
	December 2016, the Company announced that data from the Company’s Phase 2 study of NurOwn

	®

	 in ALS, would be
	highlighted in presentations at the 27th International Symposium on ALS/MND, being held December 7-9, 2016 in Dublin,
	Ireland. Lead investigator, Dr. James Berry, presented new data from the Phase 2 study demonstrating that in ALS patients
	treated with NurOwn


	Ò


	,
	CSF neurotrophic factors (VEGF, HGF and LIF) showed a statistically significant increase and correlated with a statistically significant
	decrease in CSF inflammatory markers (MCP-1 and SDF-1) two weeks post-transplantation compared to pre-transplantation.   In
	addition, reductions in CSF inflammatory markers at two weeks post-transplantation correlated with improvements in ALSFRS-R slope
	at 12 weeks post-transplantation, consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of NurOwn


	Ò


	in ALS. Dr. Berry also presented the pre-specified responder analyses
	from the Phase 2 trial which examined percentage improvements in post treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating
	Scale (ALSFRS-R) slope compared to pre-treatment slope. These analyses showed that, in the NurOwn® treated group, a greater
	number of patients achieved the high threshold of 100% or greater improvement in the post-treatment vs. pre-treatment slope, compared
	with the placebo group.  Responders were defined as those in whom disease symptoms were essentially halted for the period
	of the treatment effect or those who achieved a positive improvement on their ALSFRS-R score.  Moreover, in the pre-specified
	subgroup that excluded subjects whose disease was progressing slowly, this effect was even more pronounced. Dr. Berry’s presentation
	was posted on the Company website.



	  



	Phase 3 Clinical Study for ALS Patients 



	 


	In December 2016, the Company announced
	that it had recently completed a successful End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
	The Company reached general agreement with the FDA to proceed to a Phase 3 trial. Importantly, the FDA accepted
	the key elements of the Phase 3 program to support a Biologic License Application (BLA) for NurOwn® in ALS. The planned
	Phase 3 clinical trial will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-dose trial that will be conducted at multiple
	sites in the U.S. and in Israel. The trial is expected to begin enrolling patients in the second quarter of 2017.


	 


	In January 2017, the Company announced
	that it had validated its cryopreservation process for NurOwn® in preparation for the upcoming Phase 3 clinical study
	in ALS.  The validation involved a comparison of NurOwn® (MSC-NTF cells) derived from fresh mesenchymal stem cells
	(MSC) to those derived from cryopreserved MSC.  Company scientists were successful in showing that the MSC can be stored in
	the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen for prolonged periods of time while maintaining their characteristics.  The cryopreserved
	MSC can differentiate into NurOwn®, similar to the NurOwn

	®

	 derived from fresh MSC of the same patient/donor,
	prior to cryopreservation. This will allow the Company to provide repeated doses of autologous NurOwn® from a single bone
	marrow aspirate in its upcoming multi-dose clinical trial. Cryopreservation will avoid the need for patients to undergo repeated
	bone marrow aspirations.

	In February 2017, the Company announced
	that it plans to contract with City of Hope’s Center for Biomedicine and Genetics to produce clinical supplies of NurOwn®
	adult stem cells for the company’s planned randomized, double-blind, multi-dose Phase 3 clinical study in patients with ALS. 
	City of Hope is expected to support all U.S. medical centers that will be participating in the Phase 3 trial. 


	 


	Future development of NurOwn® in ALS
	will require additional clinical trials, including a Phase 3 FDA-approved multi dose trial. 


	 



	Patient Access Programs 



	 


	In December 2016, the Company announced
	that it plans to apply for Hospital Exemption for NurOwn® in Israel that will allow patient access to NurOwn® as
	a treatment that has been granted Hospital Exemption. This recently approved pathway would permit the Company to partner with a
	medical center in Israel and be allowed to treat patients with NurOwn® for a fee. Hospital Exemption allows
	for advanced therapy medicinal products to be made available to a group of patients to be agreed upon by the Israeli Ministry
	of Health. It is intended to provide patients with the possibility to benefit from a custom-made, innovative, individual treatment
	where there is a critical unmet need and an absence of valid therapeutic alternatives. The treatment is usually a custom-made product,
	such as NurOwn®, manufactured using a patient’s own cells that are prepared on a non-routine basis. To qualify for a Hospital
	Exemption, several important criteria must be met including preparation according to specific quality standards (equivalent to
	those for a licensed product), use in a hospital and use under the exclusive responsibility of a medical practitioner.


	 


	In March 2017, the Company announced that
	it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with The Medical Research, Infrastructure, and Health Services Fund
	of the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) to explore the possibility of making NurOwn® available to Amyotrophic
	Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients under the provisions of Hospital Exemption regulation.  The MOU also covers the participation
	of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in the planned Phase 3 trial that will investigate NurOwn® in ALS.    The
	MOU sets forth the basic terms under which the Company and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center would work together to submit
	an application to the Israeli Ministry of Health that will allow patient access to NurOwn® and is subject to a definitive
	agreement.  The agreement is expected to be formalized in the first half of 2017


	 


	In February 2017, the Company announced
	that it has signed an agreement with CCRM, a Toronto-based leader in developing and commercializing regenerative medicine
	technologies, and cell and gene therapies, to support the market authorization request for NurOwn®.   At this time,
	CCRM is assisting the Company as it explores the opportunity to access Health Canada’s early access pathway for treatment
	of patients with ALS.  If NurOwn® qualifies for Health Canada’s “Notice of Compliance with Conditions”
	pathway it could be authorized in Canada for distribution in early 2018.


	 

	 




	Funding



	 


	In May 2016, the Company announced that for the ninth consecutive
	year its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd., was awarded a new grant of approximately $1,470,000 from Israel’s Office
	of the Chief Scientist (OCS). The Office of the Chief Scientist, is part of the Ministry of Economy Program to
	support innovative technologies in Israel. The funds supported the development of NurOwn

	®

	Phase 2 clinical
	program in ALS.


	 

	 




	Intellectual Property



	 


	In October 2016, the Company announced
	that it has been granted United States Patent No. 9,474,787 titled “Mesenchymal Stem Cells for the Treatment of CNS Diseases.
	The allowed claims cover mesenchymal stem cells that secrete neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor
	(BDNF) and glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), as well as a pharmaceutical composition comprising these factors.


	  



	Future Development Plans




	 



	In addition to its active clinical
	program in ALS, the Company is focusing on further in-depth molecular characterization of NurOwn® and its adaptation to additional
	indications. The Company is reviewing the potential clinical development of NurOwn® in other neurodegenerative disorders, such
	as Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. More research is currently being done on developing
	an additional product which might be suitable for many neurodegenerative diseases. 


	 


	Brainstorm is pursuing studies to explore
	the potential benefit of NurOwn

	Ò

	in autism, a poorly understood disorder of brain
	development that affects 1% of the worldwide population and for which there are no approved
	drug treatments. In April 2017, the Company announced the Publication of the NurOwn® Autism Research Study, entitled
	“Long Term Beneficial Effect of Neurotrophic Factors-Secreting Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation in the BTBR Mouse Model
	of Autism,” (Perets N. et al. Behav Brain Res. 2017 Apr 6. [Epub ahead of print] PMID: 28392323) showing that transplantation
	of NurOwn® in the BTBR mice demonstrated significant long-term improvements in autistic behavior in the BTBR mice compared
	to MSC treated and to untreated BTBR mice.


	 


	In addition, the Company is engaged in
	several research initiatives to improve the scale and efficiency of NurOwn® production and to improve the stability of NurOwn®,
	which is currently produced in clean room facilities close to the clinical trial sites, where the cells are administered to patients.


	 



	Management 



	 


	In March 2016, the Company announced the
	appointment of Ralph Z. Kern, MD, MHSc to the positions of Chief Operating Officer and Chief Medical Officer, effective March
	6, 2017. Dr. Kern joins Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics from Biogen, where he was Senior Vice President and Head of Worldwide
	Medical. His previous industry appointments include Head of Neuroscience Medical Unit at Novartis and Global Medical
	Director of Personalized Genetic Health at Genzyme Corporation.

	Results of Operations



	 


	For the period from inception (September 22, 2000) until March
	31, 2017, the Company has not earned any revenues from operations. The Company does not expect to earn revenues from operations
	until 2018, if ever. The Company has incurred operating costs and other expenses of approximately $1,770,000 during the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 compared to 1,812,000 during the three months through March 31, 2016.


	  



	Research and Development Expenses:



	 


	Research and development expenses, net for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $941,000 and $986,000, respectively, representing a decrease of $45,000. This decrease is due
	to a decrease of $222,000 for costs of activities related to the U.S. Clinical Trial, offset by an increase of $177,000 for costs
	associated with the clinical trial, planned to be conducted in Israel, payroll and a net increase of other research and development
	expenses.


	 



	General and Administrative Expenses:



	 


	General and administrative expenses for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $829,000 and $826,000, respectively. The increase in general and administrative
	expenses of $3,000 is primarily due to: a decrease of $ 160,000 in stock-based compensation expenses offset by a net increase of
	$163,000 of other costs.



	 




	Other Income and Expenses:



	 


	Financial expenses for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 was $15,000 as compared to financial income of $22,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	 



	Net Loss:



	 


	Net loss for the three months ended on
	March 31, 2017 was $1,785,000, as compared to a net loss of $1,790,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Net loss per
	share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.10.


	 


	The weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in
	computing basic and diluted net loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 18,688,377, compared to 18,653,804
	for the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	  



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	The Company has financed its operations
	since inception primarily through public and private sales of its Common Stock and warrants and the issuance of convertible promissory
	notes. At March 31, 2017, the Company had net working capital of $7,936,000 including cash, cash equivalents and short term bank
	deposits amounting to $8,347,000.


	 


	Net cash used in operating activities was
	$1,642,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Cash used for operating activities was primarily attributed to cost of rent
	of clean rooms and materials for clinical trials, payroll costs, rent, outside legal fee expenses and public relations expenses.
	Net cash provided by investing activities was $1,699,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, representing net change in
	short term interest bearing bank deposits. There were no financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017.


	 


	On June 4, 2015, we filed a shelf registration
	statement, effective June 10, 2015, relating to Common Stock, warrants and units that we may sell from time to time in one or more
	offerings, up to a total dollar amount of $100,000,000. We have not filed any supplemental prospectus defining particular terms
	of securities to be offered under the shelf registration statement.


	 





	28

	 





	 




	  


	Our material cash needs for the next 24
	months, assuming we do not expand our clinical trials beyond the upcoming multi dose clinical trial in Israel, will include (i)
	costs of the clinical trial in the U.S. (ii) employee salaries, (iii) costs expected for the upcoming multi-dose clinical trial
	in Israel, (iv) payments to Hadassah for rent and operation of the GMP facilities, and (v) fees to our consultants and legal advisors,
	patents, and fees for facilities to be used in our research and development.


	 


	Future operations are expected to be highly
	capital intensive and may require substantial capital raisings. We expect our current cash position will allow us to meet our obligations
	throughout second quarter of 2018 including the initiation of a Phase 3 trial that will include 200 patients in the upcoming 24
	months (assuming the multi dose clinical trial will include 24 patients and will not be expanded into a power trial).


	 


	Over the longer term if we are not able
	to raise substantial additional capital, we may not be able to continue to function as a going concern and may have to cease operations
	or the Company will reduce its costs, including curtailing its current plan to pursue larger clinical trials in ALS and move new
	indications into clinical testing. We will be required to raise a substantial amount of capital in the future in order to reach
	profitability and to complete the commercialization of our products. Our ability to fund these future capital requirements will
	depend on many factors, including the following: 


	 




	 



	•




	our ability to obtain funding from third parties, including any future collaborative partners;





	 




	 



	•




	the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development programs;





	 




	 



	•




	the time and costs required to gain regulatory approvals;





	 




	 



	•




	the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish;





	 




	 



	•




	the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patents, patent applications, patent claims, trademarks and other intellectual property rights;





	 




	 



	•




	the effect of competition and market developments; and





	 




	 



	•




	future pre-clinical and clinical trial results.





	 



	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

	 


	 


	Our discussion and analysis of our financial
	condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates,
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We continually
	evaluate our judgments, estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on the terms of underlying agreements, our expected course
	of development, historical experience and other factors we believe are reasonable based on the circumstances, the results of which
	form our management’s basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily
	apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.


	 


	There were no significant changes to our
	critical accounting policies during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. For information about critical accounting policies, see the
	discussion of critical accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.


	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have no off balance sheet arrangements
	that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
	condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.



	 







	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
	Disclosures About Market Risk.

	Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company.



	 







	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.



	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
	Procedures



	 


	As of the end of the period covered by
	this quarterly report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
	and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
	and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Based on this evaluation,
	our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective,
	as of the end of the period covered by this report, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we
	file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
	and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that the information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated
	and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
	allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	There have been no changes in our internal
	controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably
	likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.




	 







	PART II: OTHER INFORMATION



	 







	Item 1. Legal Proceedings.




	 



	From time to time, we may become involved
	in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business, which we consider routine and incidental
	to our business. We currently are not a party to any material legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management’s
	opinion, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition.



	 







	Item 1A. Risk Factors.




	 



	There have not been any material changes
	from the risk factors previously disclosed in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you
	should carefully consider the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, which
	could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
	for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known
	to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or
	operating results.



	 







	Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
	Proceeds




	 



	None.

BrainStorm Announces MOU With Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center To Make NurOwn® Available To Patients As A Hospital Exemption Product









PR Newswire




Mar 1, 2017 6:45 AM EST













 


















































  HACKENSACK, N.J. and PETACH TIKVAH, Israel, March 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of adult stem cell technologies for neurodegenerative diseases, announced today that is has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with The Medical Research, Infrastructure, and Health Services Fund of the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) to explore the possibility of making NurOwn® available to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients under the provisions of  Hospital Exemption regulation.  The MOU also covers the participation of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in the planned Phase 3 trial that will investigate NurOwn in ALS.     The MOU sets forth the basic terms under which Brainstorm and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center would work together to submit an application to the Israeli Ministry of Health that will allow patient access to NurOwn and is subject to a definitive agreement.  The agreement is expected to be formalized in the first half of 2017. "We are pleased to be working with Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and look forward to putting a definitive agreement in place," said Chaim Lebovits, President and CEO of BrainStorm.  "We believe that NurOwn meets the requirements to be a Hospital Exempt product and, if our application is successful, we could potentially make the product available to patients prior to obtaining formal licensure."      "Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and BrainStorm have a joint interest in developing  a path to bring  advanced therapies to patients," said Professor Ronni Gamzu, CEO of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. "We hope our combined efforts will leverage BrainStorm's technology to provide a new and innovative treatment option for our ALS patients."

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35.

At Walmart, it's easy to find your favorite artists and albums, while discovering new ones, too. Shop some of the most popular categories like pop, rock, country, rap/hip-hop, R&B/soul and Christian/gospel. There s also dance and deejay music, Latin, classical, jazz, blues, movie soundtracks, even music DVDs and more. It s a seemingly endless collection of the best hits   from yesterday and today. Choosing your music Browse through the latest releases and preorder albums that are coming soon. You can also check out the list of current best sellers in any category or sort them by customer rating to see what s most popular with other music fans. There are even can t-miss deals that let you get more music for less money by finding older releases from your favorite artists at discount prices. Music for kids And don t forget the youngsters in your life. If you re searching for music for the kids to listen to   whether you re at home or on a road trip   choose from a wide variety of children's tunes. Singalong songs will keep your child occupied for hours while toddlers will be entertained with timeless classics that never fade. You ll enjoy sharing songs like  The Wheels on the Bus,   Mary Had a Little Lamb  and  I m a Little Teapot.  Wanna get moving? Look through the selection of dance recordings and rock to the beat. Celebrate with karaoke If you have a fun event coming up, check out the karaoke music selections, a perfect complement to parties and family gatherings if there ever was one. Try some country music, pop music, relive the music from the 80s and much more. Whatever the musical preference, there s a karaoke party waiting for you. Records and turntables Still got a thing for vinyl? It s OK. We get that. Satisfy that old-school itch and shop for records in a variety of categories or choose a bundled collection from select popular artists, both old and new. Then spin those RPMs just like you used to because some things should never go out of style. If you should need a record player to go with that vinyl, you can combine old and new technologies with a turntable that includes: an AM/FM radioa cassette playera CD player USB and Bluetooth technology An added USB connection let s you convert vinyl to digital media or Bluetooth technology will let you stream music from other, more modern devices   all with precisely the style you're going for. Throw it back with a vintage record player look or grab a unit that mimics the turntables in a trendy club. Mobile music Of course, you can also take the more modern-day approach and listen to your music on any mobile device, including iPads and tablets. Save the storage space around your house or in your car and go digital. A 16-gigabyte device can hold roughly 3,500 songs. That s a lot of music to listen to   conveniently. And if you want to bump it up to 64 gigs, you re looking at 15,000 songs. Now that s an impressive music collection. Give the gift of music Music makes a fantastic gift any time of the year, so consider making a wish list of albums you'd love and encouraging your family and friends to do the same. Or, simply give them an electronic gift card. iTunes e-gifts are incredibly thoughtful and handy and come in a variety of denominations, from $10 to $100. These unique codes are provided via email and are perfect for anyone who likes apps, games, music, movies, television shows, books and more. They can be used in the App Store, or with iTunes, iBooks   even toward an Apple Music membership, if desired. Google Play gift codes also provide access to the latest entertainment   whether it s music, movies, TV, books, magazines, apps or games. Let that special someone enjoy their favorite songs, flicks and more on any sized screen across Android, iOS and the web. There s also a Microsoft Groove Music pass, which provides instant access to millions of songs. Your music, your way With so many options, it has never been easier to listen to your favorite music. And with Walmart's Every Day low prices, there's no reason not to expand your music library and add to your loved one s collection, too. Save Money. Live Better.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332935, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
