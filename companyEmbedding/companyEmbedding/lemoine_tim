Who We Are
Based in Louisiana, The Lemoine Company is one of the most respected full‐service general contracting and construction management firms in the Southeast. Lemoine constructs and manages projects ranging from minor interior renovations to some of the most complex commercial, education, healthcare, public and industrial landmarks in the Gulf Region.
Founded by Lewis “Hoss” Lemoine in 1935 as The Cottonport Lumber Company, the organization remains family‐owned and operates today as The Lemoine Company. Son Tim Lemoine transitioned the organization into a general contracting and construction management firm in 1975, relocating the company to Lafayette, and broadening the organization’s geographical footprint. In 2001, younger brother Lenny Lemoine assumed the role of President and remains in this position today.
Throughout the years, our purpose has remained the same: To achieve excellence in construction while enhancing the lives of all involved. Lemoine employees stand behind this mission and ensure we achieve our purpose each day by delivering unparalleled customer service and building quality products, people, and relationships.

 
Our Core Values of Safety, People & Relationships, Ecstatic Customers, Integrity, Attention to Detail, Discipline, and Excellence are what guide us in our quest for excellence each and every day. In fact, we are certain that our reputation is one of our greatest assets. We know that our reputation is built each and every day by the way we treat our clients, design teams, and vendors.
