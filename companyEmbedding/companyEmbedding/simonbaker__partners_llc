 








Overview


























    


  




















In contrast to many wealth managers, we are not asset gatherers. SimonBaker&Partners is a multi-family office. We are Senior Wealth Advisors who are managers of financial managers. 
Each of our Senior Wealth Advisors is hands-on and personally accountable for all aspects of a client’s wealth management. There is no hand-off to junior staff.
Due to the level of personal involvement --- and the required depth of client understanding being a true proxy voice demands --- SimonBaker&Partners only accepts a small number of exceptional clients with investment assets of $20 million or more.

Family Office Overview































Contact Us
Request Info
Client Login





































For families of significant wealth (investment assets of $20 million or more), it can be burdensome to manage a collection of financial  and investment managers, bankers and accountants, among others.   A family office is a single business that plans, executes and manages all of a family’s financial affairs.  The best family offices act as a family’s most trusted financial advisor, focused on protecting and preserving family wealth over multiple generations. 
SimonBaker&Partners, LLC (SB&P) , is a SEC-registered, multi-family office that can help you manage your wealth more strategically. SB&P provides personal, hands-on service that you won’t find from the typical financial advisor.  As a fee-only advisor, SB&P is focused exclusively on your family’s interests rather than on selling any particular financial product or service.

We built the firm to address three major areas of concern among sophisticated wealthy clients.

Lack of Senior Level Attention.  The lack of promised hands-on involvement of the most senior- level people, coupled with the consistent delegation of responsibility to more junior individuals.
Conflicted Advice.  The prevalence of firms offering non-objective advice, particularly when selling their own financial products over perhaps other more relevant choices in the marketplace and rigid firm policies that prevent clients from getting the advice they need.
How Do I Optimize My Time?  The unhappiness of wealthy individuals or families of having to spend an inordinate amount of time having to manage their managers and referee among competing advisors.

SimonBaker & Partners LLC is an SEC registered investment adviser headquartered in San Francisco with offices located in Dallas, New York, and Palm Beach.
SimonBaker & Partners LLC and its investment adviser representatives are in compliance with the current filing requirements imposed upon SEC registered investment advisers by those states in which SimonBaker & Partners LLC maintains clients. SimonBaker & Partners LLC may only transact business in those states in which it is registered, or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from registration requirements. SimonBaker & Partners LLC’s website is limited to the dissemination of general information pertaining to its advisory services, together with access to additional investment-related information, publications, and links. Accordingly, the publication of SimonBaker & Partners LLC’s website on the Internet should not be construed by any consumer and/or prospective client as a solicitation to effect, or attempt to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation, over the Internet.
For information pertaining to the registration status of SimonBaker & Partners LLC, please contact the SEC or the state securities law administrators for those states in which SimonBaker & Partners LLC maintains a notice filing. A copy of SimonBaker & Partners LLC’s current written disclosure statement discussing its business operations, services, and fees is available upon written request.

All such information is provided solely for convenience purposes only and all users thereof should be guided accordingly.
Past performance may not be indicative of future results. Therefore, no current or prospective client should assume that future performance of any specific investment, investment strategy (including the investments and/or investment strategies recommended or undertaken by SimonBaker & Partners LLC) or product made reference to directly or indirectly by SimonBaker & Partners LLC on its Web site, or indirectly via a link to an unaffiliated third party Web site, will be profitable or equal the corresponding indicated performance level(s). Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will either be suitable or profitable for a client or prospective client’s investment portfolio. Historical performance results for investment indices and/or categories generally do not reflect the deduction of transaction and/or custodial charges, the deduction of an investment management fee, nor the impact of taxes, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing historical performance results.
Certain portions of SimonBaker & Partners LLC’s website (i.e. newsletters, articles, commentaries, etc.) may contain a discussion of, and/or provide access to, SimonBaker & Partners LLC’s (and those of other investment and non-investment professionals) positions and/or recommendations as of a specific prior date. This information may have been previously disseminated by SimonBaker & Partners LLC to its clients or associates. Due to various factors, including changing market conditions, such discussion may no longer be reflective of current position(s) and/or recommendation(s). Moreover, no client or prospective client should assume that any such discussion serves as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized advice from SimonBaker & Partners LLC, or from any other investment professional. You should not treat any opinion expressed as a specific inducement to make a particular investment or follow a particular strategy.
SimonBaker & Partners LLC is neither an attorney nor accountant, and no portion of the website content should be interpreted as legal, accounting or tax advice. Furthermore, the prospective client is solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy, or any other product or service, is appropriate or suitable for the prospective client based on the prospective client’s investment objectives and personal and financial situation. The prospective client should consult with an investment professional, or an attorney or tax professional regarding their specific investment, legal or tax situation.
