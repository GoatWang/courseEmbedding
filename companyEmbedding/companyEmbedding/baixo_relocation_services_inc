We will compete with other relocation service providers, including large
companies that offer global relocation services, such as Brookfield Global
Relocation Services, SIRVA Relocation, and Universal Relocations, as well as
smaller consultants, such as IGL Relocation and IOS Relocations Private Limited,
which primarily focus on the Indian market. There are also many small operators
or single agents that offer similar services in India. Competition with all of
these companies is based on price, services offered, and quality of service.
These companies generally have greater financial and technical resources,
industry expertise and managerial capabilities than we do.

Our success depends on our ability to differentiate ourselves by limiting our
market to a specific area of India and to offer very personalized service
whereby a customer has one consultant point of contact with us that is
responsible for ensuring that they receive all services that he or she has
purchased and acts as an exclusive liaison with third-party service providers.


Company Description
We were incorporated on January 7, 2014 in the State of Nevada. We are a 
development stage company and plan to commence operations as a consulting 
business whereby we will provide personalized relocation services to clients, 
both individual and corporate, who are relocating to the states of


 Maharashtra, 
Goa, or Karnataka, which are located in western India. We will assist clients 
who intend to relocate to the region for temporary, long-term, and permanent 
periods. We intend to offer a wide range of relocation services to our clients, 
including arranging and assisting with transportation to India, household goods 
movement, appropriate immigration documentation, real estate rental and 
purchases, children's' education registration, area orientation, housekeeping, 
utilities connections, banking introductions, local transportation, tax 
compliance, and language and cultural training. We will offer different pricing 
structures for each of the services we will provide.

Because we are a company that has either no or nominal operations or assets, or
assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents, we are considered to be a
"shell company". An investment in the shares of a shell company should be
considered highly illiquid given the resale restrictions that apply to them.

We intend to develop a relationship with third-party vendors in India in order
to assist and facilitate in providing our services. Clients will book various
services through us by telephone, email and through our website that we intend
to develop, and if a third-party vendor is involved, we will negotiate a fee for
referring that client. We do not currently have any agreements or contractual
relationships with any third-party service providers, customers or website
designers.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.  The following discussion of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, plan of operations and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended May 31, 2015 and 2014, together with the notes thereto included in this Form 10-Q. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors.  Overview  We were incorporated on January 7, 2014 in the State of Nevada. We plan to commence operations as a consulting business whereby we will provide personalized relocation services to clients, both individual and corporate, who are relocating to the state of Goa and later we plan to include the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, which are all located in western India. We will assist clients who intend to relocate to the region for temporary, long-term, and permanent periods. We intend to offer a wide range of relocation services to our clients, including arranging and assisting with transportation to India, household goods movement, appropriate immigration documentation, real estate rental and purchases, children's' education registration, area orientation, housekeeping, utilities connections, banking introductions, local transportation, tax compliance, and language and cultural training. We will offer different pricing structures for each of the services we will provide.  There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business since the date of incorporation. The Company has never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding, nor has it undergone any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.  Since inception, we have not generated consistent revenues and have incurred a cumulative net loss as reflected in the financial statements. We have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception.  The Company became a reporting company on September 4, 2014, 2014 after we had filed a prospectus that relates to the offering of a total of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock on a "self-underwritten" basis at a fixed price of $0.015 per share. In December 2014, we completed the sale of 3,000,000 common shares at the price of a $0.015 per share for total proceeds of $45,000.  Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated.  Plan of Operation  About Our Company  Since our incorporation, we have been engaged in organizational, planning and website development activities, and we have not generated any revenues.  Our goal is to offer a wide range of services to individual and business clients that intend to relocate to the states of Goa, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. Initially, we will focus our marketing efforts on English-speaking people that are unfamiliar with Indian culture, customs, and languages who seek consulting services to help them relocate and transition to life in India. All services that we provide will be charged on a per-service basis. We have also purchased a website domain, www.baixorelocation.com and have begun to plan the design and development of our website, which we will use to brand our company and inform potential clients of our services. We plan to commence operations as described in our registration statement and complete our corporate website. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations and pay for our website design.  Our president, Rosy Rodrigues, who has employment experience in operating an apartment rental agency and chauffeur referral service, will provide potential relocating clients with services related to obtaining housing and transportation services. She will also aid clients with education registration, area orientation, bank introductions, housekeeping arrangements, and utilities connections. We intend to outsource other services, such as immigration services to lawyers and tax compliance to accountants. We will charge our clients a flat rate fee for the services that they purchase from us. Our fees for arranging third-party services will be included in the invoices that we render to our clients. In addition, depending on our arrangements with various third-party vendors, we may charge them a separate referral fee for the business that they receive from us.  Our organizational and planning activities to date have consisted as follows:  a.  of registration of our domain name, initial funding by our shareholders,  b.  In December 2014, we completed the sale of 3,000,000 common shares at the price of a $0.015 per share for total proceeds of $45,000.  c.  We made application with FINRA for listing and have been listed for trading on March 4, 2015;  d.  We have incorporated an Indian subsidiary, Baixo Relocation Services Private Limited and have opened a back account.  e.  Our president, Rosy Rodrigues, has contacted various third-party service providers that would be prepared to perform relocation services for our clients on terms. Presently we have one party with two apartments interested in negotiating for our services  f.  We have retained a website developer who has commences design and narrative of the site for our corporate website that will describe the services that we offer to provide to our potential clients with the ability to contact us to request services or ask questions about the services that we offer, and to the extent possible, disclose the qualifications of some of the third-party service providers that agree to perform relocation services to our clients.  Our plan of operations over the 12 month period following successful completion of our offering is to establish and develop our service network, our website and our advertising and marketing plan. Our challenge will be to attract customers to our website and to advise them of the range of services that we will offer.  We anticipate achieving the following specific business milestones in the 12 months following the completion of our offering:  1.  For a period of six months from the date of completion of the offering, our president, Rosy Rodrigues, intends to formalize contractual relationships with various third-party service providers that are prepared to perform relocation services for our clients on terms acceptable to both parties. Presently we have one party with two apartments interested in negotiating for our services;  2.  During the second quarter, we intend to test our website and be operational;  3.  In addition to our website, we intend to retain a search engine optimization consultant that will aid us in developing an Internet presence and assure that our website is highly visible to potential clients that search for us;  4.  Once our website is operational, Ms. Rodrigues will undertake the design and implementation of social media accounts on websites such as Facebook, Google Plus, and Twitter. We anticipate that this process will take approximately one to two weeks and will have negligible cost to us;  5.  Subject to the initial success of our business, which may prevent Ms. Rodrigues from providing all of the consulting services that she intends to personally provide due to time constraints that would impact her ability to properly perform her tasks, we intend to hire employees to perform similar functions. The pay rates for such employees would be negotiable, but are anticipated to be approximately $3,000 per year. We anticipate that any wages would be paid from revenue that we earn and would not impact our use of proceeds. As our business develops, Ms. Rodrigues' role would transition from client consultant to a manager of all of our consultants. This would likely occur once we employed at least five consultants.  We do not expect to realize any revenues and do not expect to commence operations until approximately September 2015. Our independent auditor has issued a report on our audited financial statements which expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Currently, our President has increased the time and now devotes approximately 10% of her business time to the Company's operations. Ms. Rodrigues has indicated that she is willing to spend more time with the business as it grows and her services are needed. We anticipate that she will be required to spend about 20 hours a week on matters relating to our business when operations commence and we anticipate that then we will compensate her 18,000/- Indian rupees ($300) per month.  Since we became a reporting company, we are responsible for filing various forms with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") such as Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs. The shareholders may read and copy any material filed by us with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street N.W., Washington, DC, 20549. The shareholders may obtain information on the operations of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.  We have no plans to change our planned business activities or to combine with another business, and we are not aware of any events or circumstances that might cause these plans to change.  Results of Operations  We did not earn any revenues for the three months ended May 31, 2015 and from inception on January 7, 2014 to May 31, 2015. We do not expect to realize any revenues until we are able to execute our business plan.  For the three months ended May 31, 2015, we have incurred total operating expenses in the amount of $7,498, mainly comprised of professional fees totaling $5,360 which relates to fees for incorporating our Indian subsidiary and audit fees.  For the three months ended May 31, 2014, we have incurred total operating expenses in the amount of $4,773, mainly comprised of professional fees totaling $4,700 which relates to legal and accounting fees for the registration statement and related costs.  We incurred total operating expenses in the amount of $34,521 from inception on January 7, 2014 through May 31, 2015. These operating expenses are comprised of professional fees totaling $16,485.  We have not incurred any expenses for research and development since inception. As a result of operating losses, there has been no provision for the payment of income taxes from the date of inception.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As at May 31, 2015, we had a cash balance of $43,457. If additional funds become required before generation of revenue, the additional funding may come from debt financing or equity financing from the sale of our common stock.  Our future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:  �  our ability to raise additional funding;  �  cost of development of our website;  �  interest by online users to purchase our products which will generate revenue from online sales.  Due to our lack of operating history and present inability to generate revenues, our auditors have stated their opinion that there currently exists a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Going Concern Consideration  The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the period ended February 28, 2015 included a going concerned paragraph because of a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based on the absence of an established source of revenue, recurring losses from operations, and our need for additional financing in order to fund our operations in fiscal 2016.  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.  Forward Looking Statements  The information in this quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and  Jul 09, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  We are a company without revenues or operations. We have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. Our limited start-up operations have consisted of the formation of our business plan and identification of our target market.  Because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we implement our business plan, our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital.  We believe that we will have to raise further to begin operations and we cannot assure you that we will stay in business after our operations have commenced. If we are unable to successfully negotiate strategic alliances with purveyors of services to enable us to offer these services to our clients, or if we are unable to attract enough clients to utilize our services, we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources, like a second public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans from our officer or others in order for us to maintain our operations. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering.  Our administrative offices are currently located at the premises of our President, Rosy Rodrigues, who provides such space to us on a rent-free basis. We plan to use these offices until we require larger space.  Results of Operations:   For the Period From January 7, 2014 Year Ended (inception) to February 28, 2015 February 28, 2014 Total Operating Expenses $ 26,398 $ 625 Net income (loss) (26,398) (625)  Revenue  We have not earned any revenues since our inception.  Page 11  Expenses Our operating expenses for the year ended February 28, 2015 and 2013 are outlined in the table below: For the Period From January 7, 2014 Year Ended (inception) to February 28, 2015 February 28, 2014 Professional fees $ 10,500 $ 625 General and Administration fees 15,898 - Total 26,398 625  Results of Operations  We did not earn any revenues for the year ended February 28, 2015 and from inception on January 7, 2014 to February 28, 2015. We do not expect to realize any revenues until we are able to secure additional funds and execute our business plan. Since inception, we sold 8,000,000 shares of common stock total proceeds of $70,000.  For the year ended February 28, 2015, we have incurred total operating expenses in the amount of $26,398 which comprises of professional audit fees and legal fees totaling $10,500 and general and administrative expenses totaling $15,898 which mainly relates to transfer agent fees and travel for completion of the offering of $45,000. For the period ended February 28, 2014, we have incurred total operating expenses in the amount of $625.  We incurred total operating expenses in the amount of $27,023 from inception on January 7, 2014 through February 28, 2015. These operating expenses comprised of professional fees totaling $11,125 and general administrative expenses totaling $15,898.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our cash balance at February 28, 2015 was $44,643 and $1,666 in current liabilities. In December 2014, we have raised $45,000 from sale of 3,000,000 shares. If additional funds become required before generation of revenue, the additional funding may come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock.  Our future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:  �  our ability to raise additional funding;  �  cost of development of our website;  �  interest by online users to purchase our products which will generate revenue from online sales.  Due to our lack of operating history and present inability to generate revenues, our auditors have stated their opinion that there currently exists a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The detailed analysis of the risk factors is disclosed our Company's registration statement Form S-1 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Future Financings  At our present, we do not anticipate that we will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations.  If we require additional financing, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. We are pursuing various alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements.  Page 12  We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.  Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we generate sufficient revenues. There is no assurance we will ever reach that point. In the meantime the continuation of the Company is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, our ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations.  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Contractual Obligations  As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.  Going Concern Consideration  The report of our independent registered public accounting firm raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based on the absence of an established source of revenue, recurring losses from operations, and our need for additional financing in order to fund our operations in 2015.  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. "Risk Factors" section of our 2014 Form S-1/A, includes a detailed discussion of these factors which have not changed materially from those included in this Form 10-K.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  Forward Looking Statements  The information in this quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and  Recently Accounting Pronouncements  We have reviewed all recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its EITF), the AICPA, and the SEC and believes that none of them will a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.

	Note 1: Nature and Continuance of Operations



	 


	Baixo Relocation Services, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on January 7, 2014 ("Inception"). The Company operates as a relocation service provider for clients moving to the State of Goa, India. The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Baixo, India and its fiscal year-end is February 28.


	 



	Note 2: Basis of Presentation



	 



	Unaudited interim consolidated financial statements



	 


	The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Baixo Relocation Services, Inc and its wholly-owned Indian subsidiary, Baixo Relocation Services Private Limited. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. During the period ended August 31, 2016, the Company dissolved its wholly-owned subsidiary and therefore the balance sheet as at August 31, 2016 represents only the assets and liabilities of the Company.


	 


	The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q of Regulation S-X. They may not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed herein, there has been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 29, 2016 included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the three and six months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending February 28, 2017.


	 



	Note 3: Capital Stock



	 


	The total number of common shares authorized that may be issued by the Company is 75,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. At August 31, 2016, there were 8,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding (at February 29, 2016: 8,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding).


	 


	At August 31, 2016, there were no issued and outstanding stock options or warrants.

	Note 4: Going Concern



	 


	These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $70,063 as at August 31, 2016 ($54,663 as at February 29, 2016) and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. In addition to operational expenses, as the Company executes its business plan, it is incurring expenses related to complying with its public reporting requirements. In order to remain in business, the Company will need to raise capital in the next twelve months. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. In order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its current level of operations.






	Note 5: Subsequent Events


	 


	The Company’s management has evaluated subsequent event up to October 20, 2016, the date the financial statements were issued, pursuant to the requirements of ASC 855 and has determined the following material subsequent event:


	 


	Effective October 3, 2016, Rosy Rodrigues, the majority shareholder, sole executive officer and member of the Board of Directors of the Company entered into certain stock purchase agreements with certain investors. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreements, Rodrigues sold and transferred at a per share price of $0.037 the control block of the Company consisting of 5,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and representing approximately 62.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. This has resulted in a change of control.


	 



	Note 6: Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	The Company evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued and determined that the adoption of these pronouncements would not have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.




	 


	The following discussion of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, plan of operations and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, together with the notes thereto included in this Form 10-Q. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors.


	 



	OVERVIEW



	 


	Baixo Relocation Services, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on January 7, 2014 in the State of Nevada. We previously operated a consulting business whereby we provided personalized relocation services to clients, both individual and corporate, who were relocating to the state of Goa. We assisted clients who intended to relocate to the region for temporary, long-term, and permanent periods. We offered a wide range of relocation services to our clients, including arranging and assisting with transportation in the state of Goa, India, household goods movement, appropriate immigration documentation, real estate rental and purchases, children’s’ education registration, area orientation, housekeeping, utilities connections, banking introductions, local transportation, tax compliance, and language and cultural training.


	 


	As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are deemed to be a shell corporation as defined in Rule 230.405 of the Securities Act and, therefore, issued shares of restricted stock available for sale under Rule 144 may be affected. We must cure ourselves of our shell status by: (i) no longer fitting the definition of a shell company as defined in Rule 144(i)(1); (ii) subjecting to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act") and filing all reports (other than Form 8-K reports) required under the Exchange Act for the preceding twelve months; and (iii) filing current “Form 10 information” with the Securities and Exchange Commission reflecting our status as an entity that is no longer an issuer described in Rule 144(i)(1) and one year has elapsed since the filing of the "Form 10 information" with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 



	Change in Control



	 


	Effective October 3, 2016, Rosy Rodrigues (“Rodrigues”), the majority shareholder, sole executive officer and member of the Board of Directors of Baixo Relocation Services, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”) entered into certain stock purchase agreements (collectively, the “Stock Purchase Agreements”) with certain individuals and/or entities (collectively, the “Investors”). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreements, Rodrigues sold and transferred at a per share price of $0.037 the control block of the Company consisting of 5,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and representing approximately 62.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock.


	 



	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 


	The following discussions are based on our consolidated financial statements, including our subsidiaries. These charts and discussions summarize our financial statements for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto, included with our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year ended February 29, 2016.


	 




	Balance sheet – as at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016




	 


	At August 31, 2016, our current assets were $32 and our current liabilities were $300. Current assets comprised $32 in cash and current liabilities comprised of $300 in accrued liabilities.


	 


	As of August 31, 2016, our total assets were $32 comprised of $32 in current assets. The decrease in total assets during the six month period ended August 31, 2016 from fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in cash of $15,132.

	For the six months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.




	 


	Our net loss for the six month period ended August 31, 2016 was ($15,400) compared to a net loss of ($22,091) during the six month period ended August 31, 2015 (a decrease in net loss of $6,691). We did not generate any revenue during the six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.


	 


	During the six month period ended August 31, 2016, we incurred operating expenses of $15,400 compared to $22,091 incurred during the six month period ended August 31, 2015 (a decrease of $6,691). These operating expenses incurred during the six month period ended August 31, 2016 consisted of: (i) general and administrative of $5,688 (2015: $3,313); and (ii) professional fees of $9,712 (2015: $18,778). Operating expenses incurred during the six month period ended August 31, 2016 decreased compared to the six month period ended August 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of $9,066, partially offset by an increase in General expenses amounting to $2,375.


	 


	Our loss from operations during the six month period ended August 31, 2016 was ($15,400) compared to a loss from operations of ($22,091) during the six month period ended August 31, 2015.


	 


	During the six month period ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively, we did not incur any other expense.


	 


	Therefore, we realized a net loss of ($15,400) or ($0.002) per share for the six month period ended August 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of ($22,091) or ($0.003) per share for the six month period ended August 31, 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 8,000,000 for the six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.


	 




	For the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.




	 


	Our net loss for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 was ($7,416) compared to a net loss of ($14,593) during the three month period ended August 31, 2015 (a decrease in net loss of $7,902). We did not generate any revenue during the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.

These operating expenses incurred during the three month period ended August 31, 2016 consisted of: (i) general and administrative of $1,204 (2015: $1,175); and (ii) professional fees of $6,212 (2015: $13,418). Operating expenses incurred during the three month period ended August 31, 2016 decreased compared to the three month period ended August 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of $7,206.


	 


	Our loss from operations during the three month period ended August 31, 2016 was ($7,416) compared to a loss from operations of ($14,593) during the three month period ended August 31, 2015.


	 


	During the three month period ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively, we did not incur any other expense.


	 


	Therefore, we realized a net loss of ($7,416) or ($0.001) per share for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of ($14,593) or ($0.002) per share for the three month period ended August 31, 2015. The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 8,000,000 for the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.


	 



	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCE



	 


	At August 31, 2016, our current assets were $32 and our current liabilities were $300, which resulted in a working capital deficit of $268. As at August 31, 2016, current assets comprised $32 in cash and current liabilities comprised of $300 in accrued liabilities.


	 


	We are actively seeking various financing operations to meet the working capital requirements.


	 




	Cash Flows from Operating Activities




	 


	We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the six month period ended August 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was ($15,441) compared to net cash flows used in operating activities of ($23,416) for the six month period ended August 31, 2015. Net cash flows used in operating activities consisted primarily of a net loss of $15,400 (2015: $22,091), which was partially adjusted by ($41) (2015: ($1,325)) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.


	 




	Cash Flows from Investing Activities




	 


	For the six month period ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, net cash flows used in investing activities was $-0- .


	 




	Cash Flows from Financing Activities




	 


	For the six month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, net cash flows provided from financing activities was $-0-.


	 


	Our cash balance at August 31, 2016 was $32. If additional funds become required before generation of revenue, the additional funding may come from debt financing or equity financing from the sale of our common stock.


	 


	Our future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:


	 









	·



	our ability to raise additional funding;







	 




	 








	·



	interest by online users to retain us for our services which will generate revenue.

	Table of Contents





	 


	Due to our lack of operating history and present inability to generate revenues, our auditors have stated their opinion that there currently exists a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The detailed analysis of the risk factors is disclosed our Company’s registration statement Form S-1 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 




	Future Financings




	 


	As at August 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $268 and we will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations.


	 


	When we will require additional financing, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. We are pursuing various alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements.


	 


	We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.


	 


	Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we generate sufficient revenues. There is no assurance we will ever reach that point. In the meantime the continuation of the Company is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, our ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and the attainment of profitable operations.


	 


	Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	 


	We require approximately $15,000 for the next 12 months as a reporting issuer and additional funds are required. Before generation of revenue, the additional funding may come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock or loans from management or related third parties. In the event we do not raise sufficient capital to implement its planned operations or divest, your entire investment could be lost.


	 



	Going Concern Consideration



	 


	The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the period ended February 29, 2016 included a going concerned paragraph because of a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based on the absence of an established source of revenue, recurring losses from operations, and our need for additional financing in order to fund our operations in fiscal 2017.


	 


	Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of September 30, 2015. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the second quarter of 2016. In connection with such evaluation, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred since the beginning of our second quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. While there have been no changes, we have assessed our internal controls as being deficient and will be taking steps during 2016/2017 to remedy such deficiencies.

	CHANGE IN CONTROL



	 


	Effective October 3, 2016, Rosy Rodrigues (“Rodrigues”), the majority shareholder, our sole executive officer and member of the Board of Directors, entered into those certain stock purchase agreements (collectively, the “Stock Purchase Agreements”) with certain individuals and/or entities (collectively, the “Investors”). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreements, Rodrigues sold and transferred at a per share price of $0.037 the control block of the Company consisting of 5,000,000 shares of restricted common stock and representing approximately 62.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore, there has been a change in control.

Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights.

	CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT



	 


	Effective October 3, 2016, our certifying accountant, Seale and Beers, CPAs, LLC (“S&B”), was dismissed as our independent registered public accounting firm based upon the recent announcement of its acquisition by a new auditing firm, AMC Auditing, LLC. We have engaged SRCO Professional Corporation, Chartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants (“SRCO”) as our principal independent registered public accounting firm effective October 3, 2016. The decision to change our principal independent registered public accounting firm has been approved by our Board of Directors.


	 


	The reports of S&B on our financial statements for fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 (which included the balance sheet as of February 29, 2016, and the statement of operations, cash flows and stockholders’ equity as of February 29, 2016), for either of the past two fiscal years, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, other than to state that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. During our fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 and during the subsequent period through to the date of S&B's dismissal, there were no disagreements between us and S&B, whether or not resolved, on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of S&B, would have caused S&B to make reference thereto in its report on our audited financial statements.


	 


	We provided S&B with a copy of the Current Report on Form 8-K and requested that S&B furnish us with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not S&B agrees with the statements made in the Current Report on Form 8-K with respect to S&B and, if not, stating the aspects with which they do not agree. We received the requested letter from S&B wherein it has confirmed their agreement to our disclosures in the Current Report with respect to S&B. A copy of S&B's letter was filed as an exhibit to the Current Report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 6, 2016.


	 


	In connection with our appointment of SRCO as our principal registered accounting firm at this time, we have not consulted SRCO on any matter relating to the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or contemplated, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements during the two most recent fiscal years (February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015) and subsequent interim period through the date of engagement.


	 


	The contact information for SRCO is Park Place Corporate Centre, 15 Wertheim Court, Suite 409, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada L4B 3H7, telephone 905.882.9500.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
