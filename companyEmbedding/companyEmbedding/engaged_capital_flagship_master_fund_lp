Engaged Capital Nominates Five Highly Qualified Candidates for Election to the Board of Rent-A-Center | Business Wire


























































Engaged Capital Nominates Five Highly Qualified Candidates for 
      Election to the Board of Rent-A-Center





        Engaged Capital has lost confidence in RCII Board’s willingness to 
        fulfill its fiduciary duty and independently identify the optimal 
        risk-adjusted strategy to restore value to RCII shareholders.
      

        Reiterates call for RCII Board to hire a financial advisor and 
        immediately initiate a strategic alternatives process to evaluate a 
        sale of the entire Company.
      

        Engaged Capital is concerned that the current board and management may 
        take actions that would materially harm shareholders.
      

        Formally nominates Mitchell E. Fadel (former President and COO of 
        RCII), William K. (Ken) Butler (former COO of AAN), Jeffrey J. Brown, 
        Carol A. McFate and Christopher B. Hetrick at the upcoming 2017 annual 
        meeting.
      






February 23, 2017 08:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Engaged 
      Capital, LLC, an investment firm specializing in enhancing the value 
      of small and mid-cap North American equities, today sent a letter to the 
      Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Rent-A-Center, 
      Inc. (“RCII”) (NASDAQ:RCII) formally nominating five highly 
      qualified candidates for election to the Board at the Company’s upcoming 
      2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
    


      Glenn W. Welling, Managing Member of Engaged Capital, LLC commented, “It 
      is time for change at RCII. The current Board has presided over years of 
      declining operating performance, deteriorating financial results, and a 
      decimation of shareholder value. Despite years of underperformance, 
      these same directors refuse to act with a sense of urgency to explore 
      all alternatives to create value for the owners of the Company. As one 
      of the Company’s largest shareholders, we felt we had no choice but to 
      present shareholders with an alternative slate of directors – directors 
      who can help stabilize the business while also evaluating all strategic 
      options available to the Company. We are pleased that we were able to 
      attract two of the most experienced operators in the industry to our 
      slate: Mitch Fadel, the former President and COO of RCII and Ken Butler, 
      the former COO of AAN, both of whom are highly qualified to replace Mark 
      Speese, RCII’s Chairman, interim CEO and co-founder, who is up for 
      election at this year's meeting. Both have the capabilities and hands-on 
      experience that is sorely missing in RCII’s boardroom today. In 
      addition, Carol McFate, Jeff Brown, and Chris Hetrick bring decades of 
      financial and transaction experience to the Board that is paramount to 
      assessing and taking action on the highest value option for the 
      Company’s future. We believe it is time shareholders have directors who 
      exhibit an understanding that their job is to act as the fiduciaries of 
      all the Company’s shareholders and not just those shares represented in 
      the boardroom.”
    

      The full text of the letter follows:
    

      February 23, 2017
    

      Board of DirectorsRent-A-Center, Inc.5501 Headquarters DrivePlano, 
      Texas 75024
    

      Members of the Board:
    

      Engaged Capital, LLC (together with its affiliates, “Engaged Capital”) 
      has a 12.9% economic interest in Rent-A-Center, Inc. (“RCII” or the 
      “Company”), making us one of the Company’s largest shareholders. As we 
      have expressed numerous times, we believe the RCII Board of Directors 
      (the “Board”) should immediately hire a financial advisor and initiate a 
      strategic alternatives process to evaluate a sale of the entire Company 
      before attempting to pursue a risky public turnaround strategy. The 
      Company’s over 75% decline in share price from its value above $35 a 
      little over two years ago is a stark reminder of the need to benchmark 
      the risk-adjusted alternatives available to the Company. As we 
      highlighted in our December 7, 2016 letter, we believe the Company could 
      command a significant equity premium given the capital structure of the 
      business. For example, based on yesterday’s closing price of $8.40, an 
      acquisition price of $16 per share would represent a 90% 
      premium for shareholders yet only a 38% premium to the 
      Company’s enterprise value. Based on our industry research, we are 
      confident there are numerous parties, both strategic and financial, that 
      would have serious interest in acquiring the Company. Given the history 
      of shareholder value destruction, poor operational execution, weak 
      corporate governance and reactive management change, stubbornly 
      committing to a standalone strategy when other options remain unexplored 
      is simply unacceptable.
    

      While we appreciate the open dialogue we have had to date with the 
      Board, we are extremely disappointed by the Company’s apparent refusal 
      to address our concerns. We believe the recent 100,000 share open market 
      purchase by Mark Speese, RCII’s Chairman, interim CEO and co-founder, 
      signals that the Board is unlikely to proactively commence a strategic 
      alternatives process in the near future. As a consequence of this 
      inaction, we have lost confidence in the willingness of the Board to 
      fulfill its fiduciary duty and independently identify the optimal 
      risk-adjusted strategy to restore value to RCII shareholders.
    

      Our interactions with the Board thus far suggest its behavior as a whole 
      may reflect a personal loyalty to Mr. Speese, who owns only 2.3% of the 
      Company, at the expense of RCII shareholders. This is particularly 
      concerning because we believe Mr. Speese has a significant conflict of 
      interest that could prevent RCII from maximizing value for its 
      shareholders. By pursuing a risky turnaround strategy that allows him to 
      retain control of the Company he co-founded and to maintain his 
      leadership position, Mr. Speese clearly benefits in ways that 
      shareholders, whose primary interest is the Company’s value, do not 
      benefit. Thus, it is imperative for the Board to not let the personal 
      interests of one director stand in the way of value creation. As we see 
      no evidence that the incumbent Board is willing to prioritize the 
      interest of shareholders, we believe the Board must be reconstituted 
      with new directors who will maintain an unquestionable allegiance to the 
      true owners of the Company – the shareholders.
    

      Furthermore, we are extremely concerned that Mr. Speese, under the cover 
      provided by a group of long-tenured and apparently conflicted incumbent 
      directors, may materially harm shareholders if he acts to ensure his 
      continued control of the Company at any cost. These actions include, but 
      are not limited to:
    

      1) Failing to respond to incoming communications from parties expressing 
      an interest in acquiring the Company. It is our understanding that Mr. 
      Speese may be employing this strategy so that he can either legitimately 
      tell the Board he has not received meaningful approaches from interested 
      parties or to limit his interactions to parties that are in his personal 
      best interest.
    

      2) Failing to inform all members of the Board of such inbound 
      communications.
    

      3) Restructuring the Company’s debt in a way that transfers value from 
      equity holders to debt holders, effectively acting as an implicit poison 
      pill (e.g. onerous prepayment penalties) for would-be acquirers. Mr. 
      Speese is having discussions with lenders on refinancing alternatives 
      which we are concerned could make RCII less valuable to an acquirer or 
      make an acquisition of the Company more difficult.
    

      4) Selling a piece of the Company while refusing to evaluate a sale of 
      the entire Company, ultimately damaging the value of the remaining 
      business.
    

      5) Diluting current shareholders by placing equity or convertible debt 
      with a “friendly” party to protect the status quo.
    

      6) Negotiating a sale of the entire Company to a “friendly” party as 
      opposed to running a full and fair process.
    

      7) Delaying a formal consideration of strategic alternatives to provide 
      interim management more time to operate the business, which, despite 
      their best efforts, and based upon recent performance, could result in a 
      continued worsening of operational performance and a further decline in 
      equity value.
    

      We are hereby putting each and every director on notice. We will use any 
      and all resources at our disposal to ensure that the 
      approximately 98% of shares outstanding not owned by Mr. Speese are 
      protected from further value destruction. More specifically, we call on 
      RCII’s six independent directors (Michael J. Gade, Rishi Garg, Jeffrey 
      Jackson, J.V. Lentell, Leonard H. Roberts and Stephen L. Pepper) to act 
      objectively in these deliberations and to hold Mr. Speese accountable. 
      You are being closely watched by us and the rest of RCII’s shareholder 
      base. To be clear, we intend to hold each of you personally liable to 
      the fullest extent permitted by law should you continue down a value 
      destructive path and fail to act in the best interests of the Company’s 
      shareholders. We believe that if you choose to do what is right for the 
      Company’s shareholders, as is your duty, the potential exists to create 
      a significant amount of shareholder value by capturing a large 
      percentage of the “fixed” value of RCII in a sale of the Company.
    

      Given our interactions with the Company thus far, and the concerns 
      highlighted above in this letter, we feel we have been left with no 
      choice but to seek significant Board change. Given that five of seven 
      incumbent directors have served on the Board for over ten years and two 
      of such directors (including Mr. Speese) have served on the Board for 
      over twenty years, we believe this Board is stale and needs to be 
      refreshed with new directors. We are formally providing the Board notice 
      of our nomination of five highly qualified candidates for election to 
      the Board at the Company’s upcoming 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; 
      provided, however, that we intend to withdraw two of our nominees to the 
      extent that only three seats remain up for election at the meeting. We 
      believe these individuals possess the financial, operational and 
      strategic acumen the Board urgently needs. Our nominees are:

      serving as President – U.S. Pawn for EZCORP, Inc. (NASDAQ:EZPW), a
