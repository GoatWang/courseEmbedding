I build great teams, processes, platforms and practices that help enable big ideas and find creative ways to execute them.  I believe that a customer focused approach when combined with analytics is the source of truth for modern marketing teams. In my roles at F5 Networks I’m focused on building out a world class digital marketing platform, a leading technical community, as well as modern Corporate and Digital Marketing capabilities and innovations. I’ve led operational production and creative efforts that focused on execution and delivery in support of strategic goals.  Prior to joining F5 I co-founded and managed a Digital Marketing platform and managed services SaaS business and large ERP software implementations and customization teams for Epicor Software. I attended the University of Massachusetts Lowell before completing my commercial pilots license in Boston, MA. and worked as a bush pilot in Maine for a few years before discovering web technologies and programming. I’m a curious guy, an intrinsically motivated learner which means I’m mostly self-taught through experience and hard knocks in technology, software development, web, digital marketing, creative marketing, corporate marketing and leadership.  I live in Seattle, WA with my wife Suzanne, our three children and three dogs.ExperienceSr Director, Digital Marketing and Customer ExperienceF5 NetworksMarch 2017  –  Present (5 months)Greater Seattle AreaSr. Director of Corporate MarketingF5 NetworksOctober 2016  –  Present (10 months)Greater Seattle AreaDirector Digital MarketingF5 NetworksSeptember 2014  –  October 2016 (2 years 2 months)Greater Seattle AreaSr. Mgr, Digital Marketing PlatformF5 NetworksOctober 2013  –  September 2014 (1 year)Greater Seattle AreaManager, Community PlatformF5 NetworksApril 2012  –  October 2013 (1 year 7 months)Community Platform DeveloperF5 NetworksJuly 2011  –  April 2012 (10 months)Co-Founder / VP Product Marketing and ManagementFirstegg LLCFebruary 2000  –  2011 (11 years)Louisville, Kentucky AreaPractice Manager, Custom Software Development GroupEpicor SoftwareApril 1998  –  September 2001 (3 years 6 months)Louisville, Kentucky AreaDirector Of Information TechnologyThe Foreside CompanyAugust 1994  –  March 1998 (3 years 8 months)Volunteer Experience & CausesTeam ManagerTeam Louisville (Cycling)PresentHealthDevelopment of racing team, coaching programs, individual athletic health accomplishments and race promotion/fundraising.SkillsCloud ComputingEmail MarketingStart-upsSaaSSoftware DevelopmentWeb DevelopmentSocial MediaSEOAgile MethodologiesEnterprise SoftwareProduct ManagementWeb AnalyticsProgram ManagementSocial NetworkingSoftware Project ManagementSee 29+NetworkingManagementInformation ArchitectureProduct MarketingAccount ManagementE-commerceSalesMarketingProduct DevelopmentB2BDigital MarketingBusiness DevelopmentTeam LeadershipStrategic PartnershipsCRMMarketing StrategyStrategic PlanningCross-functional Team LeadershipLeadershipIntegrationGo-to-market StrategyStrategySoftware as a Service (SaaS)Search Engine Optimization (SEO)Integrated Multi-Channel MarketingCorporate BrandingBrand ManagementCampaign PlansCampaign DevelopmentSee lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!LanguagesEnglishHonors & Awards5 Star Award WinnerF5 NetworksApril 20165 Star is the highest honor one can achieve at F5 Networks.

RecommendationsA preview of what LinkedIn members have to say about Steven:Steven is the kind of leader you want tackling big challenges – his vision and drive deliver results.

Over the last six years. I have seen his vision, execution and direction change the way F5 sees marketing and what is possible. He is a great advocate for the customer and the community – always ensuring the line between community and marketing is deeply understood.

Steven has been so successful because he is exceptionally skilled at building and developing teams, tackling the big problems, partnering with other organizations to build shared vision and finds ways to minimize the things that don’t drive notable change or deliver value for the customer. 

Being part of Steven’s team I have has the opportunity to learn many great lessons from him about integrity, communication, collaboration and always staying curious about how the market and industry is evolving. 

Few people have the opportunity to work for a truly great manager – I feel very fortunate to be one of them. 
See moreSee lessSteve is literally the best digital marketing and solution marketers I have ever worked with. As CMO at F5 Networks Steve worked for me and was instrumental in the complete transformation of F5 Marketing - moving us from traditional event/copy based marketing to solution marketing with business outcomes delivered thru the lens of digital and social media. 

Steve is a strong strategist, great leader and all around stellar marketing exec. His teams love him. His peers love him. And he always finds a way to create win/wins for those he is collaborating with. Super strong IQ and EQ which is rare. 

He always finds a way to get it done - on time and under budget. Can't recommend Steve strong enough - F5 Networks would not be where it is at today without Steve's strong contribution and leadership.

The books in this department are geared directly toward young readers who may not yet have the ability to read on their own or may still be learning the basics of how to sound out unfamiliar words, but we also have books for older kids ages 11 15 who are reading chapter books and other advanced children's literature. Our children's book offerings cover a wide range of reading abilities and subject matter, allowing you to build the perfect library for kids at every stage in their learning journey. Every Day Low Prices mean you can create an engaging and diverse collection of reading materials to enrich your kids' lives and make learning a fun experience for the whole family.Early childhood booksOur Children's Books department includes categories for books for children from ages Birth 2 Years and 3 4 Years. These are the shortest, simplest books, designed for parents to read out loud to their little ones. Some parents may use these easy-to-read books as a basis for teaching their children how to read by sounding out words and recognizing specific letters. If this kind of education is a priority for you, both of these sections include specially written books that focus on simple words, the alphabet and numbers from 1 10. If you'd rather just read to your child at this early stage, you can find plenty of simple stories and picture books in these sections that will suit that need as well.Books for school-aged childrenChildren who are more advanced can find longer and more complex books in our sections for children ages 5 7 and 8 11 years old. The 5 7 Years section includes a wide variety of short, simple books with easy plot lines and basic vocabulary that many elementary school children will be able to read on their own. Books in the 8 11 Years category become more advanced, dividing into chapter books that still have bigger print and smaller words to avoid frustrating young readers. Each of these sections includes classic titles and popular new books that you can choose from according to your child's personality and interests. We also have a special section for ages 15 & Up so high school-age kids can find the classics that are part of their school syllabi and discover new titles to read in their free time.Shopping for children's booksIf you're shopping for books just to add some new titles to your child's library, you can have them join you in the shopping process to make it more fun and make reading more exciting. Point out different book subjects and titles to your child and let him or her tell you which ones seem the most interesting. Focusing on the books in our Popular Brands & Characters section may be a particularly good idea when you're shopping for books with your kid; the familiar characters and themes will capture their attention and help them feel more excited about reading. If you're shopping for books as a gift for a baby shower, birthday or holiday, you can focus on classics that have shown up on kids' bedroom bookshelves for generations. From early-reader classics like the Richard Scarry Golden Books or the Berenstain Bears series to timeless chapter books like Hatchet and books by Judy Blume, picking out some of your own favorite children's books can be a fun way to bond with your children and carry on literary traditions in your family. Shopping for books for holidays is also made easy by focusing on our seasonal shops and sections in the Children's Books department. Mother's Day, Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Thanksgiving and other holidays are all popular subjects for children's books that will get your kids excited about the season.Boxed sets and collectionsOne great way to shop our Children's Books department is to look for boxed sets and book collections in our Character Books and Classic Books sections. You can find collected books from beloved authors or those featuring famous characters in these sections. Buying a complete collection at once gives your child the ability to work their way through all the books in the collection without needing to wait and buy each new book in a series. These collected sets also make fantastic gifts for baby showers, birthdays and other occasions. New parents will appreciate having their baby's bookshelves stocked with all the classics from a beloved series. We offer collections of Children's Books for different ages and stages of educational development, making this a versatile option throughout a child's life.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863242, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35.
