Plot[edit]
A remote village named Pali in Andhra Pradesh is hounded by an unknown disease, and several villagers loose their life each month. The village Tantric (Rao Ramesh) predicts that a powerful man will come to their rescue as God. He assigns his assistant Sidhappa (Shafi) the duty to find a man with such unknown supernatural power, and bring him to their village.
Meanwhile, Alluri Seetarama Raju alias Raju (Mahesh Babu) is an eccentric Orange Cab driver lives in Hyderabad, with his grandfather (Kota Srinivasa Rao), who is a teacher. Raju is currently in Rajasthan in search of the family of a man named Bilavar Singh. In his journey, He meets a Gemini TV television reporter Baabji (Sunil) who comes to Rajasthan to shoot a travel documentary.
Raju introduces himself to Baabji and tells him the reason for him being in Rajasthan. He describes a woman named Subhashini (Anushka Shetty), whom he considers brings bad luck to him. Previously he encountered her in various occasions in which she damages his taxi due to her reckless driving. Raju lands in hospital one day when Subhashini mixes epsom salt laxative intended for someone else, in Raju's coffee thinking that it meets her at a coffee shop to collect the compensation for his taxi's damages from her. For this reason, he considers her a bad luck.
One day, he drives two men, Geology Scientist Dr. Paranji and his assistant Bilavar Singh, to their destination the Geological Survey of India. But he sees them getting gunned down by some hench men and Bilavar falls out of a window and lands straight on Raju's taxi, completely destroying it. Since Bilavar has insurance, Raju's boss tells him to deliver the insurance check of Rs. 5,00,000 to Bilavar Singh's family in Girdwala, Rajasthan and get Rs. 1,00,000 in return to pay for his car damages.
Meanwhile, Subhashini's father, business magnate Durga Prasad (Tanikella Bharani), brings her a match, another business magnate GK's (Prakash Raj) son. The main reason for the proposal is to establish a strong business partnership. GK's son takes her to Rajasthan for a date. But Subhashini runs away after she sees a condom packet drop from his pocket and realizes his true intentions. GK finds out about it and informs Durga Prasad and promises to bring Subhashini back. He sends his henchman, Govardhan (Subbaraju) to Rajasthan in search of Subhashini. To Raju's dismay, Subhashini finds Raju and Baabji and learns that she is in Rajasthan. Subhashini, Baabji, Raju, and a botanist Tom (Ali) find Girdwala and hand over the check to Bilavar Singh's family, but Raju refuses to ask for the Rs. 1,00,000 when he sees the family's poverty. Tom remains in the village as the villagers want to punish him for cutting a sentimental plant, Baabji goes away with his shooting team, but does not offer them a ride as he is scared of Subhashini's reckless behavior.
As Raju and Subhashini return, Govardhan's men attack, stab Raju, and take Subhashini after knocking her unconscious. But Raju survives, fights and kills almost all of Govardhan's men, while Govardhan escapes from the scenario leaving Subhashini behind. Just as Raju goes unconscious, Sidhappa finds him and believes he is the God after seeing the omens. Sidhappa and Subhashini take Raju to Pali, where the villagers treat his wounds. After waking up, he finds all of the villagers praising him as Man God. He finds out from Subhashini that they are in Pali, and that the villagers see him as the supernatural man God that the village Tantric was describing about, and who will rescue the village. Initially reluctant to help them out, he escapes to Hyderabad where he hands over Subhashini to her father. After realizing that Tom and Siddappa followed him to Hyderabad, Raju puts fate to test and when he understands the concept of deityhood and god, he makes it a goal to solve the mystical series of deaths in the village. After tracking down a doctor (who works for GK), the dean of the medical college run by GK (who set up the medical camp in Pali), Govardhan and Miriyam (Brahmanandam), GK's lawyer, Raju discovers that the plastic factory in Pali deposits it's wastes in the driking water source nearby, thus contaminating and killing the villagers. While Tom and Siddappa think this is the end of the story, Raju suspects that there is more to the story, that so many villagers are dying due to the plastic factory waste that is being contaminated with drinking water, and GK actually wants the villagers in Pali to die, which was why GK had the Government's medical camp removed periodically. He finds GK's assistant (Archana) and suspects that she has something to do with GK's plan as she did not get into his taxi along with Geologist Paranji, indicating that she knew beforehand that he was going to be killed. Raju inquires her about GK's intentions, who reveals that Paranji discovered earlier that there is a large Iridium deposit under Pali, which is worth billions, and informed GK about it.
Despite GK's warning to Paranji of not revealing it to anybody else, he tries to inform the Geological Survey of India about the deposits, which was why he and Bilavar Singh, who was with him, were killed that day. GK suspects that Raju might also know about the Iridium deposit because he was with Paranji when he was killed which was why GK sent Govardhan to kill him, not to retrieve Subhashini. Raju was lured to Girdwala under the cover of delivering the insurance check to Bilavar Singh's family (GK had the insurance documents planted) and was attacked by Govardhan. GK needs the strong plastic glass from the plastic factory to pack the Iridium. He wanted the Pali villagers to vacate (to dig the Iridium ore without trouble) on their own to avoid suspicion, which was why he poisoned Pali's environment using the plastic factory's waste.
GK kills his assistant because she revealed everything to Raju. GK then heads to Pali to kill all of the villagers before the truth goes out to the public. The village head warns GK that Raju is their God and that Raju will bring death to GK and keep the Pali's population at 534 and not let anyone die in the wrath of GK. Raju arrives at Pali along with Sidhappa. GK immediately shoots Sidhappa and kills him, reducing the population to 533. Raju angrily kills all of GK's goons, and severs GK's palm. A terrified GK starts escaping with Raju in pursuit. Raju catches up to him, and GK dies when a religious knife hanging from a nearby tree falls and stabs him in the neck. The village head finally reveals that Raju fulfilled his mission as God to save the village as, although Sidhappa was killed, another baby was born to keep the village's population at 534.

Critical reception[edit]
Sify rated 3 out of 5 explained "No doubt, Mahesh is the cynosure of the movie, shouldering the entire responsibility."[5] MSN rated 2.5 out of 5 and described the film as "just an above average venture", commenting, "Mahesh Khaleja is worth a watch for Mahesh's strong screen presence and charisma. Mahesh carries off his role with elan and looks superb too. Anushka looks pretty but doesn't share a good on-screen chemistry with Mahesh. The first half of the film is dull. It does pick up pace in the second half but the narration is inconsistent and tedious. The climax is little better.[6] Rediff gave a 2.5 out of 5 rating and noted "The duo of Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is watchable, entertaining with good humour, couple of well-orchestrated action sequences and songs and with a bit to take home as well. It's Mahesh's show all the way, much to the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the soul of the movie, be it his dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or emotions, he is effortless.[7]
CNN-IBN gave a negative review stating "The movie is all about Mahesh Babu and he occupies almost every frame in the movie. Back after a gap of 4 years, Mahesh looks great with stylish costumes. The movie deals with a serious theme but director Trivikram Srinivas mixes it with a lot of unnecessary situational comedy which dilutes the intensity of the movie."[8] Local review sites Idlebrain and GreatAndhra gave a 3 out of 5 and praised Mahesh's performance. The Hindu said "The star looks leaner and handsomer and does his role with aplomb" adding "The film is a laugh riot from the word go. Trivikram, who is also the dialogue writer, skillfully blends comical situations into the script and Mahesh Babu's timing in delivering the one-liners is excellent".
Audio release[edit]
The soundtrack was composed by Mani Sharma. The music was released on 27 September 2010.[9] The starcast of the movie, including Mahesh Babu, actress Anushka Shetty, music director Mani Sharma and director Trivikram Srinivas released the audio at Radio Mirchi FM radio station in the Hyderbad. Mahesh Babu's wife Namrata Shirodkar was also present. The album contains six songs and the lyrics are written by Ramajogayya Sastry and Sirivennela Sitaramasastri.[10] The film's audio was a huge success.

Cowards do that and that ain't you.....







There are some awesome people around us who are so very inspirational.







 We think we know them. What we do know is how they look and maybe a few of their achievements. On knowing what they have been through, the kind of hurdles they have overcome, the kind of loneliness they have encountered, it sends deep shivers down our spine. Helplessly, we find ourselves saying, "Wow". 

Here is one such story. I am sure you have heard about him and seen his photographs. I am sure a few of us have made good fun of him too. After reading this "Life School Message" I am sure you will be amazed by his story.

Please allow me to share with you the incredible story of the travails and glory of Sylvester Stallone. I sincerely believe, every person should be told this story. 

Have you ever wondered why Stallone has a unique expression on his face? He seems like talking with a drawl right? It seems like he is talking out of one corner of his mouth, right? Right!!! He was born with the lower part of his face, paralyzed. As a result of this, his speech was always slurred. It left him with parts of his tongue, lips and chin, paralyzed. 

Can a person like this 'dare' to become an actor and that too as a hero? Impossible, isn't it? Wouldn't this inability sound the death knell for an acting career? For everyone else, yes! For Stallone, no! Read on...

Just imagine the ridicule he would have been subjected to his entire childhood. It would have been so difficult for him to clearly express his thoughts, his emotions, in words. The sounds he would make wouldn't come out properly. He was an outcast among the school kids. He often received suspensions, for his squabbles and poor grades.

The first five years of his life, Stallone lived in an area known as Hell's Kitchen. He moved from one foster home to another as his parents fought miserably and endlessly in a bad marriage.

Stallone wanted to pursue an acting career. He tried out for nearly each and every casting call he could, and contacted as many casting agents as he could find. The result of every effort was a 'thumbs down'.

One day Stallone was watching on TV, a fight between Weppner and Mohammad Ali. Weppner was getting absolutely butchered but kept standing. He was refusing to give up. It was as if Weppner was taunting Mohammad Ali to keep hitting him. And he kept on coming back for more. This underdog was really fighting for it despite the negligible chance of winning.

This inspired Stallone to begin writing. He could not sleep the whole weekend and wrote the script for 'Rocky' in about three days’ time. 

He began trying to sell the screenplay to many producers with enormous numbers of rejections. This went on for months. Then, he found himself broke. He slept at the New Jersey Bus terminal for three weeks as he had no money to take a room.

In an act of desperation he waited outside of a local liquor store asking people if they would buy his dog; his closest and best friend. In the end someone bought his dog for roughly $50. Stallone was extremely devastated that his life had come to that point. He says, this was the lowest point of his life.

He kept pursuing this story that he had written. Eventually someone liked it and they agreed to buy his script for $ 35,000/-. He wanted to play the part of the hero, Rocky.

They declined and insisted he sell the script to them. Stallone disagreed and told them he was the perfect actor for the hero's role. He declined their offer despite his current poverty.A couple of weeks later they contacted him with an even higher offer and Stallone still insisted that he play Rocky. They once again declined. Can you believe this? The man was poor. He barely had money even for food.The offer kept rising just so he would sell them the film without playing the part. The price eventually got to around $3, 00, 000 and still he declined. He was certain that he was the perfect person to play the role of the hero and that was it. There would be no possibility of a compromise.Eventually they offered Stallone a measly $25000 for the script as well as acting. He accepted. Goodness gracious! Can you believe this? The first thing Stallone did was go back to the liquor store to buy back his dog.He waited 3 days for the guy to come by and finally the guy came. He offered the guy $150 to buy back the dog, the man declined. Stallone was clear what he wanted.It ended up costing him $15000 and a part in the movie to buy back his dog. The guy and the dog are in Rocky. The dog is credited as Butkus Stallone in the movie. Isn't that so cute? Imagine giving your pet, your name too. It makes my heart sing.

Rocky made about $200 million. Sequels followed. Till date Rocky has garnered over $1.25 billion.

Stallone lived by his statement in Rocky. 

Rocky Balboa: Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place, and I don’t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done! Now, if you know what you’re worth, then go out and get what you’re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain’t you. You’re better than that.

It won 10 nominations for the academy awards. It famously won the Academy Award for best picture in 1976. At the awards ceremony he read out all the rejection slips from those who said the film fill fail badly and no one would watch it.

How is this for persistence? How is this for believing in your dreams? How is this for winning against odds?

Are you inspired? If yes, please share this story with as many people as possible. Let’s touch as many lives as possible.

With loads of love, prayers and exceptional wishes.

  ATTITUDE........






  
  A little boy went into a drug store, reached for a soda carton and ask
  him for a Phone Call.


  Shop-owner replied Sweety this is no a STD, but you can do one call.


  The store-owner observed and listened to the conversation:



  The boy asked, "Lady, Can you give me the job of cutting your lawn?


  The woman replied, "I already have someone to cut my lawn."


  "Lady, I will cut your lawn for half the price of the person who cuts
  your lawn now." replied boy.


  The woman responded that she was very satisfied with the person who was
  presently cutting her lawn..


  The little boy found more perseverance and offered, "Lady, I'll even
  sweep your curb and your sidewalk, so on Sunday you will have the
  prettiest lawn in all of North-Palm beach, Florida."


  Again the woman answered in the negative.


  With a smile on his face, the little boy replaced the receiver.


  The store-owner, who was listening to all this, walked over to the boy
  and said," Son... I like your attitude; I like that positive spirit and
  would like to offer you a job."


  The little boy replied, "No thanks, I was just checking my performance
  with the job I already have.. I am the one who is working for that lady,
  I was talking to!"

Developing Leadership Skills










"  He who has never learned to obey cannot be a good commander."
                                                    - Airstotle 


Developing Leadership Skills:


No one is a born leader—everyone can develop leadership skills and everyone can benefit from using them.



First, take time to honestly analyze yourself.



Learn to understand yourself. It’s the first step to understanding others.



Consider these important questions:



1. What kind of leader am I? 

    One who helps solve problems? 

    A leader who helps people get along?

    How do others see me as a leader?



2. What are my goals, purposes, and expectations in working with this particular group?



Identify areas for improvement. Ask yourself these questions:



i. Do I try to be aware of how others think and feel?

ii. Do I try to help others perform to the best of their abilities?

iii. Am I willing to accept responsibility?

iv. Am I willing to try new ideas and new ways of doing things?

v. Am I able to communicate with others effectively?

vi. Am I a good problem solver?

vii. Do I accept and appreciate other perspectives and opinions?

viii. Am I aware of current issues and concerns on campus or in my community?



Then--after analyzing your strengths and weaknesses--take action.



Devise a strategy for upgrading your skills. Here are a few strategies to consider:




1) Communicate effectively. 

   Effective communication is dialogue. Barriers are created by speaking down to people, asking closed  questions that elicit yes or no answers, using excessive authority, and promoting a culture that depends on unanimity. If your focus is winning the argument or if you react defensively to criticism, you’ll create fear of openness and hinder the organization’s growth.



Try these steps to effective communication:

· Listen actively-ask open questions. Be genuinely interested in what other’s say.

· Thank people for their openness--stress how much you value it--even if you don’t like specifically what is being said.

· Point to areas of agreement before jumping on areas of disagreement-this reduces defensiveness; members wont fear being “attacked.”

· Set aside your authority to create an atmosphere of partnership to reduce fear in group members.

· Promote a culture of constructive dissent-though not to the point of paralysis.

· Portray disagreement as simply a difference of opinion. Get rid of the “I’m right,you’re wrong” attitude.



2) Encourage enthusiasm and a sense of belonging. 

   Show:

· Friendliness: others will be more willing to share ideas if you’re interested in them as people too.

· Understanding: everyone makes mistakes. Try to be constructive, tolerant and tactful when offering criticism.

· Fairness: equal treatment and equal opportunity lead to an equally good effort from all group members.

· Integrity: members will take tasks more seriously if you show that you’re more interested in group goals than your own personal gain.



3) Keep everyone working toward agreed upon goals:

· Remind everyone of the group’s purposes from time to time. It’s easy to become too narrowly focused and lose sight of the larger goals.

· Provide encouragement and motivation, by showing your appreciation for good ideas and extra effort.

· Harmonize differences and disagreements between group members by stressing compromise and cooperation.

· Involve everyone in discussions and decisions, even if asking for opinions and ideas means a longer discussion.



4) Get to know the people around you

Everyone has different abilities, wants, needs, and purpose in life. To get along with others and get results, you need to get to know them.

· Interact with group members as often as possible. The only way to get to know someone is through direct personal contact.

· Become familiar with every member of your group. Take note of each person’s unique qualities and characteristics.



5) Treat others as individuals

Put your knowledge and understanding of each group member to work!

· Be aware of expectations. Everyone expects something different: recognition, a chance to learn, a chance to work with other people, etc.

· Be creative. A repetitious routine can cause boredom. A successful leader thinks of new and better approaches to old ways of doing things.

· Provide rewards. Recognition by the group is a source of personal satisfaction and positive reinforcement for a job well done.

· Delegate responsibilities. If everyone shares the work, everyone can share pride in the group’s accomplishments. Let each member know what’s expected of him/her, available resources, deadlines, etc.



6) Accept responsibility for getting things done

· Take the initiative. Why stand around and wait for someone else to get things started? Set an example.

· Offer help and information. Your unique knowledge and skills may be just what’s needed.

· Seek help and information. Ask for advice if you need it. This will encourage group

involvement and help accomplish group goals.

· Make things happen. By being decisive, energetic, and enthusiastic, you can and will help get things done!

· Know when and how to say “no.” If your time and resources are already committed, turn down extra tasks, but do it nicely.



7) Problem solve in a step-by-step way

Whether you are faced with a decision to make or a conflict to resolve, following a logical approach will help.

1. State the problem as simply and clearly as possible.

2. Gather all relevant information and available resources.

3. Brainstorm as many ideas or solutions as you can think of (with others if possible).

4. Evaluate each idea or solution and choose the best one.

5. Design a plan for using your idea or solution. Include a timetable, assigned roles, and resources to be used.

6. Follow up on your plan by asking if your idea worked and why or why not.

A Story on Relationship and Trust













Little Girl and her Father were crossing a Bridge.

The Father was kind of scared so he asked his little daughter , " Sweet heart , please hold my hand so that you don't fall into the river".

The little girl said.

" No, Dad, You hold my Hand ."

With Puzzled mind Dad asks  " What's the difference ?

" There's a big Difference , " replied the Little Girl.

"If I Hold your hand and something happens to me, chances are that I may let your hand go.
 But if you hold my hand , I know for sure that no matter what happens , you will never let my hand go."

Moral of the Story:

" In any relationship , the essence of trust in not in its bind , but in its bond.So hold the hand of the person whom you love rather than expecting them to hold yours"

Sun comes down: Solar Power is becoming reality soon








The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has finally
concluded the bids for the second batch of Solar Photovoltaic power project
under the ambitious JNNSM program.

The process was handled by NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd
(NVVN), the power trading arm of NTPC, which has been nominated by the
Government to handle the Phase-I of the Solar Mission.

The curiosity on the allocations for projects with very low
bids by developers made this allocation one of the fiercest to date and brought
solar power much closer to wind as well as biomass sources.

Boom has started just like IT and Telecom has done earlier
in the 90’s .Now only wait and watch is how soon the global decreasing module
prices will bring down to grid parity soon. 

According to the sources the cost of generating 1 MW of
solar power has come down from Rs 25 Cr to Rs 11 Cr , this Batch II bidding has
created Rs 4,000 Cr business in India.

There’s still lot to come in this sector like how India can
meet its power deficit through Innovative solutions for the end user
through a Captive Power.

The NVVN bidding results are now out with the lowest bid for
5 MW starting at a mind numbing Rs. 7.49 per ($0.15) KWh submitted by Solaire
Direct who have in the past shown interest in using an all equity style of
funding. The band was between Rs. 7.49 at the lowest and Rs. 9.44 ($0.19) for
the highest bidding Green Infra.

rates are as below:

Mr. Mahesh R. Shetty, CMD, MT Educare Ltd. has more than 27 years of experience in the coaching industry. He started the business of providing coaching services to students in School Section in 1988 under the brand of Mahesh Tutorials. As Chairman and Managing Director, he provides vision, leadership and strategic guidance to MT Educare. Mr. Shetty is also the Promoter of the company. He was awarded the “Pride of the Nation Award” by the All India Achievers Association in 2008. Mr. Shetty holds a Bachelor’s degree in Science from the University of Mumbai.

Established in 1988, MT Educare Ltd. is one of the leading education support and coaching services provider in Maharashtra and has operations in other states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat. MT Educare also provides coaching for competitive examinations for admissions to universities offering masters in business administration degrees through its subsidiary Chitale’s Personalised Learning Private Limited. The Company got listed on BSE & NSE on April 12, 2012.

Speaking with Hemant P. Maradia of IIFL, Mr. Shetty says, “Spend on the Education sector is increasing. Almost a third of the income of middle-class families is going into Education.”

What prompted you to opt for the IPO? 
One was the visibility factor. We feel that the Education sector needs a lot of visibility in India. We wanted public exposure to dispel the myth that the Education sector is not scalable. 

We also wanted national and international exposure. We foresee synergies with international universities that are setting up shop in India. 

We also wanted to reward our faculties that have been with us for a long time. All of them have been given ESOPs. 

We also see some consolidation in the industry going forward, and we would like to be part of this process. 

How do you plan to use the IPO proceeds? 
Large part of the proceeds will be used for the college campus in Mangalore. Secondly, we are planning to set up 20 new coaching locations in FY13 and FY14. The balance IPO money will be utilised for general corporate purposes. 

The IPO was worth Rs 990mn; only Rs 350mn was inside the company. So, we are not talking of any large sum of money. 

Could you elaborate on your college tie-up in Karnataka? 
Basically, the Mangalore college campus is not owned by us; neither do we operate it. We basically are catering to the Test Prep for the college students. It is an 11th-12th science college.

We get revenues from three sources. First is from the Test Prep coaching. 

Secondly, we are doing Administrative Management of the college. We give them our content; we train their teachers. We also help them with the MIS, etc. We get an Administrative Management Fee. 

We would like to do more such ties-ups with colleges but we don’t want to invest. We have already entered into such tie-ups at Tumkur and Hubli in Karnataka post the IPO. 

These are all existing colleges. We have not put in any money. We currently provide them with just Test Prep coaching. Going forward, we would look at Administrative Management as well. 

We are focusing only on Karnataka as of now for this college model.

What will be the key growth drivers going ahead? 
We started in 1988. The areas that we would like to focus will in the Schools segment; we are also very strong in 11-12 Science and in Engineering Entrance Exam. Third area would be CPT and IPCC final. We have also launched classes for CS and CWA. 

We have also developed a technology platform, which we have launched for the 8th standard. We teach students ‘LIVE’ at home from our classrooms. The student doesn’t have to travel to our classes. We form a group of 8-10 students from the same school. We already have 125 students admitted for this platform. 

There is scope of scalability in every area. In Maharashtra itself, some 15 lakh students give the SSC Board exam every year. Out of that, we teach only about 15,000 students. So, there is enough to do there. 

Around 4 lakh students appear for Science exam every year in Maharashtra. Out of that we have around 4,000 students. Same goes for Commerce steam. 

We also see opportunity at the national level because of the joint entrance exam rule. 

Still, we would like to focus only on four states where we are present currently -Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. 

In Tamil Nadu, we are a very strong brand for CA. We are No.1 there in CA. So, there is a lot of scope in Tamil Nadu. This year, all-India CA final second rank student was from MT Educare. He is from Tamil Nadu. 

We have many rankers in CPT as well as in CA finals. 

We have keen interest in IIT-JEE as well. We are looking at the right opportunity. 

We have the college model in Karnataka. Then we are focusing in the SSC-HSC segment in Maharashtra. 

Stream-wise, 9-10 class growth is possible; then there is 11-12 Science and Engineering-Medical Entrance exam segments as well. There is CPT, IPCC and CA final segment. There is also the college model through which we run our classes. 

How do you see the outlook for the education sector? 
Spend on the Education sector is increasing. Almost a third of the income of middle-class families is going into Education, including formal as well as supplementary (coaching) education. Ours is the grade improvement business. Our deliverables are different compared to the Schools. K-12 schools are the Alma Matar of the children.  

We are here to ensure that the child performs better. We are also into customised teaching. This is a value-added service delivered with the help of audio-visual technology. Reproduction at the time of the exams is the most important deliverable for us. 

Also, India is becoming a knowledge-based economy now. The size of this industry is Rs 70bn in Maharashtra, which is a dominant state for us. The post-12 dropout rate has drastically reduced. 

More and more kids are getting enrolled and we are gradually becoming one nation, one exam kind of a system, be it Medical, Engineering or other professional courses. 

The Government has passed the Right to Education Act. So, the Government has taken up the responsibility to teach every child till the age of 14. 

In our opinion, it is the Sunrise sector. The industry as well as the Government is taking a keen interest in this sector. 

Private players like MT Educare are giving back to the society. We charge fees but also ensure that we impart quality education. We are employing various technologies; we ensure that teachers are trained in a particular fashion as well. 

So, the basic entry-level deliverables are improving, which was not the case earlier. Education was not looked upon as a viable career option by many teachers. But today they are earning quite well. We have given ESOPs to our faculty. 

We are focused on the outcome. There is no point in taking up the education mandate by not delivering. We are making sure that some students go for higher level of education like CA finals. Therefore, we have a great future and immense potential. 

We have studied the Tier II and Tier III markets as well. What we got to know is that the disposable income is not very high in these towns. We will either employ technology or go for school tie-ups or joint venture. 

We may also go for a hybrid model where the delivery of education is through technology but there are some contact classes as well. So, it will be easy on the pockets of the students of Tier II and Tier III cities. Also, the masses of these towns will get access to quality education at affordable rates. We are in the process of evolving these different models for these towns. 

What kind of investments are you looking at going forward?
Investments would be the rent and capex of Rs 1800-2000 per square feet. Upfront investments at each new location include security deposit and capex. 

We want to continue to be asset light and avoid capital-heavy models. We don’t want to get into K-12 because we don’t want to build schools. We don’t mind looking at K-12 from a different perspective like tie-ups but we are not interested in investing in that segment. 

None of our locations are owned by us; they are all leased locations operated by us. Three locations are run through the franchisee route. We do not want to focus on the franchisee model at all. 

What is the capacity of a typical MT Educare location?
One location has a capacity of 1400-1500 students. Physical capacity will be 240 seats but we rotate that capacity six times. There are different verticals at each location, such as Science, Commerce, etc. The number of classes we can take at each location varies from course to course.  

Are you able to find right kind of faculties? 
That is never an issue because we have been in this business for the past 24 years. Plus, we have taught lakhs of students over the years, who in turn can opt to become our faculty. It is never too difficult to get well qualified faculty. 

We also have a very good training workshop. A new teacher is trained roughly 200 hours. Even senior teachers go through 150 hours of training a year. 

Have you sold your pre-school business? 
We have signed a MoU with Tree House for the sale of our pre-School business. They have just completed the due diligence. 

Pre-school is an insignificant part of our business. It requires different kind of mindset and we do not want to use our management bandwidth in running that business. 

Are you looking at any acquisition(s)? 
We continue to look at opportunities. It has always been part of our growth process. We will be interested in a target which offers a good fit for us. Either it needs to be a new product line that adds to our value chain. Or it could be an existing product line that will add complement our current business. 

Do you have any diversification plan?
We do not have any diversification plans. We are contemplating how to develop the technology platform that we talked about before. But nothing has been crystallized at this point in time. 

What about the overseas markets? 
We cater to students in Dubai via a consultancy contract. Apart from that we are not looking at anything else for the overseas markets, at least not in the next one or two years.
