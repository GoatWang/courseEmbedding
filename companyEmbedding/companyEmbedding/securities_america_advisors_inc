Investors

Independent financial consultants
Whether you need to invest for retirement, your child’s education or for that dream vacation, look to an independent financial consultant from Securities America. When you work with an independent consultant, you can rest assured that the advice and guidance you receive is based on what’s best for YOU, and not because your advisor is hindered by a limited range of products or a corporate mandate dictating what they can sell or do.

Investing Clients Resources
Securities America Financial Corporation and its family of affiliated companies are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of investors. We want you to be fully informed when it comes to making investment decisions, and to be aware of how those choices and associated costs may impact you. Safeguarding your personal information and keeping it secure and private is a top priority for us.

Retirement Plans Information
Commissions & Trail Commissions – Details of commissions and/or trail commissions may vary by mutual fund and share class. Please refer to the prospectus document(s) related to your specific investment(s) for details. The prospectus documents are provided to you at the time of investment in the specific mutual fund. If needed, copies can be provided by your representative.
View ERISA Information

Bank Deposit Sweep Programs
The Bank Deposit Sweep Program is a core account investment vehicle used to hold your cash balance while awaiting reinvestment. The cash balance in your Brokerage Account(s) will be automatically deposited or “swept” into an interest-bearing FDIC-insured Program deposit account. Greater safety and competitive yield on the cash in your investment account – that’s why Securities America created the Bank Deposit Sweep Program, which provides up to $1.5 million maximum cumulative FDIC coverage and a competitive yield with deposits held at a network of multiple banks. Please refer to the Disclosure Document in Program Resources for additional information.

WHY JOIN SECURITIES AMERICA?

Award-Winning Technology
You need a company with technology that allows you to become more efficient, productive and profitable; technology that allows you to gain greater efficiency where it counts — with your clients. Our user-friendly integrated systems offer creative solutions to your business needs, delivered instantly to wherever you are and adjusting to meet your changing needs. To help facilitate your relationships with your clients, we offer Online Client Account Access and encrypted client email through Business Center Web Mail.

Award-Winning Practice Management Solutions
Securities America’s award-winning, forward-thinking coaching programs incorporate innovative techniques and exclusive tools proven to improve advisor satisfaction and profitability. Coaching has long been the cornerstone of our value proposition because, frankly, it works. Seventy percent of Securities America’s current million-dollar producers have advanced their business by engaging practice management through coaching, a study group or business consulting.

Acquisition, Succession & Continuity Planning Support
Financial advisors are dedicated to helping clients plan their financial futures, but sometimes they need help putting plans in place to ensure the smooth transitions of their own practices. Securities America recently introduced its Practice Transition Center, a first-of-its-kind library of videos and tools that help advisors understand and implement the process of buying or selling a practice.

Advisory & Wealth Management
We offer 400+ mutual fund wrap portfolios, more than any other independent broker-dealer, and 125+ separately managed account portfolios. Most recently, we’ve added Ladenburg’s proprietary money management programs to our Managed Opportunities platform. Advisors can manage the assets themselves, outsource to a third-party manager, or do a combination of both. Our Unified Managed Account was the first in the industry to allow separately managed accounts and mutual fund wraps in a single account – one set of paperwork, one registration and one 1099. Because we’re first to market with ideas like these, you can be first in your own market, giving you a significant edge over your competition.

Retirement Income Planning
NextPhase™ is Securities America’s industry-leading collection of programs, services, materials and education that advisors can leverage to effectively meet retirees’ income needs. As Baby Boomers enter the next phase of their lives, advisors need more than just a conceptual education designed to help these Boomer clients make their money last as long as they need. NextPhase provides an array of resources to help advisors manage clients’ income distribution needs. The resources include client-facing communications like marketing materials, risk assessments and documentation questionnaires, in addition to advisor resources like topic-specific white papers, strategy/product comparisons, calculators, forms, education and training information. Advisors want tangible tools to help meet these new challenges, and Securities America is leading the way.

Advisor-Centric Culture
At Securities America, good enough is never good enough. Through constant open communication with our advisors and assistants, and by putting ourselves in your shoes, we relentlessly pursue improvement to every facet of your experience. We measure key performance metrics to ensure we exceed the expectations of you, your staff and your clients. Many of our best technology and system enhancements were originally suggested by our advisors and assistants. Culture and service, though intangible, play a big part in a successful relationship with your broker-dealer. We invite you to visit our home office, meet our employees and experience for yourself what makes Securities America exceptional.

Securities America’s 2016 Connect Magazine Earns Platinum MarCom Award






Securities America was recently awarded a platinum MarCom award in the corporate category for its 2016 edition of Connect magazine. It also earned a gold MarCom award for its 2015 Connect magazine special edition focusing on women in the financial services industry.
The MarCom Awards is a creative competition for any individual or company involved in the concept, writing and design of print, visual, audio and web materials and programs. Entries come from corporate marketing and communication departments, advertising agencies, PR firms, design shops, production companies and freelancers from all 50 states and 35 countries.
With about 6,000 entries per year, the competition has grown to one of the largest of its kind in the world. Winners include a broad range of organizations from individuals to large media conglomerates and Fortune 50 companies.

“We’re honored to receive two of these prestigious awards for Connect magazine,” said Securities America Chief Marketing Officer Janine Wertheim. “Connect is the product of many hours of collaboration and hard work by our talented marketing team. This recognition confirms what many readers have already told us — Connect is a valuable and informative resource they turn to for a unique perspective on timely topics impacting the financial services industry.”

Earlier this year, the 2015 editions of Connect magazine and the Connect Special Edition were awarded Communicator Awards of Distinction from the Academy of Interactive and Visual Arts. The 2013 edition of Connect magazine earned an Apex award and a Gold MarCom award.

Securities America Receives Industry Award for Next Level Coaching Program






Securities America is the 2016 recipient of the WealthManagement.com Industry Award for Practice Management in the division of broker-dealers with more than 1,000 representatives.
The award is in recognition of Securities America’s Next Level Coaching with Revenue Diagnostic program. Since being introduced in 2008, this nine-month coaching program has continued to grow and evolve. The latest enhancement came in 2015 with the addition of the Revenue Diagnostic, which produces reports showing revenue by household, predictions for practice performance and assets by age. The diagnostic also includes two hours of consultation with a practice management expert.
Participants in 10 Next Level classes gathered, on average, 128 percent more assets in the 24 months after the program than they had in the 24 months leading up to it.  Advisors who completed the program increased their assets under management by an average of 81 percent over a randomly selected control group.
Securities America already has plans to update the Next Level program to help advisors adapt as new regulations such as the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule continue to reshape the financial services industry.

“We’re not going to stop here,” said Kirk Hulett, executive vice president of strategy and practice management. “We’re going to keep innovating with new practice management tools and coaching solutions to help advisors be the best owners and managers of a practice they can be, so they can provide great quality advice to their clients for life.”

Now in its second year, the WealthManagement.com Industry Awards program recognizes the companies and organizations that support financial advisor success to inspire innovation and leadership in the financial services industry.
The 2016 awards were presented Sept. 29 at a ceremony in New York City. Randy Reed, Securities America, vice president of application development, accepted the award for the firm.

The annual list ranks independent broker-dealers by the previous year’s total revenue.
Securities America finished 2016 with $536 million in total revenue. Securities America has consistently ranked in the top 10 for the past 17 years.
Eighty percent of the firms on the list saw an increase in revenue from fees representing an industry-wide shift away from commission-based business. At Securities America, assets under management in advisory business grew 19 percent, and advisory business grew from 49 percent of gross revenue to 51.2 percent of gross revenue.
Securities America’s success in 2016 was bolstered by its acquisition of certain assets of two independent broker-dealers, Wall Street Financial Group of Fairport, New York, now a branch known as Evolution Financial Advisors, and Foothill Securities, of Santa Clara, California. When they were acquired, Wall Street Financial Group had 67 advisors with approximately $11 million in annual gross revenue and $2.1 billion in client assets, and Foothill Securities had 210 advisors with 38 million in revenue and $5.14 billion in client assets.
In the past nine years, Securities America has developed industry-leading expertise in transitioning large groups of advisors. Over that time, it successfully completed nine transactions, bringing on board more than 1,000 advisors with approximately $127.8 million in revenue and about $14.9 billion in client assets.

“To move up in the top 10 in a year that presented so many challenges in the industry says a lot about our advisors and the people and processes we have in place,” said Securities America CEO and President Jim Nagengast. “In 2017, Securities America is poised to provide our advisors the support they’ll need for continued growth under the DOL fiduciary rule and other new regulations.”

Barron’s honors Securities America advisor Trudy Haussmann with spot in Top 100 Women Financial Advisors List






Securities America, Inc. congratulates Trudy Haussmann on being named one of Barron’s Top 100 Women Financial Advisors for 2017. This is Haussmann’s 12th continuous year on the prestigious list.

“It’s no surprise that year after year, Trudy Haussmann is named one of the top women advisors in the country,” said Janine Wertheim, Securities America Advisors president and chief marketing officer for Securities America. “Trudy is Securities America’s third highest ranking advisor as of yearend 2016, based on advisory assets under management.”

Haussmann is president and owner of Haussmann Financial, which has been one of Securities America’s top branches since 2004. She joined Securities America in 1991 and is a registered principal and a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERTM professional.
The award recognizes more than productivity. Barron’s ranks the advisors not only on the volume of assets overseen by the advisors and their teams and revenues generated for the firms but also the quality of advisors’ practices.

“It’s a reflection on the care Trudy and Haussmann Financial’s advisors give their clients, as well as their dedication to industry best practices,” Wertheim said.

About the Rankings

Barron’s Top Advisors
Barron’s publishes four financial advisor rankings each year: The Top 100, The Top 100 Women, The Top 100 Independents and The Top 1,000, in which advisors are ranked on a state-by-state basis. Advisors are chosen based upon a proprietary methodology consisting of three major components: assets under management, revenue generated for their firms, quality of service and regulatory records. Investment performance is not an explicit factor, because audited performance records are not available. Total assets are all assets overseen by the advisor’s team, including some that are held at other institutions. The rankings are based on data provided by individual advisors and their firms. Advisor data is confirmed via regulatory databases, cross-checks with securities firms and conversations with individual advisors. No compensation was received from participating firms or advisors. This ranking is not indicative of the advisor’s future performance.

Securities America Announces 2016 Assistant of the Year






Securities America is proud to announce Jennifer Telles of Jacob Young Financial Services in Watsonville, California, is the winner of its 2016 Assistant of the Year award.

“Jennifer is a perfect example of individual growth in this business; growth on a personal level, leadership growth, and professional growth, which has translated to growth of my business and assets under management,” said company founder and Certified Financial Planner® professional Jacob Young. “My business has grown since coming to Securities America in 2009, and Jennifer is a primary reason for that growth.”

To qualify, assistants must be nominated by a Securities America advisor, have a minimum of two years’ experience in the financial services industry and, if securities licensed, have a clean compliance record. This top assistant is also selected based on specific instances of service above and beyond expectations to clients, advisors and the firm; demonstrated leadership abilities; and personal and professional development.
Young nominated Telles for the award based on her exceptional attention to detail, professional growth and her ability to lead and coordinate assignments. In addition to Telles and Young, the firm employs two licensed advisors and three assistants.
After graduating from California State University Monterey Bay with a bachelor’s degree in management and international entrepreneurship in 2003, Telles joined the Jacob Young Financial Services as a part-time assistant. Today, she serves as client account manager, has earned Series 6 and 63 industry licenses and completed Securities America’s Assistant University.

“Professionally, Jennifer has moved from a part-time assistant who primarily assisted me with paperwork and client servicing, to a knowledgeable assistant who could take any role assigned to her,” Young said.

Securities America has a long history of providing support for sales assistants. 2017 marks the 20th year the independent broker-dealer has hosted its annual Assistant University, an intensive two-day workshop for both new and experienced office staff. This year’s event is scheduled for Oct. 5-6, in Omaha, Nebraska. It will include training in technology, compliance, marketing, operations, business management and practice management.
Securities America also offers these exclusive programs to help sales assistants grow professionally:

A Sales Assistant Advisory Board that provides Securities America suggestions and a sounding board for how to best equip and serve assistants to maximize effectiveness and efficiency.
Assistant certification training covering industry, product and firm-specific topics.
Fast Track training sessions to help assistants stay informed about changes in technology and procedures.
Assistant orientation with detailed resources to get new office staff up and running.
An annual National Conference with educational events tailored to assistants.

Whether you need to invest for retirement, your child’s education or for that dream vacation, look to an independent financial consultant from Securities America. When you work with an independent consultant, you can rest assured that the advice and guidance you receive is based on what’s best for YOU, and not because your advisor is hindered by a limited range of products or a corporate mandate dictating what they can sell or do.

We want you to be fully informed when it comes to making investment decisions, and to be aware of how those choices and associated costs may impact you.
