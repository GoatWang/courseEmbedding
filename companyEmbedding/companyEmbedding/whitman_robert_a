Our Customers Say...
The R.C. Gray Company's new team has been great to deal with. 
The prices are still the lowest I can find anywhere which allows my store to make a fair profit. Their hours are now 9-5, Monday through Friday which makes my life easier. The team is great to talk with, and has gotten all my orders out by the next day. I am glad they are now available online. I can't wait until I receive their new catalog!
