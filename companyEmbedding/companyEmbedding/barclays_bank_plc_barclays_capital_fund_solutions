Barclays OFI SteelPath MLP ETNs


USA - OFI Global







About Barclays OFI SteelPath MLP ETNs

The Barclays OFI SteelPath MLP ETNs offer exposure to the OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Strategy, and are linked to the Barclays OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Index (BXIIOSMS). The Index Constituents are selected for inclusion in the Index based on certain eligibility criteria, including distribution payment history, lower relative correlation to oil and natural gas prices, and size as measured by free-float market capitalization and average daily trading value.View OSMS product summary




Barclays & OFI Global Asset Management

OFI Global Asset Managements association with Barclays combines OFI SteelPaths experience and leadership within the energy infrastructure space with Barclays' strong brand and position in exchange-traded notes. The association expands OFI SteelPaths footprint beyond the mutual funds and separately managed accounts offered through the OFI Global Asset Management franchise, and provides another investment vehicle to better serve clients needs in this asset class.




About OFI Global Asset Management

OFI Global Asset Management consists of OppenheimerFunds, Inc. and certain of its advisory subsidiaries, including OFI Global Asset Management, Inc., OFI Global Institutional, Inc., OFI SteelPath, Inc. and OFI Global Trust Company. The firm offers a full range of investment solutions across equity, fixed income and alternative asset classes. As of March 31, 2015, the firm managed $237.42 billion in assets. Clients include institutional investors globally such as corporations, public funds, foundations and endowments, as well as retail mutual fund investors.






   Contact Us For all enquiries, please instruct your broker/advisor/custodian to email us at etndesk@barclays.com alternatively, your broker/custodian can call us at: 1-212-528-7790Barclays Capital Inc. acts as the issuer's agent in connection with the distribution of the iPath ETNs. Barclays Capital Inc. is an affiliate of Barclays Bank PLC and is a registered US broker-dealer regulated by the SEC and FINRA. 








 





An investment in any ETNs linked to the Barclays OFI SteelPath Midstream MLP Index (the "ETNs")  involves significant risks and may not be  suitable for all investors.  Selected  risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed  explanation of risks described under "Risk Factors" in the applicable prospectus  supplement and pricing supplement.  
You May Lose Some or All of  Your Principal:  The ETNs are exposed to any decrease in the  Volume Weighted Average Price ("VWAP") level between the inception date and the  applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the VWAP level is insufficient to  offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you  will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even  if the VWAP value has increased. Because the ETNs are subject to an investor  fee and any other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will always be lower  than the total return on a direct investment in the index components.    The ETNs are riskier than ordinary  unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.
Credit  of Barclays Bank PLC:  The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the  issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an  obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the  ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the  ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a  result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will  affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In  addition, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations,  you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs. 
Issuer  Redemption: Barclays Bank PLC will have the right to  redeem or "call" the ETNs (in whole but not in part) at its sole discretion and  without your consent on any trading day on or after the inception date until  and including maturity.  
The Payment on the ETNs is  Linked to the VWAP Level, Not to the Closing Level of the Index and Not to the  Published Intraday Indicative Value of the ETNs. Your payment at maturity  or upon early redemption is linked to the performance of the VWAP level, as  compared to the initial VWAP level. Although the VWAP level is intended to  track the performance of the Index, the calculation of the VWAP level is  different from the calculation of the official closing level of the Index.  Therefore, the payment at maturity or early redemption of your ETNs, may be  different from the payment you would receive if such payment were determined by  reference to the official closing level of the Index. 
No Guaranteed Coupon  Payments: You  are not guaranteed to receive coupon payments on the ETNs. You will receive a  coupon payment on a coupon payment date only to the extent that the accrued  dividend exceeds the accrued investor fee on the relevant coupon valuation  date. The amount of the accrued dividend on any coupon valuation date depends  in part on the aggregate cash value of distributions that a reference holder  would have been entitled to receive in respect of the index constituents prior  to the relevant coupon valuation date. 
Market and Volatility Risk: The  return on the ETNs is linked to the performance of the VWAP level of the Index  which, in turn, is linked to the performance of the master limited partnerships  and other securities that are included as index constituents at any time. The  prices of the index constituents may change unpredictably and, as a result,  affect the level of the Index and the value of your ETNs in unforeseeable ways. 
Concentration Risk: The  index constituents are companies in the Midstream  Oil & Gas and Liquid  Petroleum and Natural Gas Shippers categories, as determined by the Bloomberg  Industry Classification System® ("BCIS"). In addition, many of the  Index Constituents are smaller, non-diversified businesses that are exposed to  the risks associated with such businesses, including the lack of capital  funding to sustain or grow businesses and potential competition from larger,  better financed and more diversified businesses. The ETNs are susceptible to  general market fluctuations in the energy infrastructure and midstream energy  business MLP market and to volatile increases and decreases in value, as market  confidence in, and perceptions regarding the index constituents change. Your  investment may therefore carry risks similar to a concentrated securities  investment in one industry or sector.
A Trading Market for the  ETNs May Not Develop: Although the ETNs are listed on a  U.S. national securities exchange, a trading market for the ETNs may not  develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to  maintain any listing of the ETNs.
Restrictions on the Minimum  Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions for Redemptions: You must redeem at least 50,000 ETNs at one time in order to exercise your  right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date. You may only redeem your ETNs  on a redemption date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain  dates and times as set forth in the pricing supplement. Uncertain Tax Treatment:  Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs may be less favorable than  a direct investment in MLPs and are uncertain. You should consult your own tax  advisor about your own tax situation.Barclays Bank PLC has filed a registration  statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this  communication relates.  Before you  invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents Barclays Bank PLC  has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this  offering.  You may get these documents  for free by visiting www.etn.barclays.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.   Alternatively, Barclays Bank PLC will arrange for Barclays Capital  Inc. to send you the prospectus if you request it by  calling toll-free 1-877-764-7284, or you may request a copy  from any other dealer participating in the offering.
OppenheimerFunds  Distributor, Inc. ("OFDI"), doing business as OFI Global Asset Management,  assists in the promotion of the Barclays OFI SteelPath MLP ETNs. OFDI is not affiliated  with Barclays Capital Inc. or Barclays Bank PLC.
  The  ETNs may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage  account. Commissions may apply and there are tax consequences in the event of  sale, redemption or maturity of ETNs.

Barclays Capital Inc. acts as the issuer's agent in connection with the distribution of the Barclays ETNs. Barclays Capital Inc. is an affiliate of Barclays Bank PLC and is a registered US broker-dealer regulated by the SEC and FINRA.












Selected Risk ConsiderationsAn investment  in the Barclays ETNs described herein (the "ETNs") involves significant risks,  including possible loss of principal, and may not be suitable for all  investors. Selected  risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed  explanation of risks described under "Risk Factors" in the applicable  prospectus supplement and pricing supplement.   
You May Lose Some or All of  Your Principal:  The ETNs are exposed to any change in the level  of the underlying index, or the Volume Weighted Average Price ("VWAP") level,  in the case of the in the case of the Barclays ETN+ Select MLP ETN, between the  inception date and the applicable valuation date.  Additionally, if the level of the underlying  index or the VWAP level, is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the  investor fee and other applicable costs, you will lose some or all of your  investment at maturity or upon redemption, even if the value of such index or  the VWAP level has increased or decreased, as the case may be.  Because the ETNs are subject to an investor  fee and other applicable costs, the return on the ETNs will always be lower  than the total return on a direct investment in the index components.  The ETNs are riskier than ordinary  unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection.
Credit  of Barclays Bank PLC:  The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of the  issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an  obligation of or guaranteed by any third party.   Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or  upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its  obligations as they come due.  As a  result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will  affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or  redemption.  In addition, in the event  Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any  amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs.
A  Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop:  Although the ETNs are listed on a U.S. national  securities exchange, a trading market for the ETNs may not develop at any time  and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited, as we are not required to  maintain any listing of the ETNs.
No Interest Payments from the ETNs:  You  may not receive any interest payments on the ETNs.
Restrictions  on the Minimum Number of ETNs and Date Restrictions  for Redemptions:  You must redeem at least 20,0000, 25,000 or  50,000 (depending on the series) ETNs of the same series at one time in order to  exercise your right to redeem your ETNs on any redemption date.  You may only redeem your ETNs on a redemption  date if we receive a notice of redemption from you by certain dates and times  as set forth in the product prospectus.
Uncertain Tax Treatment: Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the  ETNs are uncertain. For ETNs linked to indices tracking MLPs, the tax treatment  of the ETNs may be less favourable than a direct investment in MLPs.  You should consult your own tax advisor about  your own tax situation.
Barclays Bank PLC has filed a registration  statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this  communication relates.  Before you  invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents Barclays Bank PLC  has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this  offering.  You may get these documents  for free by visiting etn.barclays.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.   Alternatively, Barclays Bank PLC will arrange for Barclays Capital  Inc. to send you the prospectus if you request it by  calling 1-212-528-7990, or you may request a copy  from any other dealer participating in the offering.
The ETNs may be sold throughout the day on the  exchange through any brokerage account. Commissions may apply and there are tax  consequences in the event of sale, redemption or maturity of ETNs.
