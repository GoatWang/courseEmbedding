Early life[edit]
McCarthy was born June 20, 1949, and was raised in Chicago’s Ashburn neighborhood. He graduated from St. Denis Grammar School and Leo Catholic High School. He then attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[1] He joined the Fightin Illini football team as a walk on his freshman year. He earned a football scholarship for his sophomore and played as strong safety his junior years before an injury ended his college career.[2] While there, he was a member of Delta Tau Delta.[3] He graduated in 1971 with a bachelor of science in finance and joined the United States Secret Service shortly thereafter.
Law enforcement career[edit]
His career included eight years assigned to the Presidential Protective Division in Washington D.C. and 14 years as a criminal investigator in Chicago. McCarthy was the special agent in charge of the Secret Service Chicago Division from 1989 until his retirement in October 1993.
Reagan assassination attempt[edit]
Main article: Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan




McCarthy (far right) moments before the attempted assassination of Reagan (waving). Left, in white trenchcoat, Jerry Parr, who pushed the President, body-sheltered by McCarthy, into the car.


When Hinckley opened fire, McCarthy put himself in the line of fire and spread his body in front of Reagan to make himself a target. He was struck in the abdomen by Hinckley's fourth bullet.[4] While all Secret Service agents are trained to take bullets for the president, only four have actually done so. Besides McCarthy, officer Leslie Coffelt of the White House Police Force was killed and officers Donald Birdzell and Joseph Downs were wounded in the 1950 Truman assassination attempt.
Post-Secret Service career[edit]
McCarthy has served as chief of the Orland Park Police Department since May 1994.
In 1997, he ran for the Democratic nomination for Illinois Secretary of State against Jesse White of Chicago, then the Recorder of Deeds for Cook County, and State Senator Penny Severns of Decatur.[2] Severns was removed from the ballot after failing to meet the signature requirement. McCarthy ran an outsider campaign that took a law-enforcement approach to the Secretary of State’s office including standardized DUI tests and easier to read license plates.[5] White won the primary election with 55% of the vote to McCarthy’s 45% of the vote, or a margin of 100,195 votes.[6]
In 1999, he earned a Master of Science degree in criminal/social justice from Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois.[7]
In March 2016, he was awarded the first annual Chief of Police of the Year award by the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police. The award cited his legislative advocacy, supervision of the building of the country’s first police station to receive a LEED Gold certification, working to establish the South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force, promoting crisis intervention training for officers and the use of NARCAN to prevent heroin overdoses.[8] In July 2016, he has served as the acting city manager of Orland Park. He will retain this role under a permanent city manager is found in a nationwide recruiting search.[1]
Private life[edit]
He is married and has three children.[7]

Early life[edit]
McCarthy was born June 20, 1949, and was raised in Chicago’s Ashburn neighborhood. He graduated from St. Denis Grammar School and Leo Catholic High School. He then attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[1] He joined the Fightin Illini football team as a walk on his freshman year. He earned a football scholarship for his sophomore and played as strong safety his junior years before an injury ended his college career.[2] While there, he was a member of Delta Tau Delta.[3] He graduated in 1971 with a bachelor of science in finance and joined the United States Secret Service shortly thereafter.
Law enforcement career[edit]
His career included eight years assigned to the Presidential Protective Division in Washington D.C. and 14 years as a criminal investigator in Chicago. McCarthy was the special agent in charge of the Secret Service Chicago Division from 1989 until his retirement in October 1993.
Reagan assassination attempt[edit]
Main article: Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan




McCarthy (far right) moments before the attempted assassination of Reagan (waving). Left, in white trenchcoat, Jerry Parr, who pushed the President, body-sheltered by McCarthy, into the car.


When Hinckley opened fire, McCarthy put himself in the line of fire and spread his body in front of Reagan to make himself a target. He was struck in the abdomen by Hinckley's fourth bullet.[4] While all Secret Service agents are trained to take bullets for the president, only four have actually done so. Besides McCarthy, officer Leslie Coffelt of the White House Police Force was killed and officers Donald Birdzell and Joseph Downs were wounded in the 1950 Truman assassination attempt.

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Timothy J Mccarthy7055 North AveOak Park, IL 60302(630) 279-3673Physicians & Surgeons, OphthalmologyWebsiteServicesFrom Business: Specalties:Primary: OphthalmologyBiography:Medical School: University of Osteopathic Medicine and Health SciencesGraduation Year: 1997Gender: MaleHospital Affilia…Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Timothy J McCarthy DO7638 W North AveElmwood Park, IL 60707(708) 452-4257Physicians & Surgeons,...WebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Timothy J McCarthy DO1200 S York StElmhurst, IL 60126(630) 279-3673Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Kruser, Timothy J, MD251 E Huron StChicago, IL 60611(312) 926-2520Physicians & Surgeons, Internal...WebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Dr. Timothy J Meehan, MD, MPH1740 W Taylor StChicago, IL 60612(312) 413-7492Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Stevens, Timothy J MD47 W Division StChicago, IL 60610(312) 944-7636Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Dr. Timothy J Bresnahan, MD183 N Addison AveElmhurst, IL 60126(630) 834-8450Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Lyman, Timothy J, MD1240 Il Route 83Bensenville, IL 60106(847) 228-6407Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection9. Mikesell, Timothy J, MD1775 Ballard RdPark Ridge, IL 60068(847) 318-2500Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection10. Laurie, Timothy J, MD1400 E Golf Rd Ste 117Des Plaines, IL 60016(847) 296-0666Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Timothy J.

About this book




What is AutoCAD? AutoCAD is the world's most popular computer-aided drafting package for the personal computer (PC). It is a fully functional 2D and 3D CAD program. Full 3D wire frame representation was incorporated in the program with the launch of Release 10 in 1988. Release 11 brought additional 3D facilities in­ cluding some solid modelling capabilities. These capabilities were enhanced with Release 12 of the program for DOS and Windows. Its popularity has made AutoCAD the de facto industry standard for PC-CAD with a host of other program developers providing application software conforming to the AutoCAD format. As a fully functional drafting program, AutoCAD can achieve anything that can be drawn on a drawing board. The main benefits of CAD come more from being able to edit and exchange drawing information rapidly rather than simply replacing the drawing board. Starting to use AutoCAD is a difficult step as it requires a certain amount of new skill development. Once you have made the commitment to learn how to use the program and implement it in your everyday work the benefits will soon accrue. You will quickly discover that there are many things that you can do with AutoCAD that you could never do with a drawing board. With AutoCAD your drawings become more than just black lines on a white sheet of paper. The AutoCAD drawing is a database of information.
