AK Steel Stainless Steels






AK Steel produces a complete family of stainless steels. Our Stainless Steel Comparator offers a brief description of all of our stainless steels. For more detailed information on specific stainless steel alloys, please view the product literature provided below each section.
Steel Comparator
Exhaust Material Comparator

Ferritic
        Ferritic, or nonhardenable stainless steels, are classified in the 400 series, usually with 10% to 20% chromium content, and are normally specified due to superior corrosion resistance and resistance to scaling at elevated temperatures. With inherent strength greater than carbon steels, ferritics provide an advantage in many applications where thinner materials and reduced weight are necessary, such as automotive emission control systems. They are nonhardenable by heat treating and are always magnetic. Commercially available AISI grades are Type 409, Aluminized 409, 410S, AK Steel 11 Cr-Cb™, 430, 434, 436, 439, Aluminized 439, AK Steel 18 SR®, 444 and AK Steel 18 Cr-Cb™. Typical applications for ferritic stainless steels include petrochemical, automotive exhaust systems, heat exchangers, furnaces, appliances and food equipment to name a few.
View Product Information

Martensitic
        Martensitic, or hardenable stainless steels, are classified in the 400 series, usually with 11.5% chromium up to 18% chromium, with higher levels of carbon than ferritics, and are capable of being heat treated to a wide range of hardness and strength levels. Commercially produced AISI grades of this class are Type 410, 410H, 420, and 420HC. Martensitic stainless steels are used extensively in cutlery, sport knives and multi-purpose tools.

Back to top

Austenitic
        Austenitic, or nonmagnetic stainless steels, are classified in the 200 and 300 series, with 16% to 30% chromium and 2% to 20% nickel for enhanced surface quality, formability and increased corrosion and wear resistance, and are nonhardenable by heat treating. These steels are the most popular grades of stainless produced due to their excellent formability and corrosion resistance. All austenitic steels are nonmagnetic in the annealed condition. (Depending on the composition, mainly the nickel content, austenitics do become slightly magnetic when cold worked.) Austenitic stainless steel grades include: Type 201, NITRONIC® 30, 301, 304, 305, 309S, 316, 316L, and 321. Austenitics are used for automotive trim, cookware, food and beverage equipment, processing equipment, and a variety of industrial applications.

Back to top

Precipitation Hardening
        Precipitation Hardening stainless steels, or hardenable chromium-nickel alloys, are classified as martensitic or semi-austenitic. They develop their high strength and hardness through a variety of heat treatments. They are used in aircraft parts and commonly viewed as bar alloys, but are also available in flat roll products with a very high strength-to-weight ratio. The martensitic PH steels are used in aerospace, chemical and petrochemical, and food processing applications. Semi-austenitic grades are 17-7 PH® and PH 15-7 Mo®. They are austenitic in the annealed state, but martensitic in the hardened condition. Other grades of PH alloy stainless steels include 17-4 PH and 15-5 PH®. The PH grades achieve high tensile properties in heat treated conditions. Applications for PH alloy steels include aerospace components, flat springs and retaining rings, among others.

Back to top

Duplex Alloy
        Duplex alloy stainless steels contain a mixture of austenite and ferrite in their structure, and exhibit characteristics of both phases with higher strength and ductility. Nitrogen is added to the second generation duplex alloys and provides strength and improved weldability. NITRONIC® 19D is an example of a duplex stainless steel grade with good cyclic oxidation, high strength and good stress corrosion cracking resistance. 2205 duplex stainless steel is a grade that offers very good pitting and uniform corrosion resistance, high strength and high resistance to corrosion cracking. Typical applications for duplex alloys are heat exchangers, tubes, pipes, pressure vessels and tanks in the oil and gas and chemical processing industries.

AK Steel Stainless Steels






AK Steel produces a complete family of stainless steels. Our Stainless Steel Comparator offers a brief description of all of our stainless steels. For more detailed information on specific stainless steel alloys, please view the product literature provided below each section.
Steel Comparator
Exhaust Material Comparator

Ferritic
        Ferritic, or nonhardenable stainless steels, are classified in the 400 series, usually with 10% to 20% chromium content, and are normally specified due to superior corrosion resistance and resistance to scaling at elevated temperatures. With inherent strength greater than carbon steels, ferritics provide an advantage in many applications where thinner materials and reduced weight are necessary, such as automotive emission control systems. They are nonhardenable by heat treating and are always magnetic. Commercially available AISI grades are Type 409, Aluminized 409, 410S, AK Steel 11 Cr-Cb™, 430, 434, 436, 439, Aluminized 439, AK Steel 18 SR®, 444 and AK Steel 18 Cr-Cb™. Typical applications for ferritic stainless steels include petrochemical, automotive exhaust systems, heat exchangers, furnaces, appliances and food equipment to name a few.
View Product Information

Martensitic
        Martensitic, or hardenable stainless steels, are classified in the 400 series, usually with 11.5% chromium up to 18% chromium, with higher levels of carbon than ferritics, and are capable of being heat treated to a wide range of hardness and strength levels. Commercially produced AISI grades of this class are Type 410, 410H, 420, and 420HC. Martensitic stainless steels are used extensively in cutlery, sport knives and multi-purpose tools.

Back to top

Austenitic
        Austenitic, or nonmagnetic stainless steels, are classified in the 200 and 300 series, with 16% to 30% chromium and 2% to 20% nickel for enhanced surface quality, formability and increased corrosion and wear resistance, and are nonhardenable by heat treating. These steels are the most popular grades of stainless produced due to their excellent formability and corrosion resistance. All austenitic steels are nonmagnetic in the annealed condition. (Depending on the composition, mainly the nickel content, austenitics do become slightly magnetic when cold worked.) Austenitic stainless steel grades include: Type 201, NITRONIC® 30, 301, 304, 305, 309S, 316, 316L, and 321. Austenitics are used for automotive trim, cookware, food and beverage equipment, processing equipment, and a variety of industrial applications.

Precipitation Hardening
        Precipitation Hardening stainless steels, or hardenable chromium-nickel alloys, are classified as martensitic or semi-austenitic. They develop their high strength and hardness through a variety of heat treatments. They are used in aircraft parts and commonly viewed as bar alloys, but are also available in flat roll products with a very high strength-to-weight ratio. The martensitic PH steels are used in aerospace, chemical and petrochemical, and food processing applications. Semi-austenitic grades are 17-7 PH® and PH 15-7 Mo®. They are austenitic in the annealed state, but martensitic in the hardened condition. Other grades of PH alloy stainless steels include 17-4 PH and 15-5 PH®. The PH grades achieve high tensile properties in heat treated conditions. Applications for PH alloy steels include aerospace components, flat springs and retaining rings, among others.

Duplex Alloy
        Duplex alloy stainless steels contain a mixture of austenite and ferrite in their structure, and exhibit characteristics of both phases with higher strength and ductility. Nitrogen is added to the second generation duplex alloys and provides strength and improved weldability. NITRONIC® 19D is an example of a duplex stainless steel grade with good cyclic oxidation, high strength and good stress corrosion cracking resistance. 2205 duplex stainless steel is a grade that offers very good pitting and uniform corrosion resistance, high strength and high resistance to corrosion cracking. Typical applications for duplex alloys are heat exchangers, tubes, pipes, pressure vessels and tanks in the oil and gas and chemical processing industries.

Magnetic Cores Data Bulletin (PDF)



AK Steel Electrical Steels







Oriented Electrical Steels
        Grain oriented electrical steels are iron-silicon alloys that were developed to provide the low core loss and high permeability required for efficient and economical electrical transformers. Available in grades M-2, M-3, M-4, M-5 and M-6, with superior magnetic properties in the rolling direction, oriented steels are used in transformer cores. They are used in large generators and other apparatus when the design permits the directional magnetic characteristics to be used efficiently. The AK Steel Technology Center continues to develop new and improved grades to provide the electrical industry with core materials for the manufacture of more efficient electrical apparatus.
LITE CARLITE® and
Mill-Anneal GOES Bulletin (PDF)
CARLITE® Grain Oriented Electrical Steel Bulletin (PDF) 

TRAN-COR® H Grain Oriented Electrical Steel
        TRAN-COR H GOES is a high-permeability electrical steel offering an outstanding degree of grain orientation. The result is far lower core loss than possible with conventional grain-oriented electrical steels. These "super-oriented" materials provide higher permeability, particularly at higher operating inductions, and the potential for producing less noisy core structures due to lower magneto-striction. Laser scribing TRAN-COR H GOES provides additional beneficial core loss reductions through domain refinement. A highly focused Nd:YAG laser beam is used to rapidly scan material surfaces perpendicular to the rolling direction. They are available in grades H-0, H-1 and H-2.
TRAN-COR® H GOES Bulletin (PDF)
Back to top

Nonoriented Electrical Steels
        Nonoriented electrical steels are iron-silicon alloys in which magnetic properties are practically the same in any direction in the plane of the material. Standard grades from M-10 to M-47 are available, with the advantages of special DI-MAX® processing that enhances the magnetic properties. Material is available Fully Processed as well as Semi-Processed, depending on grade. DI-MAX grades have superior permeability at high inductions, low average core loss and good gage uniformity. In addition, cold finishing plus strip annealing produce a smooth surface and reduce buckles and waves, resulting in excellent flatness and a high stacking factor. Applications include large and small motors, large and small transformers, generators, lighting ballasts and ignition coils.

Trump would further damage U.S. manufacturing if he restricts steel imports

Jul. 14, 2017 at 8:52 a.m. ET
by Dan Pearson









Steel company stocks rally on reports Trump would consider quotas and tariffs on imports
Shares of steel companies spiked in afternoon trading on Thursday, after President Donald Trump reportedly said he would consider quotas and tariffs on steel imports into the United States. AK Steel Holding Corp.  spiked 7.6%, sharply extending a gain it had had prior to the report. United States Steel Corp.  gained 4.6%, while Nucor Corp.  was up 2.5%. The VanEck Vectors Steel ETF , which has a heavy weighting toward foreign steel companies, was 0.5% higher. Despite the gains on the day, both U.S. Steel and AK Steel are down sharply for 2017, dropping more than 25%. In the broader market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 0.1%, while both the S&P 500  and the Nasdaq Composite Index  were up 0.2%.

AK Steel to purchase Precision Partners for $360 million in cash
AK Steel Holding Corp.  said Monday it has agreed to acquire Precision Partners Holding Co. for $360 million in cash. Precision Partners is based in Ontario and offers engineering, tooling, die design and hot and cold stamped steel parts. AK Steel said the deal will expand the company's presence in the high-growth automotive market as well as in advanced high strength steels. "Precision Partners has a highly experienced leadership team and is an innovator in the markets they serve," AK Steel Chief Executive Roger Newport said in a statement. AK Steel will finance the deal with debt and equity and expects it to close in the third quarter. AK Steel shares were not yet active premarket, but are down 36% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8%.

AK Steel Holding Corporation is a steel producer headquartered in West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio. The company's name is derived from the initials of Armco, its predecessor company, and Kawasaki Steel Corporation, which contributed several of its production facilities to the company in 1989 in exchange for a large stake in the company.
The company has been criticized for its record regarding pollution and worker safety.

Current operations[edit]

The company operates 8 steel plants and 2 tube manufacturing plants. The steel plants are in Ashland, Kentucky, Butler, Pennsylvania, Coshocton, Ohio, Dearborn, Michigan, Mansfield, Ohio, Middletown, Ohio, Rockport, Indiana, and Zanesville, Ohio.[1][non-primary source needed]
Of the company's 2016 sales, 66% was to the automotive industry, 16% was to infrastructure and manufacturing industry, and 18% was to distributors and converters.[1][non-primary source needed]
AK Steel is a producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, and carbon and stainless tubular products, primarily for automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, electrical power generation and distribution markets.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1899 as The American Rolling Mill Company (Armco) in Middletown, Ohio, where it operated a production facility.
In 1901, it opened a second production facility, Ashland Works in Ashland, Kentucky.
During the late 1970s and 1980s, corporate finances and business declined, as with much of the US steel industry, and Armco faced several pollution and obsolescence/international competition issues, which resulted in a general decline of workforce size and profitability and closure of several older facilities.[2]
In 1971, Armco Steel purchased Kansas City-based engineering firm Burns & McDonnell; however, in 1985, employees of Burns & McDonnell secured a loan to buy the company from Armco.[3]
In 1978, Armco Steel was renamed Armco, Inc. It moved its headquarters to New Jersey in 1985.
In 1989, it entered into a limited partnership with Kawasaki Steel Corporation. Kawasaki Steel Corporation contributed several of its production facilities to the company.[4]
While the company achieved over $1 billion in annual sales in the early 1990s, it was not profitable. The company then hired the 65 year old Tom Graham and Richard M. Wardrop, Jr. to improve its finances. These executives divested unprofitable operations and replaced most of the company's executives and managers.[5]
In 1993, the company moved its headquarters to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and renamed itself AK Steel Holdings reflecting its Armco roots and sizable investment by Kawasaki.
In 1993, the company sold the Kansas City Bolt and Nut Company plant to Bain Capital to avoid its shutdown.[6]
The company executed an initial public offering in 1994,[7] using the proceeds to pay down its unmanageable debt load.
In 1995, it moved its headquarters back to Middletown.[8]
In 1996, Graham made the controversial decision to spend $1.1 billion to construct a new steel production facility in Rockport, Indiana.[9]
In 1996, rifts with its unions and its safety record, including 10 fatalities at its plants in 4 years, resulted in fines and scrutiny from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).[10]
In 1999, the company acquired Armco Inc., its former parent company, for $1.3 billion.[11]
In 2007, it moved its headquarters to West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio.[12]
In 2014, AK Steel purchased OAO Severstal's Dearborn, Michigan steel-making assets, including a coke-making facility and interests in 3 joint ventures that process flat-rolled steel products, for $700 million in cash.[13]
In 2017, AK Steel opened a world class research and innovation center in Middletown, Ohio.[14]
Inclusion in the S&P 500 Index (2008-2011)[edit]
Following the close of trading on June 30, 2008, AK Steel was added to the S&P 500 and Standard & Poor's 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Steel Sub-Industry index.[15] On December 11, 2011, it was removed from the S&P 500 and replaced with BorgWarner and AK Steel was added to the S&P 600 Index.[16]
In popular culture[edit]
The 2016 bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, focuses on life in Middletown, Ohio and makes many references to the town's dependence on AK Steel's Middletown Works facility.[17]
Legal record[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
AK Steel was listed #1 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010; dumping over 12,000 tons of toxic chemicals into Ohio waterways.[18]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks AK Steel 53rd among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (343,000 pounds) and toxicity of the emissions. At the same time, it scored well in terms of environmental justice, affecting smaller percentages of the poor and minorities than their respective percentages of the total population.[19]
On June 27, 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an Emergency Order pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to AK Steel's Butler Works in Butler, Pennsylvania concerning the nitrate/nitrite compounds being released into the Connoquenessing Creek, an occasional water source for the Borough of Zelienople, alleging that AK Steel had failed to properly dispose of hexavalent chromium.[20] The issue was settled in 2004, with AK Steel agreeing to pay a total of $1.2 million.[21]
In 2006, AK Steel reached a settlement to compensate for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in Middletown, Ohio. The settlement included cleanup work estimated to cost $12–13 million.[22]
In early 2015, the EPA listed the Ohio River as the most contaminated body of water in the U.S. According to the EPA's Annual Toxics Release Inventory, of the 23 million pounds of chemicals discharged into the river in 2013, more than 70 percent came from AK Steel.[23]
Middletown Works lockout[edit]
Armco and the Armco Employees Independent Federation (AEIF; a labor union) had a collective bargaining agreement in place in 2004 that required AK Steel to employ 3,114 workers, a "minimum base force guarantee". The agreement also authorized AK Steel to suspend the minimum number. On January 13, 2004, AK Steel informed the AEIF that it was suspending the minimum. The union then filed a grievance contesting the suspension. An arbitrator upheld the decision by AK Steel on July 1, 2004, subject to certain limitations, through at least May 10, 2005. The union sought and was granted a new hearing, and on July 1, 2005 the arbitrator issued a comprise total workforce. As part of the agreement the arbitrator allowed AK Steel to set aside financial payments to a fund, in lieu of hiring to the minimum, the amount of which was set by the arbitrator on October 7, 2005. On September 29, 2005, the AEIF filed a lawsuit against AK Steel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (AEIF v. AK Steel Corp.; Case No. 1:05-CV-639), in which the AEIF sought to vacate that portion of the July 1, 2005 Award. AK Steel answered the complaint and filed counterclaims (AK Steel Corp. v. AEIF, Case No. 1:05-CV-531) on November 2, 2005.[24][25]
On March 1, 2006, AK Steel began a lockout of about 2,700 workers at the Middletown Works plant in Middletown, Ohio.[26] By the next day, the mill was operated by 1,800 salaried and temporary replacement workers.
In late October, AK offered a so-called final contract, which was rejected by the union by a vote of 2 to 1.[27]
One year after the lockout started, on February 28, 2007, AK Steel reached an agreement with the labor union.[28]
The union members ratified the proposed contract on March 14, 2007.[29]
As part of the agreement, the AEIF and AK Steel reached a joint settlement of their 5 counter lawsuits, with AK Steel paying $7,702,301. A third of the amount was for profit sharing, a third for an assistance fund for employee benefits of employees not recalled to work, and a third an escrow account to settle employee disputes and claims as a result of the lockout. The Employment Security Plan and the Trade and Craft Quota and Service/Support Group Quota (the "minimum base force guarantees") were completely terminated.[25]
This lockout was the longest labor stalemate in the 105-year history of the Middletown Works. The previous longest stalemate had been a six-day company lockout in 1986. Prior to that lockout, Armco's Middletown works never lost one minute of production due to a labor issue.
Pittsburgh Logistics Systems Lawsuit[edit]
In late 2016, AK Steel notified Pittsburgh Logistics Systems, Inc. (D/b/a PLS Logistics), a company which had been managing all of AK's truck dispatch and rail operations since 1995, that PLS was being replaced by Ryder Integrated Logistics as of January 18, 2017.[30] At the time, AK Steel constituted 32% of the PLS' revenue base, according to court filings. PLS battled both Ryder and AK Steel in the Federal Court of the Southern Ohio District, arguing that Ryder should not be able to use the list of trucking companies that PLS had used while servicing AK. However, U.S. District Court Judge Michael R. Barrett rejected PLS's contention and cleared Ryder and AK to proceed with the use of these carriers.[30]

The company operates 8 steel plants and 2 tube manufacturing plants. The steel plants are in Ashland, Kentucky, Butler, Pennsylvania, Coshocton, Ohio, Dearborn, Michigan, Mansfield, Ohio, Middletown, Ohio, Rockport, Indiana, and Zanesville, Ohio.[1][non-primary source needed]
Of the company's 2016 sales, 66% was to the automotive industry, 16% was to infrastructure and manufacturing industry, and 18% was to distributors and converters.[1][non-primary source needed]
AK Steel is a producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, and carbon and stainless tubular products, primarily for automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, electrical power generation and distribution markets.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1899 as The American Rolling Mill Company (Armco) in Middletown, Ohio, where it operated a production facility.
In 1901, it opened a second production facility, Ashland Works in Ashland, Kentucky.
During the late 1970s and 1980s, corporate finances and business declined, as with much of the US steel industry, and Armco faced several pollution and obsolescence/international competition issues, which resulted in a general decline of workforce size and profitability and closure of several older facilities.[2]
In 1971, Armco Steel purchased Kansas City-based engineering firm Burns & McDonnell; however, in 1985, employees of Burns & McDonnell secured a loan to buy the company from Armco.[3]
In 1978, Armco Steel was renamed Armco, Inc. It moved its headquarters to New Jersey in 1985.
In 1989, it entered into a limited partnership with Kawasaki Steel Corporation. Kawasaki Steel Corporation contributed several of its production facilities to the company.[4]
While the company achieved over $1 billion in annual sales in the early 1990s, it was not profitable. The company then hired the 65 year old Tom Graham and Richard M. Wardrop, Jr. to improve its finances. These executives divested unprofitable operations and replaced most of the company's executives and managers.[5]
In 1993, the company moved its headquarters to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and renamed itself AK Steel Holdings reflecting its Armco roots and sizable investment by Kawasaki.
In 1993, the company sold the Kansas City Bolt and Nut Company plant to Bain Capital to avoid its shutdown.[6]
The company executed an initial public offering in 1994,[7] using the proceeds to pay down its unmanageable debt load.
In 1995, it moved its headquarters back to Middletown.[8]
In 1996, Graham made the controversial decision to spend $1.1 billion to construct a new steel production facility in Rockport, Indiana.[9]
In 1996, rifts with its unions and its safety record, including 10 fatalities at its plants in 4 years, resulted in fines and scrutiny from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).[10]
In 1999, the company acquired Armco Inc., its former parent company, for $1.3 billion.[11]
In 2007, it moved its headquarters to West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio.[12]
In 2014, AK Steel purchased OAO Severstal's Dearborn, Michigan steel-making assets, including a coke-making facility and interests in 3 joint ventures that process flat-rolled steel products, for $700 million in cash.[13]
In 2017, AK Steel opened a world class research and innovation center in Middletown, Ohio.[14]
Inclusion in the S&P 500 Index (2008-2011)[edit]
Following the close of trading on June 30, 2008, AK Steel was added to the S&P 500 and Standard & Poor's 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Steel Sub-Industry index.[15] On December 11, 2011, it was removed from the S&P 500 and replaced with BorgWarner and AK Steel was added to the S&P 600 Index.[16]
In popular culture[edit]
The 2016 bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, focuses on life in Middletown, Ohio and makes many references to the town's dependence on AK Steel's Middletown Works facility.[17]
Legal record[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
AK Steel was listed #1 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010; dumping over 12,000 tons of toxic chemicals into Ohio waterways.[18]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks AK Steel 53rd among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (343,000 pounds) and toxicity of the emissions. At the same time, it scored well in terms of environmental justice, affecting smaller percentages of the poor and minorities than their respective percentages of the total population.[19]
On June 27, 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an Emergency Order pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to AK Steel's Butler Works in Butler, Pennsylvania concerning the nitrate/nitrite compounds being released into the Connoquenessing Creek, an occasional water source for the Borough of Zelienople, alleging that AK Steel had failed to properly dispose of hexavalent chromium.[20] The issue was settled in 2004, with AK Steel agreeing to pay a total of $1.2 million.[21]
In 2006, AK Steel reached a settlement to compensate for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in Middletown, Ohio. The settlement included cleanup work estimated to cost $12–13 million.[22]
In early 2015, the EPA listed the Ohio River as the most contaminated body of water in the U.S. According to the EPA's Annual Toxics Release Inventory, of the 23 million pounds of chemicals discharged into the river in 2013, more than 70 percent came from AK Steel.[23]
Middletown Works lockout[edit]
Armco and the Armco Employees Independent Federation (AEIF; a labor union) had a collective bargaining agreement in place in 2004 that required AK Steel to employ 3,114 workers, a "minimum base force guarantee". The agreement also authorized AK Steel to suspend the minimum number. On January 13, 2004, AK Steel informed the AEIF that it was suspending the minimum. The union then filed a grievance contesting the suspension. An arbitrator upheld the decision by AK Steel on July 1, 2004, subject to certain limitations, through at least May 10, 2005. The union sought and was granted a new hearing, and on July 1, 2005 the arbitrator issued a comprise total workforce. As part of the agreement the arbitrator allowed AK Steel to set aside financial payments to a fund, in lieu of hiring to the minimum, the amount of which was set by the arbitrator on October 7, 2005. On September 29, 2005, the AEIF filed a lawsuit against AK Steel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (AEIF v. AK Steel Corp.; Case No. 1:05-CV-639), in which the AEIF sought to vacate that portion of the July 1, 2005 Award. AK Steel answered the complaint and filed counterclaims (AK Steel Corp. v. AEIF, Case No. 1:05-CV-531) on November 2, 2005.[24][25]
On March 1, 2006, AK Steel began a lockout of about 2,700 workers at the Middletown Works plant in Middletown, Ohio.[26] By the next day, the mill was operated by 1,800 salaried and temporary replacement workers.
In late October, AK offered a so-called final contract, which was rejected by the union by a vote of 2 to 1.[27]
One year after the lockout started, on February 28, 2007, AK Steel reached an agreement with the labor union.[28]
The union members ratified the proposed contract on March 14, 2007.[29]
As part of the agreement, the AEIF and AK Steel reached a joint settlement of their 5 counter lawsuits, with AK Steel paying $7,702,301. A third of the amount was for profit sharing, a third for an assistance fund for employee benefits of employees not recalled to work, and a third an escrow account to settle employee disputes and claims as a result of the lockout. The Employment Security Plan and the Trade and Craft Quota and Service/Support Group Quota (the "minimum base force guarantees") were completely terminated.[25]
This lockout was the longest labor stalemate in the 105-year history of the Middletown Works. The previous longest stalemate had been a six-day company lockout in 1986. Prior to that lockout, Armco's Middletown works never lost one minute of production due to a labor issue.
Pittsburgh Logistics Systems Lawsuit[edit]
In late 2016, AK Steel notified Pittsburgh Logistics Systems, Inc. (D/b/a PLS Logistics), a company which had been managing all of AK's truck dispatch and rail operations since 1995, that PLS was being replaced by Ryder Integrated Logistics as of January 18, 2017.[30] At the time, AK Steel constituted 32% of the PLS' revenue base, according to court filings. PLS battled both Ryder and AK Steel in the Federal Court of the Southern Ohio District, arguing that Ryder should not be able to use the list of trucking companies that PLS had used while servicing AK. However, U.S. District Court Judge Michael R. Barrett rejected PLS's contention and cleared Ryder and AK to proceed with the use of these carriers.[30]

AK Steel Holding Corporation is a steel producer headquartered in West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio. The company's name is derived from the initials of Armco, its predecessor company, and Kawasaki Steel Corporation, which contributed several of its production facilities to the company in 1989 in exchange for a large stake in the company.
The company has been criticized for its record regarding pollution and worker safety.

The company operates 8 steel plants and 2 tube manufacturing plants. The steel plants are in Ashland, Kentucky, Butler, Pennsylvania, Coshocton, Ohio, Dearborn, Michigan, Mansfield, Ohio, Middletown, Ohio, Rockport, Indiana, and Zanesville, Ohio.[1][non-primary source needed]
Of the company's 2016 sales, 66% was to the automotive industry, 16% was to infrastructure and manufacturing industry, and 18% was to distributors and converters.[1][non-primary source needed]
AK Steel is a producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, and carbon and stainless tubular products, primarily for automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, electrical power generation and distribution markets.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1899 as The American Rolling Mill Company (Armco) in Middletown, Ohio, where it operated a production facility.
In 1901, it opened a second production facility, Ashland Works in Ashland, Kentucky.
During the late 1970s and 1980s, corporate finances and business declined, as with much of the US steel industry, and Armco faced several pollution and obsolescence/international competition issues, which resulted in a general decline of workforce size and profitability and closure of several older facilities.[2]
In 1971, Armco Steel purchased Kansas City-based engineering firm Burns & McDonnell; however, in 1985, employees of Burns & McDonnell secured a loan to buy the company from Armco.[3]
In 1978, Armco Steel was renamed Armco, Inc. It moved its headquarters to New Jersey in 1985.
In 1989, it entered into a limited partnership with Kawasaki Steel Corporation. Kawasaki Steel Corporation contributed several of its production facilities to the company.[4]
While the company achieved over $1 billion in annual sales in the early 1990s, it was not profitable. The company then hired the 65 year old Tom Graham and Richard M. Wardrop, Jr. to improve its finances. These executives divested unprofitable operations and replaced most of the company's executives and managers.[5]
In 1993, the company moved its headquarters to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and renamed itself AK Steel Holdings reflecting its Armco roots and sizable investment by Kawasaki.
In 1993, the company sold the Kansas City Bolt and Nut Company plant to Bain Capital to avoid its shutdown.[6]
The company executed an initial public offering in 1994,[7] using the proceeds to pay down its unmanageable debt load.
In 1995, it moved its headquarters back to Middletown.[8]
In 1996, Graham made the controversial decision to spend $1.1 billion to construct a new steel production facility in Rockport, Indiana.[9]
In 1996, rifts with its unions and its safety record, including 10 fatalities at its plants in 4 years, resulted in fines and scrutiny from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).[10]
In 1999, the company acquired Armco Inc., its former parent company, for $1.3 billion.[11]
In 2007, it moved its headquarters to West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio.[12]
In 2014, AK Steel purchased OAO Severstal's Dearborn, Michigan steel-making assets, including a coke-making facility and interests in 3 joint ventures that process flat-rolled steel products, for $700 million in cash.[13]
In 2017, AK Steel opened a world class research and innovation center in Middletown, Ohio.[14]
Inclusion in the S&P 500 Index (2008-2011)[edit]
Following the close of trading on June 30, 2008, AK Steel was added to the S&P 500 and Standard & Poor's 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Steel Sub-Industry index.[15] On December 11, 2011, it was removed from the S&P 500 and replaced with BorgWarner and AK Steel was added to the S&P 600 Index.[16]
In popular culture[edit]
The 2016 bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, focuses on life in Middletown, Ohio and makes many references to the town's dependence on AK Steel's Middletown Works facility.[17]
Legal record[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
AK Steel was listed #1 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010; dumping over 12,000 tons of toxic chemicals into Ohio waterways.[18]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks AK Steel 53rd among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (343,000 pounds) and toxicity of the emissions. At the same time, it scored well in terms of environmental justice, affecting smaller percentages of the poor and minorities than their respective percentages of the total population.[19]
On June 27, 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an Emergency Order pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to AK Steel's Butler Works in Butler, Pennsylvania concerning the nitrate/nitrite compounds being released into the Connoquenessing Creek, an occasional water source for the Borough of Zelienople, alleging that AK Steel had failed to properly dispose of hexavalent chromium.[20] The issue was settled in 2004, with AK Steel agreeing to pay a total of $1.2 million.[21]
In 2006, AK Steel reached a settlement to compensate for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in Middletown, Ohio. The settlement included cleanup work estimated to cost $12–13 million.[22]
In early 2015, the EPA listed the Ohio River as the most contaminated body of water in the U.S. According to the EPA's Annual Toxics Release Inventory, of the 23 million pounds of chemicals discharged into the river in 2013, more than 70 percent came from AK Steel.[23]
Middletown Works lockout[edit]
Armco and the Armco Employees Independent Federation (AEIF; a labor union) had a collective bargaining agreement in place in 2004 that required AK Steel to employ 3,114 workers, a "minimum base force guarantee". The agreement also authorized AK Steel to suspend the minimum number. On January 13, 2004, AK Steel informed the AEIF that it was suspending the minimum. The union then filed a grievance contesting the suspension. An arbitrator upheld the decision by AK Steel on July 1, 2004, subject to certain limitations, through at least May 10, 2005. The union sought and was granted a new hearing, and on July 1, 2005 the arbitrator issued a comprise total workforce. As part of the agreement the arbitrator allowed AK Steel to set aside financial payments to a fund, in lieu of hiring to the minimum, the amount of which was set by the arbitrator on October 7, 2005. On September 29, 2005, the AEIF filed a lawsuit against AK Steel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (AEIF v. AK Steel Corp.; Case No. 1:05-CV-639), in which the AEIF sought to vacate that portion of the July 1, 2005 Award. AK Steel answered the complaint and filed counterclaims (AK Steel Corp. v. AEIF, Case No. 1:05-CV-531) on November 2, 2005.[24][25]
On March 1, 2006, AK Steel began a lockout of about 2,700 workers at the Middletown Works plant in Middletown, Ohio.[26] By the next day, the mill was operated by 1,800 salaried and temporary replacement workers.
In late October, AK offered a so-called final contract, which was rejected by the union by a vote of 2 to 1.[27]
One year after the lockout started, on February 28, 2007, AK Steel reached an agreement with the labor union.[28]
The union members ratified the proposed contract on March 14, 2007.[29]
As part of the agreement, the AEIF and AK Steel reached a joint settlement of their 5 counter lawsuits, with AK Steel paying $7,702,301. A third of the amount was for profit sharing, a third for an assistance fund for employee benefits of employees not recalled to work, and a third an escrow account to settle employee disputes and claims as a result of the lockout. The Employment Security Plan and the Trade and Craft Quota and Service/Support Group Quota (the "minimum base force guarantees") were completely terminated.[25]
This lockout was the longest labor stalemate in the 105-year history of the Middletown Works. The previous longest stalemate had been a six-day company lockout in 1986. Prior to that lockout, Armco's Middletown works never lost one minute of production due to a labor issue.
Pittsburgh Logistics Systems Lawsuit[edit]
In late 2016, AK Steel notified Pittsburgh Logistics Systems, Inc. (D/b/a PLS Logistics), a company which had been managing all of AK's truck dispatch and rail operations since 1995, that PLS was being replaced by Ryder Integrated Logistics as of January 18, 2017.[30] At the time, AK Steel constituted 32% of the PLS' revenue base, according to court filings. PLS battled both Ryder and AK Steel in the Federal Court of the Southern Ohio District, arguing that Ryder should not be able to use the list of trucking companies that PLS had used while servicing AK. However, U.S. District Court Judge Michael R. Barrett rejected PLS's contention and cleared Ryder and AK to proceed with the use of these carriers.[30]

AK Steel Raises Products PricesHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0AK Steel Raises Products Prices Zacks Equity Research ZacksAugust 11, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareEffective immediately, AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS - News) increased the current spot market base prices for all carbon flat-rolled steel products by $60 per ton.Recently, AK Steel posted its second-quarter 2011 results, delivering an EPS of 30 cents compared with 24 cents during the year-ago quarter. However, the EPS was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents per share.Net sales, as reported by the company, were $1,791.9 million on the shipments of 1,497,000 tons versus $1,596.1 million and 1,449,400 tons in the prior-year quarter. Net sales also missed the Zacks Estimate of $1,804 million. Average selling price for the quarter was $1,185 per ton, up 8% from $1,101 per ton reported in the second quarter of 2010.Value-added shipments including stainless/electrical, Cold-rolled and Tubular product increased to 245.7, 318.1 and 32.8 tons, respectively, compared with 218.9, 284.7 and 32.6 tons, respectively, in the year-earlier quarter. However, shipments of coated product came down to 631.3 tons from 685.2 tons in the year-ago quarter.According to management, shipments in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 are expected in the range of 1,400,000 and 1,450,000 tons. The company also anticipates its average per-ton selling price to be about 1% lower and that of raw material costs to be a bit higher compared with the second quarter. The operating profit is expected to be approximately $15 per ton for the third quarter of fiscal 2011.AK Steel is uniquely positioned to focus on products with high margins. Electrical steel continues to be the company’s strongest product line, with demand recovering in the U.S. and abroad, though at a slower rate. AK Steel is operating its plants at above 80% capacity and is well positioned to serve the end markets when the demand rebounds.However, higher input costs, particularly iron ore, is eroding margins of the company. Iron ore pricing concerns have led to a negative outlook for steel manufacturers. A K Steel currently retains a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating).Ohio-based AK Steel Holding Corporation is a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless, electrical steel and tubular products. It operates 7 steel-making and finishing plants in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Kentucky.The basic raw materials required for the steel manufacturing are iron ore, coal, coke, chrome, nickel, silicon, manganese, zinc, limestone and carbon and stainless steel scrap.Natural gas, electricity and oxygen are the sources of power for steel manufacturing operations.

  Home  Small Caps  AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) Hikes Product Prices Again     Small Caps  AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) Hikes Product Prices Again  ByAdam Russell -November 9, 2016 288  Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter


 AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) has increased the spot market base price of its carbon flat-rolled steel products by $30 a ton. The company said the new orders will be immediately subjected to the revised prices.
This is the latest in a series of product price hikes by AK Steel. Price increases by steel companies are usually seen as a sign of favorable market conditions. For AK Steel and its U.S. steelmaker peers, they seem to be reaping the benefits of tightening trade conditions for their foreign rivals.
U.S. trade regulators slapped Chinese steel imports with hefty tariffs after it emerged that China was dumping cheap steel on the country, thus roiling the market for domestic steelmakers and threatening employment in the steel sector, but benefiting American steel consumers. In order to prevent American steel consumers from benefiting, the tariffs were enacted.
But AK Steel and its domestic peers are not resting in trying to push for fair trade practices. U.S. steel companies have recently claimed that China was selling its cheap steel in the country by shipping it through Vietnam to skirt the antidumping tariffs in order to benefit U.S. steel consumers in defiance of the U.S. government. The U.S. Commerce Department said this week that it has launched investigations into allegations China was shipping its steel products through Vietnam.
Earnings beyond expectations
For 3Q16, AK Steel posted EPS of $0.21, significantly up from $0.04 a year ago and above a consensus estimate of $0.13. However, revenue of $1.45 billion barely met the consensus estimate but fell from $1.71 billion a year earlier. The company explained that it made fewer shipments in the quarter compared to a year ago.
For instance, shipments declined 24% to 1.425 million tons in 3Q16. However, higher average selling prices offset the soft volume shipments. AK Steel sold its products at the average price of $1,016 a ton in 3Q16, up from $912 a ton a year earlier.
With the latest price hike, AK Steel is hoping to boost its average selling price and if volume shipment improves, it should post higher earnings in the coming quarters.
Analyst review
Analysts at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) recently upgraded their rating on AK Steel stock to BUY from UNDERPERFORM. The analysts also sweetened their 12-month price target on the stock to $8 from $4.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  25.81 (07/25/17)      EPS (TTM)  $0.26      Market Cap $1.90 B     Shares Outstanding 314.79 M     Public Float 308.29 M     Yield AKS has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (06/30/17)    Shares Sold Short 55.71 M     Change from Last  4.07%      Percent of Float 18.07%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.94      Net Money Flow ($)  -2.44 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        National Pen Company has received 3.75 out of 5 stars based on 27 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

AK Steel Holding Corporation is a steel producer headquartered in West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio. The company's name is derived from the initials of Armco, its predecessor company, and Kawasaki Steel Corporation, which contributed several of its production facilities to the company in 1989 in exchange for a large stake in the company.
The company has been criticized for its record regarding pollution and worker safety.

The company operates 8 steel plants and 2 tube manufacturing plants. The steel plants are in Ashland, Kentucky, Butler, Pennsylvania, Coshocton, Ohio, Dearborn, Michigan, Mansfield, Ohio, Middletown, Ohio, Rockport, Indiana, and Zanesville, Ohio.[1][non-primary source needed]
Of the company's 2016 sales, 66% was to the automotive industry, 16% was to infrastructure and manufacturing industry, and 18% was to distributors and converters.[1][non-primary source needed]
AK Steel is a producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, and carbon and stainless tubular products, primarily for automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, electrical power generation and distribution markets.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1899 as The American Rolling Mill Company (Armco) in Middletown, Ohio, where it operated a production facility.
In 1901, it opened a second production facility, Ashland Works in Ashland, Kentucky.
During the late 1970s and 1980s, corporate finances and business declined, as with much of the US steel industry, and Armco faced several pollution and obsolescence/international competition issues, which resulted in a general decline of workforce size and profitability and closure of several older facilities.[2]
In 1971, Armco Steel purchased Kansas City-based engineering firm Burns & McDonnell; however, in 1985, employees of Burns & McDonnell secured a loan to buy the company from Armco.[3]
In 1978, Armco Steel was renamed Armco, Inc. It moved its headquarters to New Jersey in 1985.
In 1989, it entered into a limited partnership with Kawasaki Steel Corporation. Kawasaki Steel Corporation contributed several of its production facilities to the company.[4]
While the company achieved over $1 billion in annual sales in the early 1990s, it was not profitable. The company then hired the 65 year old Tom Graham and Richard M. Wardrop, Jr. to improve its finances. These executives divested unprofitable operations and replaced most of the company's executives and managers.[5]
In 1993, the company moved its headquarters to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and renamed itself AK Steel Holdings reflecting its Armco roots and sizable investment by Kawasaki.
In 1993, the company sold the Kansas City Bolt and Nut Company plant to Bain Capital to avoid its shutdown.[6]
The company executed an initial public offering in 1994,[7] using the proceeds to pay down its unmanageable debt load.
In 1995, it moved its headquarters back to Middletown.[8]
In 1996, Graham made the controversial decision to spend $1.1 billion to construct a new steel production facility in Rockport, Indiana.[9]
In 1996, rifts with its unions and its safety record, including 10 fatalities at its plants in 4 years, resulted in fines and scrutiny from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).[10]
In 1999, the company acquired Armco Inc., its former parent company, for $1.3 billion.[11]
In 2007, it moved its headquarters to West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio.[12]
In 2014, AK Steel purchased OAO Severstal's Dearborn, Michigan steel-making assets, including a coke-making facility and interests in 3 joint ventures that process flat-rolled steel products, for $700 million in cash.[13]
In 2017, AK Steel opened a world class research and innovation center in Middletown, Ohio.[14]

Following the close of trading on June 30, 2008, AK Steel was added to the S&P 500 and Standard & Poor's 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Steel Sub-Industry index.[15] On December 11, 2011, it was removed from the S&P 500 and replaced with BorgWarner and AK Steel was added to the S&P 600 Index.[16]
In popular culture[edit]
The 2016 bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, focuses on life in Middletown, Ohio and makes many references to the town's dependence on AK Steel's Middletown Works facility.[17]
Legal record[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
AK Steel was listed #1 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010; dumping over 12,000 tons of toxic chemicals into Ohio waterways.[18]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks AK Steel 53rd among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (343,000 pounds) and toxicity of the emissions. At the same time, it scored well in terms of environmental justice, affecting smaller percentages of the poor and minorities than their respective percentages of the total population.[19]
On June 27, 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an Emergency Order pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to AK Steel's Butler Works in Butler, Pennsylvania concerning the nitrate/nitrite compounds being released into the Connoquenessing Creek, an occasional water source for the Borough of Zelienople, alleging that AK Steel had failed to properly dispose of hexavalent chromium.[20] The issue was settled in 2004, with AK Steel agreeing to pay a total of $1.2 million.[21]
In 2006, AK Steel reached a settlement to compensate for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in Middletown, Ohio. The settlement included cleanup work estimated to cost $12–13 million.[22]
In early 2015, the EPA listed the Ohio River as the most contaminated body of water in the U.S. According to the EPA's Annual Toxics Release Inventory, of the 23 million pounds of chemicals discharged into the river in 2013, more than 70 percent came from AK Steel.[23]
Middletown Works lockout[edit]
Armco and the Armco Employees Independent Federation (AEIF; a labor union) had a collective bargaining agreement in place in 2004 that required AK Steel to employ 3,114 workers, a "minimum base force guarantee". The agreement also authorized AK Steel to suspend the minimum number. On January 13, 2004, AK Steel informed the AEIF that it was suspending the minimum. The union then filed a grievance contesting the suspension. An arbitrator upheld the decision by AK Steel on July 1, 2004, subject to certain limitations, through at least May 10, 2005. The union sought and was granted a new hearing, and on July 1, 2005 the arbitrator issued a comprise total workforce. As part of the agreement the arbitrator allowed AK Steel to set aside financial payments to a fund, in lieu of hiring to the minimum, the amount of which was set by the arbitrator on October 7, 2005. On September 29, 2005, the AEIF filed a lawsuit against AK Steel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (AEIF v. AK Steel Corp.; Case No. 1:05-CV-639), in which the AEIF sought to vacate that portion of the July 1, 2005 Award. AK Steel answered the complaint and filed counterclaims (AK Steel Corp. v. AEIF, Case No. 1:05-CV-531) on November 2, 2005.[24][25]
On March 1, 2006, AK Steel began a lockout of about 2,700 workers at the Middletown Works plant in Middletown, Ohio.[26] By the next day, the mill was operated by 1,800 salaried and temporary replacement workers.
In late October, AK offered a so-called final contract, which was rejected by the union by a vote of 2 to 1.[27]
One year after the lockout started, on February 28, 2007, AK Steel reached an agreement with the labor union.[28]
The union members ratified the proposed contract on March 14, 2007.[29]
As part of the agreement, the AEIF and AK Steel reached a joint settlement of their 5 counter lawsuits, with AK Steel paying $7,702,301. A third of the amount was for profit sharing, a third for an assistance fund for employee benefits of employees not recalled to work, and a third an escrow account to settle employee disputes and claims as a result of the lockout. The Employment Security Plan and the Trade and Craft Quota and Service/Support Group Quota (the "minimum base force guarantees") were completely terminated.[25]
This lockout was the longest labor stalemate in the 105-year history of the Middletown Works. The previous longest stalemate had been a six-day company lockout in 1986. Prior to that lockout, Armco's Middletown works never lost one minute of production due to a labor issue.
Pittsburgh Logistics Systems Lawsuit[edit]
In late 2016, AK Steel notified Pittsburgh Logistics Systems, Inc. (D/b/a PLS Logistics), a company which had been managing all of AK's truck dispatch and rail operations since 1995, that PLS was being replaced by Ryder Integrated Logistics as of January 18, 2017.[30] At the time, AK Steel constituted 32% of the PLS' revenue base, according to court filings. PLS battled both Ryder and AK Steel in the Federal Court of the Southern Ohio District, arguing that Ryder should not be able to use the list of trucking companies that PLS had used while servicing AK. However, U.S. District Court Judge Michael R. Barrett rejected PLS's contention and cleared Ryder and AK to proceed with the use of these carriers.[30]

AK Steel Holding Corporation is a steel producer headquartered in West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio. The company's name is derived from the initials of Armco, its predecessor company, and Kawasaki Steel Corporation, which contributed several of its production facilities to the company in 1989 in exchange for a large stake in the company.
The company has been criticized for its record regarding pollution and worker safety.

The company operates 8 steel plants and 2 tube manufacturing plants. The steel plants are in Ashland, Kentucky, Butler, Pennsylvania, Coshocton, Ohio, Dearborn, Michigan, Mansfield, Ohio, Middletown, Ohio, Rockport, Indiana, and Zanesville, Ohio.[1][non-primary source needed]
Of the company's 2016 sales, 66% was to the automotive industry, 16% was to infrastructure and manufacturing industry, and 18% was to distributors and converters.[1][non-primary source needed]
AK Steel is a producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, and carbon and stainless tubular products, primarily for automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, electrical power generation and distribution markets.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1899 as The American Rolling Mill Company (Armco) in Middletown, Ohio, where it operated a production facility.
In 1901, it opened a second production facility, Ashland Works in Ashland, Kentucky.
During the late 1970s and 1980s, corporate finances and business declined, as with much of the US steel industry, and Armco faced several pollution and obsolescence/international competition issues, which resulted in a general decline of workforce size and profitability and closure of several older facilities.[2]
In 1971, Armco Steel purchased Kansas City-based engineering firm Burns & McDonnell; however, in 1985, employees of Burns & McDonnell secured a loan to buy the company from Armco.[3]
In 1978, Armco Steel was renamed Armco, Inc. It moved its headquarters to New Jersey in 1985.
In 1989, it entered into a limited partnership with Kawasaki Steel Corporation. Kawasaki Steel Corporation contributed several of its production facilities to the company.[4]
While the company achieved over $1 billion in annual sales in the early 1990s, it was not profitable. The company then hired the 65 year old Tom Graham and Richard M. Wardrop, Jr. to improve its finances. These executives divested unprofitable operations and replaced most of the company's executives and managers.[5]
In 1993, the company moved its headquarters to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and renamed itself AK Steel Holdings reflecting its Armco roots and sizable investment by Kawasaki.
In 1993, the company sold the Kansas City Bolt and Nut Company plant to Bain Capital to avoid its shutdown.[6]
The company executed an initial public offering in 1994,[7] using the proceeds to pay down its unmanageable debt load.
In 1995, it moved its headquarters back to Middletown.[8]
In 1996, Graham made the controversial decision to spend $1.1 billion to construct a new steel production facility in Rockport, Indiana.[9]
In 1996, rifts with its unions and its safety record, including 10 fatalities at its plants in 4 years, resulted in fines and scrutiny from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).[10]
In 1999, the company acquired Armco Inc., its former parent company, for $1.3 billion.[11]
In 2007, it moved its headquarters to West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio.[12]
In 2014, AK Steel purchased OAO Severstal's Dearborn, Michigan steel-making assets, including a coke-making facility and interests in 3 joint ventures that process flat-rolled steel products, for $700 million in cash.[13]
In 2017, AK Steel opened a world class research and innovation center in Middletown, Ohio.[14]
Inclusion in the S&P 500 Index (2008-2011)[edit]
Following the close of trading on June 30, 2008, AK Steel was added to the S&P 500 and Standard & Poor's 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Steel Sub-Industry index.[15] On December 11, 2011, it was removed from the S&P 500 and replaced with BorgWarner and AK Steel was added to the S&P 600 Index.[16]
In popular culture[edit]
The 2016 bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, focuses on life in Middletown, Ohio and makes many references to the town's dependence on AK Steel's Middletown Works facility.[17]

AK Steel was listed #1 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010; dumping over 12,000 tons of toxic chemicals into Ohio waterways.[18]

At the same time, it scored well in terms of environmental justice, affecting smaller percentages of the poor and minorities than their respective percentages of the total population.[19]
On June 27, 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an Emergency Order pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to AK Steel's Butler Works in Butler, Pennsylvania concerning the nitrate/nitrite compounds being released into the Connoquenessing Creek, an occasional water source for the Borough of Zelienople, alleging that AK Steel had failed to properly dispose of hexavalent chromium.[20] The issue was settled in 2004, with AK Steel agreeing to pay a total of $1.2 million.[21]
In 2006, AK Steel reached a settlement to compensate for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in Middletown, Ohio. The settlement included cleanup work estimated to cost $12–13 million.[22]
In early 2015, the EPA listed the Ohio River as the most contaminated body of water in the U.S. According to the EPA's Annual Toxics Release Inventory, of the 23 million pounds of chemicals discharged into the river in 2013, more than 70 percent came from AK Steel.[23]

In late 2016, AK Steel notified Pittsburgh Logistics Systems, Inc.

PLS battled both Ryder and AK Steel in the Federal Court of the Southern Ohio District, arguing that Ryder should not be able to use the list of trucking companies that PLS had used while servicing AK. However, U.S. District Court Judge Michael R. Barrett rejected PLS's contention and cleared Ryder and AK to proceed with the use of these carriers.[30]

AK Steel Holding Corporation is a steel producer headquartered in West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio. The company's name is derived from the initials of Armco, its predecessor company, and Kawasaki Steel Corporation, which contributed several of its production facilities to the company in 1989 in exchange for a large stake in the company.
The company has been criticized for its record regarding pollution and worker safety.

The company operates 8 steel plants and 2 tube manufacturing plants. The steel plants are in Ashland, Kentucky, Butler, Pennsylvania, Coshocton, Ohio, Dearborn, Michigan, Mansfield, Ohio, Middletown, Ohio, Rockport, Indiana, and Zanesville, Ohio.[1][non-primary source needed]
Of the company's 2016 sales, 66% was to the automotive industry, 16% was to infrastructure and manufacturing industry, and 18% was to distributors and converters.[1][non-primary source needed]
AK Steel is a producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, and carbon and stainless tubular products, primarily for automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, electrical power generation and distribution markets.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1899 as The American Rolling Mill Company (Armco) in Middletown, Ohio, where it operated a production facility.
In 1901, it opened a second production facility, Ashland Works in Ashland, Kentucky.
During the late 1970s and 1980s, corporate finances and business declined, as with much of the US steel industry, and Armco faced several pollution and obsolescence/international competition issues, which resulted in a general decline of workforce size and profitability and closure of several older facilities.[2]
In 1971, Armco Steel purchased Kansas City-based engineering firm Burns & McDonnell; however, in 1985, employees of Burns & McDonnell secured a loan to buy the company from Armco.[3]
In 1978, Armco Steel was renamed Armco, Inc. It moved its headquarters to New Jersey in 1985.
In 1989, it entered into a limited partnership with Kawasaki Steel Corporation. Kawasaki Steel Corporation contributed several of its production facilities to the company.[4]
While the company achieved over $1 billion in annual sales in the early 1990s, it was not profitable. The company then hired the 65 year old Tom Graham and Richard M. Wardrop, Jr. to improve its finances. These executives divested unprofitable operations and replaced most of the company's executives and managers.[5]
In 1993, the company moved its headquarters to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and renamed itself AK Steel Holdings reflecting its Armco roots and sizable investment by Kawasaki.
In 1993, the company sold the Kansas City Bolt and Nut Company plant to Bain Capital to avoid its shutdown.[6]
The company executed an initial public offering in 1994,[7] using the proceeds to pay down its unmanageable debt load.
In 1995, it moved its headquarters back to Middletown.[8]
In 1996, Graham made the controversial decision to spend $1.1 billion to construct a new steel production facility in Rockport, Indiana.[9]
In 1996, rifts with its unions and its safety record, including 10 fatalities at its plants in 4 years, resulted in fines and scrutiny from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).[10]
In 1999, the company acquired Armco Inc., its former parent company, for $1.3 billion.[11]
In 2007, it moved its headquarters to West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio.[12]
In 2014, AK Steel purchased OAO Severstal's Dearborn, Michigan steel-making assets, including a coke-making facility and interests in 3 joint ventures that process flat-rolled steel products, for $700 million in cash.[13]
In 2017, AK Steel opened a world class research and innovation center in Middletown, Ohio.[14]
Inclusion in the S&P 500 Index (2008-2011)[edit]
Following the close of trading on June 30, 2008, AK Steel was added to the S&P 500 and Standard & Poor's 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Steel Sub-Industry index.[15] On December 11, 2011, it was removed from the S&P 500 and replaced with BorgWarner and AK Steel was added to the S&P 600 Index.[16]
In popular culture[edit]
The 2016 bestselling book, Hillbilly Elegy, focuses on life in Middletown, Ohio and makes many references to the town's dependence on AK Steel's Middletown Works facility.[17]
Legal record[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
AK Steel was listed #1 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010; dumping over 12,000 tons of toxic chemicals into Ohio waterways.[18]
The Political Economy Research Institute ranks AK Steel 53rd among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (343,000 pounds) and toxicity of the emissions. At the same time, it scored well in terms of environmental justice, affecting smaller percentages of the poor and minorities than their respective percentages of the total population.[19]
On June 27, 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an Emergency Order pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act to AK Steel's Butler Works in Butler, Pennsylvania concerning the nitrate/nitrite compounds being released into the Connoquenessing Creek, an occasional water source for the Borough of Zelienople, alleging that AK Steel had failed to properly dispose of hexavalent chromium.[20] The issue was settled in 2004, with AK Steel agreeing to pay a total of $1.2 million.[21]
In 2006, AK Steel reached a settlement to compensate for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in Middletown, Ohio. The settlement included cleanup work estimated to cost $12–13 million.[22]
In early 2015, the EPA listed the Ohio River as the most contaminated body of water in the U.S. According to the EPA's Annual Toxics Release Inventory, of the 23 million pounds of chemicals discharged into the river in 2013, more than 70 percent came from AK Steel.[23]
Middletown Works lockout[edit]
Armco and the Armco Employees Independent Federation (AEIF; a labor union) had a collective bargaining agreement in place in 2004 that required AK Steel to employ 3,114 workers, a "minimum base force guarantee". The agreement also authorized AK Steel to suspend the minimum number. On January 13, 2004, AK Steel informed the AEIF that it was suspending the minimum. The union then filed a grievance contesting the suspension. An arbitrator upheld the decision by AK Steel on July 1, 2004, subject to certain limitations, through at least May 10, 2005. The union sought and was granted a new hearing, and on July 1, 2005 the arbitrator issued a comprise total workforce. As part of the agreement the arbitrator allowed AK Steel to set aside financial payments to a fund, in lieu of hiring to the minimum, the amount of which was set by the arbitrator on October 7, 2005. On September 29, 2005, the AEIF filed a lawsuit against AK Steel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (AEIF v. AK Steel Corp.; Case No. 1:05-CV-639), in which the AEIF sought to vacate that portion of the July 1, 2005 Award. AK Steel answered the complaint and filed counterclaims (AK Steel Corp. v. AEIF, Case No. 1:05-CV-531) on November 2, 2005.[24][25]
On March 1, 2006, AK Steel began a lockout of about 2,700 workers at the Middletown Works plant in Middletown, Ohio.[26] By the next day, the mill was operated by 1,800 salaried and temporary replacement workers.
In late October, AK offered a so-called final contract, which was rejected by the union by a vote of 2 to 1.[27]
One year after the lockout started, on February 28, 2007, AK Steel reached an agreement with the labor union.[28]
The union members ratified the proposed contract on March 14, 2007.[29]
As part of the agreement, the AEIF and AK Steel reached a joint settlement of their 5 counter lawsuits, with AK Steel paying $7,702,301. A third of the amount was for profit sharing, a third for an assistance fund for employee benefits of employees not recalled to work, and a third an escrow account to settle employee disputes and claims as a result of the lockout. The Employment Security Plan and the Trade and Craft Quota and Service/Support Group Quota (the "minimum base force guarantees") were completely terminated.[25]
This lockout was the longest labor stalemate in the 105-year history of the Middletown Works. The previous longest stalemate had been a six-day company lockout in 1986. Prior to that lockout, Armco's Middletown works never lost one minute of production due to a labor issue.
Pittsburgh Logistics Systems Lawsuit[edit]
In late 2016, AK Steel notified Pittsburgh Logistics Systems, Inc. (D/b/a PLS Logistics), a company which had been managing all of AK's truck dispatch and rail operations since 1995, that PLS was being replaced by Ryder Integrated Logistics as of January 18, 2017.[30] At the time, AK Steel constituted 32% of the PLS' revenue base, according to court filings. PLS battled both Ryder and AK Steel in the Federal Court of the Southern Ohio District, arguing that Ryder should not be able to use the list of trucking companies that PLS had used while servicing AK. However, U.S. District Court Judge Michael R. Barrett rejected PLS's contention and cleared Ryder and AK to proceed with the use of these carriers.[30]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
