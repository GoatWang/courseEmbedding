PROJECT OVERVIEW
 

 
Location and Access

The Winston District Gold Project is situated 18 miles (30 kilometres) southeast of the capital of Helena, and approximately 2 miles (3.2 kilometres) southwest of the small community of Winston. There is year-round access by paved highway, a major powerline intersecting the property and a railroad siding within two kilometres.
The Winston Mining District is located 37 kilometers southeast of Helena, Montana. There is year-round access by paved highway. Electrical power and a railroad siding are located close to the district, which is two kilometers north of the highway.

 
Past Production


 The Winston property hosts two past producing mines; the Custer and Edna mines.
 The district has a rich history of mining dating back to the 1867, with an estimated total district production of 100,000 ounces of gold from 150,000 tons of ore (an average grade of 0.67 ounces/ton or 22.8 g/t gold).
 Historic records indicate that the Custer Mine was a major contributor to the overall district production estimate.
 The Custer Vein was mined continuously for over 2400 ft (732 metres) on five primary levels.
 Very little mining was performed below the 400 ft level (4,180 ft elevation).
 The Custer and Edna mines were in production sporadically from 1930 to 1955.

 
Opportunity

The Winston property deposits are classified as steeply dipping syn-tectonic fissure quartz-sulfide vein systems that have the potential to extend to considerable depths.
Very little mining was performed below the 400 foot level (4,180 feet elevation) of the Custer Vein and Management believes the vein may extend for at least another 500 feet (150 metres) below this level, giving the potential for new resources measuring 2,400 feet laterally, 500 feet vertically and averaging up to 4 feet in width.
The historic development of the #1 and #2 Winze down to the 300 ft level (on the western end of the vein system) indicates the presence of high-grade Mineralization. Historically miners would only develop secondary shafts (known as Winzes) to quickly access high grade or from above. This was faster and cheaper than developing a long drift from the primary shaft. There is no reason why this high-grade zone under the #1 and#2 Winze does not continue.
Six holes of the 2014 program cut significant intercepts in veins on the western side of the Edna intrusive. This identified eight new vein targets that were never before mined. This vein trend is 500 feet long and remains open to the east, west and at depth.
Montana’s Small Miners permit will allow the company to access test and mine these vein systems quickly.
It is management’s intention to confirm and extend mineralization at the Custer and Edna mines and commence test mining at a rate of 150 tons per day ramping up to 230 tpd if warranted.
The structure of the Custer and Edna vein systems and competent nature of the surrounding wall rocks should allow the Company to utilize the very cost effective Shrinkage Stoping mining method for its operations.

Stocks: 15 minute delay, EST. Futures and Forex: 10 minute delay, CST.) and new delayed trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash").  Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively.

High Grade. Low Cost.Near-Term Gold Production Gold has regained its
luster in the market and we believe that the next precious metal super-cycle is
just commencing. The timing could not be better to position ourselves as
efficient and cost effective gold miners. We’ve put together a world-class team
who have done it several times before and we plan to replicate that success.
Our expert team has acquired two exciting high-grade gold projects and plans to
quickly advance both of these assets into low-cost, profitable mining
operations.The company has an un-common goal (and they’ve done it before):  Be on pace to produce 50,000      oz/year of gold by month 18 Spend less than $10,000,000 Acquire Growth  Property #1- Montana Location and Access The Winston District Gold Project is situated 18 miles (30 kilometres) southeast of the capital of Helena, and approximately 2 miles (3.2 kilometres) southwest of the small community of Winston. There is year-round access by paved highway, a major powerline intersecting the property and a railroad siding within two kilometres. The Winston Mining District is located 37 kilometers southeast of Helena, Montana. There is year-round access by paved highway. Electrical power and a railroad siding are located close to the district, which is two kilometers north of the highway. Past Production  The Winston property hosts two past      producing mines; the Custer and Edna mines. The district has a rich history of      mining dating back to the 1867, with an estimated total district      production of 100,000 ounces of gold from 150,000 tons of ore (an average      grade of 0.67 ounces/ton or 22.8 g/t gold). Historic records indicate that the      Custer Mine was a major contributor to the overall district production      estimate. The Custer Vein was mined continuously      for over 2400 ft (732 metres) on five primary levels. Very little mining was performed below      the 400 ft level (4,180 ft elevation). The Custer and Edna mines were in      production sporadically from 1930 to 1955.  Opportunity The Winston property deposits are classified as steeply dipping syn-tectonic fissure quartz-sulfide vein systems that have the potential to extend to considerable depths. Very little mining was performed below the 400 foot level (4,180 feet elevation) of the Custer Vein and Management believes the vein may extend for at least another 500 feet (150 metres) below this level, giving the potential for new resources measuring 2,400 feet laterally, 500 feet vertically and averaging up to 4 feet in width. The historic development of the #1 and #2 Winze down to the 300 ft level (on the western end of the vein system) indicates the presence of high-grade Mineralization. Historically miners would only develop secondary shafts (known as Winzes) to quickly access high grade or from above. This was faster and cheaper than developing a long drift from the primary shaft. There is no reason why this high-grade zone under the #1 and#2 Winze does not continue. Six holes of the 2014 program cut significant intercepts in veins on the western side of the Edna intrusive. This identified eight new vein targets that were never before mined. This vein trend is 500 feet long and remains open to the east, west and at depth. Montana’s Small Miners permit will allow the company to access test and mine these vein systems quickly. It is management’s intention to confirm and extend mineralization at the Custer and Edna mines and commence test mining at a rate of 150 tons per day ramping up to 230 tpd if warranted. The structure of the Custer and Edna vein systems and competent nature of the surrounding wall rocks should allow the Company to utilize the very cost effective Shrinkage Stoping mining method for its operations. Click here for more information on the Winston District Gold Project Property #2 - Arizona Location and Access The Gold Ridge Property is located in north central Cochise County in southeastern Arizona in the southern foothills of the Dos Cabezas Mountains, approximately 16-miles east-southeast of Willcox, Arizona. Willcox is approximately eighty-five miles east of Tucson, Arizona and lies along U.S. Interstate Highway 10. Modern services and accommodations are available in Willcox and it is served by the Southern Pacific Railway. The property lies on a County maintained gravel road about two and a half miles northeast of the settlement of Dos Cabezas. Past Production  Gold production on the Gold Ridge      Property was sourced principally from the Gold Prince mine. Two other      mines exist on the property; the Gold Ridge and Dives mines, both saw only      minor production. The Gold Prince Mine produced 22,000      ounces of gold from multiple gold veins with grades averaging 0.344 ounces      gold per ton (11.79 grams gold per tonne). The mine was in production sporadically      over a period 16 years between 1932 and 1996. Gold prince has a total of 5,862 ft of      underground development on 6 levels and ore-bearing veins are reported to      average 3-to-6 feet in width, and dip from 50° to 75°.  Opportunity Gold Mineralization on the Gold Ridge Property is described as “Mesothermal” which indicates that the vein system at the Gold Prince Mine may continue to considerable depth. This is a common characteristic of mesothermal vein systems worldwide. 

  The Gold Prince mine was only mined down 5 levels and development was just commencing on the 6th level when production stopped in 1996. From 1986 until the mine closed in 1996 the mine was producing silica flux material (from the quartz vein) for the Hidalgo Copper Smelter, operated by Phelps Dodge. The gold was recovered as a byproduct in the smelting process. Production at Gold Prince ceased when the copper smelter was shut down, not because the mine was out of ore. Recovering precious metals from narrow, high-grade vein systems is Management’s specialty. Since the Gold Prince mine has an extensive historic drill database (486 underground and surface drill holes totaling 27,774 ft), the company has access to an excellent opportunity to quickly and cost effectively identify additional minable mineralization. Both the hanging and footwall sections of the vein system are stable and the mineralization is well suited for shrinkage stoping mining methods requiring minimal startup and sustaining capital expenditures. It is management’s intention to confirm and extend mineralization at the Gold Prince mine and then acquire the necessary permits to commence test mining at an initial rate of 150 tons per day. Executive Team Harold (Mike) Gunsinger Director of Operations Mike has over 5 decades of experience in putting mines into production. From 1982 - 1985 Mike worked as the mine manager for the Renabi Gold Mine, rehabbing a 3400 ft deep mine and bringing the mine back into production at 650 tpd. This mine was later sold to Barrick and was Barrick’s first operating gold mine. From 1995 - 1996 Mike worked at the Kennecott Copper mine in underground development. In 2000 Mike was mine manager for Placer Dome’s Mussel White Mine in Northern Ontario where he oversaw a 14 month project involving the installation of a 4000 tpd crusher and one mile of conveyor way from underground to the mill. In 2006 Mike was instrumental in the successful re-opening of the historic Drumlummon Gold Mine in Montana, overseeing all aspects of operations from exploration to mine development and planning. This mine restarted production in 2010 on time and on budget.  Murray Nye CEO and Director Murray served in the capacity of President/CEO of RX Exploration. Murray’s communication skills and business acumen were an asset in the formation of key relationships within the financial community which enhanced the advancement of RX Exploration within North America and Europe. Murray along with Mike Gunsinger were responsible for acquiring, permitting and hiring key personnel to explore and develop the Drumlummon Mine. Murray was also instrumental in raising over $35 million for RX Exploration. All of which went towards advancing the Drumlummon mine. With Murray at the helm, the company’s market capitalization increased from $1.5 million to about $80 million as the historic mine was brought into pilot production, on time and on budget. Max Polinsky President, CFO and Director Max has a proven track record, having served RX Exploration, an $80 million dollar market cap company as both CFO and Director. Max is largely credited in bringing the historic Drumlummon Mine back in to profitable production following its nearly 100 year departure from use. His operational experience has been an integral component to the formation of both RX Exploration and Winston Gold. Max has a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) degree from the University of Manitoba majoring in Finance. Ben Porterfield Director (M.Sc. University of Arizona). Ben is a consultant geologist who has worked in mineral exploration for 30 years. He discovered the Northern Belle deposit in Nevada, the Stone Cabin deposit in Idaho, and the Terra deposit in Alaska, while working for Nerco Minerals and Kennecott Exploration.

High Grade. Low Cost.Near-Term Gold ProductionGold has regained its luster in the market and we believe that the next precious metal super-cycle is just commencing. The timing could not be better to position ourselves as efficient and cost effective gold miners. We’ve put together a world-class team who have done it several times before and we plan to replicate that success. Our expert team has acquired two exciting high-grade gold projects and plans to quickly advance both of these assets into low-cost, profitable mining operations.
The company has an un-common goal (and they’ve done it before):

Be on pace to produce 50,000 oz/year of gold by month 18
Spend less than $10,000,000
Acquire Growth
Property #1- Montana


Location and AccessThe Winston District Gold Project is situated 18 miles (30 
kilometres) southeast of the capital of Helena, and approximately 2 
miles (3.2 kilometres) southwest of the small community of Winston. 
There is year-round access by paved highway, a major powerline 
intersecting the property and a railroad siding within two kilometres.
The Winston Mining District is located 37 kilometers southeast of 
Helena, Montana. There is year-round access by paved highway. Electrical
 power and a railroad siding are located close to the district, which is
 two kilometers north of the highway.

Past Production
 The Winston property hosts two past producing mines; the Custer and Edna mines.

	The district has a rich history of mining dating back to the 1867, with
 an estimated total district production of 100,000 ounces of gold from 
150,000 tons of ore (an average grade of 0.67 ounces/ton or 22.8 g/t 
gold).
	
 Historic records indicate that the Custer Mine was a major contributor to the overall district production estimate.
 The Custer Vein was mined continuously for over 2400 ft (732 metres) on five primary levels.
 Very little mining was performed below the 400 ft level (4,180 ft elevation).
 The Custer and Edna mines were in production sporadically from 1930 to 1955.
OpportunityThe Winston property deposits are classified as steeply dipping 
syn-tectonic fissure quartz-sulfide vein systems that have the potential
 to extend to considerable depths.
Very little mining was performed below the 400 foot level (4,180 feet
 elevation) of the Custer Vein and Management believes the vein may 
extend for at least another 500 feet (150 metres) below this level, 
giving the potential for new resources measuring 2,400 feet laterally, 
500 feet vertically and averaging up to 4 feet in width.
The historic development of the #1 and #2 Winze down to the 300 ft 
level (on the western end of the vein system) indicates the presence of 
high-grade Mineralization. Historically miners would only develop 
secondary shafts (known as Winzes) to quickly access high grade or from 
above. This was faster and cheaper than developing a long drift from the
 primary shaft. There is no reason why this high-grade zone under the #1
 and#2 Winze does not continue.
Six holes of the 2014 program cut significant intercepts in veins on 
the western side of the Edna intrusive. This identified eight new vein 
targets that were never before mined. This vein trend is 500 feet long 
and remains open to the east, west and at depth.
Montana’s Small Miners permit will allow the company to access test and mine these vein systems quickly.
It is management’s intention to confirm and extend mineralization at 
the Custer and Edna mines and commence test mining at a rate of 150 tons
 per day ramping up to 230 tpd if warranted.
The structure of the Custer and Edna vein systems and competent 
nature of the surrounding wall rocks should allow the Company to utilize
 the very cost effective Shrinkage Stoping mining method for its 
operations.

Property #2 - Arizona
Location and AccessThe Gold Ridge Property is located in north central Cochise County in
 southeastern Arizona in the southern foothills of the Dos Cabezas 
Mountains, approximately 16-miles east-southeast of Willcox, Arizona.
Willcox is approximately eighty-five miles east of Tucson, Arizona 
and lies along U.S. Interstate Highway 10. Modern services and 
accommodations are available in Willcox and it is served by the Southern
 Pacific Railway.
The property lies on a County maintained gravel road about two and a half miles northeast of the settlement of Dos Cabezas.

Past Production

Gold production on the Gold Ridge Property was 
sourced principally from the Gold Prince mine. Two other mines exist on 
the property; the Gold Ridge and Dives mines, both saw only minor 
production.
	

	The Gold Prince Mine produced 22,000 ounces of gold from multiple gold 
veins with grades averaging 0.344 ounces gold per ton (11.79 grams gold 
per tonne).
	
 The mine was in production sporadically over a period 16 years between 1932 and 1996.

	Gold prince has a total of 5,862 ft of underground development on 6 
levels and ore-bearing veins are reported to average 3-to-6 feet in 
width, and dip from 50° to 75°.
	
OpportunityGold Mineralization on the Gold Ridge Property is described as 
“Mesothermal” which indicates that the vein system at the Gold Prince 
Mine may continue to considerable depth. This is a common characteristic
 of mesothermal vein systems worldwide.
The Gold Prince mine was only mined down 5 levels and development was
 just commencing on the 6th level when production stopped in 1996.
From 1986 until the mine closed in 1996 the mine was producing silica
 flux material (from the quartz vein) for the Hidalgo Copper Smelter, 
operated by Phelps Dodge. The gold was recovered as a byproduct in the 
smelting process.
Production at Gold Prince ceased when the copper smelter was shut down, not because the mine was out of ore.
Recovering precious metals from narrow, high-grade vein systems is Management’s specialty.
Since the Gold Prince mine has an extensive historic drill database 
(486 underground and surface drill holes totaling 27,774 ft), the 
company has access to an excellent opportunity to quickly and cost 
effectively identify additional minable mineralization.
Both the hanging and footwall sections of the vein system are stable 
and the mineralization is well suited for shrinkage stoping mining 
methods requiring minimal startup and sustaining capital expenditures.
It is management’s intention to confirm and extend mineralization at 
the Gold Prince mine and then acquire the necessary permits to commence 
test mining at an initial rate of 150 tons per day.

Executive TeamHarold (Mike) GunsingerDirector of Operations
Mike has over 5 decades of experience in putting mines into production. From 1982 - 1985 Mike worked as the mine manager for the Renabi Gold Mine, rehabbing a 3400 ft deep mine and bringing the mine back into production at 650 tpd. This mine was later sold to Barrick and was Barrick’s first operating gold mine. From 1995 - 1996 Mike worked at the Kennecott Copper mine in underground development. In 2000 Mike was mine manager for Placer Dome’s Mussel White Mine in Northern Ontario where he oversaw a 14 month project involving the installation of a 4000 tpd crusher and one mile of conveyor way from underground to the mill. In 2006 Mike was instrumental in the successful re-opening of the historic Drumlummon Gold Mine in Montana, overseeing all aspects of operations from exploration to mine development and planning. This mine restarted production in 2010 on time and on budget.
