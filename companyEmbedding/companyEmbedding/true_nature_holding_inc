(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Quarterly Report"). Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared and, unless otherwise stated, the information derived therefrom as presented in this discussion and analysis is presented, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  The information contained in this Quarterly Report is not a complete description of our business or the risks associated with an investment in our common stock. We urge you to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this Quarterly Report and in our other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and subsequent reports on Form 8-K, which discuss our business in greater detail. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" in this Item 2 and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report refer to True Nature Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.  In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "will", "may", "should", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "predicts", "forecasts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All statements made in this Quarterly Report other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and reflect only our current views, expectations and assumptions with respect to future events and our future performance. If risks or uncertainties materialize or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results or events could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Risks that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make include, among others, risks related to: our ability to successfully implement our business plan, develop and commercialize our proprietary formulations in a timely manner or at all, identify and acquire additional proprietary formulations, manage our pharmacy operations, service our debt, obtain financing necessary to operate our business, recruit and retain qualified personnel, manage any growth we may experience and successfully realize the benefits of our acquisitions and collaborative arrangements we may pursue; competition from pharmaceutical companies, outsourcing facilities and pharmacies; general economic and business conditions; regulatory and legal risks and uncertainties related to our pharmacy operations and the pharmacy and pharmaceutical business in general; physician interest in and market acceptance of our current and any future formulations and compounding pharmacies generally; our limited operating history; and the other risks and uncertainties described under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update any forward-looking statement for any reason.  Overview  We are an early stage company that intends to acquire a series of businesses which specialize in compounding pharmacy activities, largely direct to consumers, and to doctors and veterinary professionals.  Description of Pharmaceutical Compounding  The vast majority of medications are mass-produced by pharmaceutical drug companies. They aim to treat a specific medical condition for a large segment of people. Problems can arise when a patient has a medical condition that can't be treated by one of these mass-produced products. Pharmaceutical compounding (done in compounding pharmacies) is the creation of a particular pharmaceutical product prescribed by doctors to fit the unique needs of a patient that can't be met by commercially available drugs. To do this, compounding pharmacists combine or process appropriate ingredients using various tools. This may be done for medically necessary reasons, such as to change the form of the medication from a solid pill to a liquid, to avoid a non-essential ingredient that the patient is allergic to, or to obtain the exact dose(s) needed or deemed best of particular active pharmaceutical ingredient(s). It may also be done for more optional reasons, such as adding flavors to a medication or otherwise altering taste or texture. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles. Compounding pharmacies (and pharmacists) adhere to standards and regulations set by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, National Association of Boards and State Boards of Pharmacy for quality assurance and accuracy. The compounding pharmacy business has the potential to provide high margins, and allow the pharmacy to specialize is certain solutions for specific maladies, so it can target specific markets efficiently.  We intend to focus on the acquisition of compounders who have a) a large client base in the veterinary area, b) a strong set of proprietary compounding solutions, versus non-proprietary "over-the-counter" (OTC) medicine sales, and  We expect economies of scale from the consolidation of:   Materials procurement;  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  Critical Accounting Policies  In the first quarter of 2017, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in the section "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2016 Form 10-K.  Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.  Results of Operations  The following period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily indicative of results for the current period or any future period. In particular, our pharmacy operations activities will commence in the third quarter of 2017 and we have spun-out the prior year educational business which is presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. This change in the nature of our operations will have and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our financial results. As a result, our results of operations in the periods after commencement of our pharmacy operations will include aggregate revenue and expense amounts and the apportionment of expenses among categories, have changed and are expected to continue to change as we further develop these operations. Further, as a result of our acquisitions of our compounding pharmacies, and any additional pharmacy acquisitions or other such transactions we may pursue, we may experience large expenditures specific to the transactions that are not incident to our operations.  For the Three Months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016  There are no continuing operating sales and related cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Our total operating expenses for the three months period ended March 31, 2017 pertaining to continuing operations were $228,368. For the same periods in 2016, the continuing operating expense was $832,369. They were comprised primarily of expenses of pertaining $111,153 compensation expense and $21,142 professional fees related to SEC and audit filings services and legal expense.  There is $4,911, of interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017, pertaining to interest incurred for outstanding debentures that were not converted resulting from the convertible promissory notes.  For the three month period ended March 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss of $223,279. For the same period in 2016, the Company had a loss of $838,587.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities. As of March 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of $1,107,744. Our working capital deficit is attributable to the fact that we began implementing the Company's business plan of acquiring pharmaceutical compounding businesses.  During the three months ending March 31, 2017, the Company had negative cashflow from Operations of $21,945. This was mainly offset through the net proceeds from the sale of common stock and promissory notes combined totaling $22,000.  Specific details related to our financing activities are as follows:  2017 Private Placements  During the three months ended March 31, 2017 we raised gross proceeds of 22,000 through the sale of 200,000 shares of common stock to a new board member at a price of $0.11 per share.  Plan of Operations  During 2016, and following the acquisition, and subsequent deconsolidation of P3, we revised our approach to the business strategy, and added the concept of incorporating a retail, more traditional, pharmacy business with the compounding pharmacy we had originally focused on. We also decided to develop a library of intellectual properties (IP), including specialized formulations and compounds of pharmaceutical materials, as well as potential software and systems, into a dedicated subsidiary. While we expect immediate financial results from the retail and compounding areas, we believe the IP and technology business will require substantial time to mature into a profitable business.  As a result of this revised approach, the Company intends to create three (3) wholly owned subsidiaries to hold its operations.  The first, "TN Retail, LLC" will hold its retail storefront operations. These storefront locations will provide both conventional pharmacy products, as well as unique compounding based solutions. The store will focus on "healthy, holistic and natural solutions", along the lines of a "Whole Foods of Pharmacy" like marketing approach. This becomes the "feeder system" for sales to our planned compounding production facilities.  There will be a separate subsidiary for its compounding pharmacy, back office production and central fill operations called "TN Compounding, LLC". This will initially be focused on the acquisition of 503a license operations, though management has envisioned a network of these facilities located regionally. It may consider a 503b licensed operation to accommodate the ability to provide both sterile and non-sterile products, including products for stocking inventory at medical offices and hospitals.  Lastly, it expects to acquire unique related technologies, including a growing library of specialized formulations. Many of these formulations will be unique to its operations, and some it expects to either license to others for mass market distribution, or it may produce for stocking inventory at a 503b qualified facility. The entity "TN Technologies, LLC" will hold those intellectual property assets, as well as other novel new approaches it may engage in, directly, or under a license granted from the holders.  Acquisition of Compounding Pharmacy Businesses and Financing  The Company intends to target compounders who have a) strong regulatory compliance history, b) a record of profitable operations, c) a large cash payor component (vs. insurance reimbursement), or an ability to shift from insurance to cash for their revenue, d) operations that represent a geographical "hub" or "spoke" when considered in relation to other compounders, and e) where the combination of operations including embedded retail, and online, facilitates cross selling of a growing line of products.  We have agreements in place, or in negotiation, for the acquisition of three (3) unique business operations. In total, they finished 2016 with over $30 million in annualized revenue, and, when owners' compensation is backed out, and going forward management and costs included, should perform profitably. All have long operating histories, and all are currently profitable. Each acquisition is unique and come with different risks. We always note that past performances are not indicative of future results. Any past success is no guarantee of future profitability.  The "Southeast Group" is a three-unit compounding operation who finished 2016 at over $25 million in revenues, up from $15 million in 2015. They have large library of specialty formulations. They would become the largest "hub" and expand their distribution through the pending retail expansion, which begins with the "Miami Group", with overnight home delivery at pass-through costs.  The "Miami Group" is a small retail pharmacy operation who current does 30% in compounding. They operate inside of a grocery chain, renting space from the Hispanic oriented chain in two (2) of their sixteen (16) units. Each store has over 1,500 unique client experiences, and thus far the current management has done nothing to leverage that built-in traffic. We believe the units where a new footprint can be established with generate around $1 million in annualized sales in the first 12 months after opening, and will reach their maximum at around $2 million in annualized sales. Currently the operations are thinly staffed and do not operate even 40 hours a week. Our plans are to make this the "spoke" and move any significant preparation work to a "hub" site, either at the "Southeast Group" location, or in the "Florida Group" location.  The "Florida Group" is the business upon which the business plan was originally formed in 2016. They have a 15-year operating history, are an all cash business (no insurance reimbursement). They do half their business with veterinary operations, an area we would very much like to grow. The finished 2016 at over $2.7 million, up from $2.5 million, and they have no sales effort, no marketing and no significant presence. They have been size constrained by their facility size, and the lack of sales and marketing, though in early March they will move into a new space, fully compliant with the new USP 800 regulations. They will be the "hub" for most of the Florida operations, and their specialty formations fit the older, Florida market  Recent Developments  As of May 12, 2017, the Company had two (2) members of the Board of Directors, three (3) members of the non-executive Advisory Board, and two (2) members of the management team. We believe that True Nature's management team can remain small in the near term, and will consist of a four person management team with experience in 1) public company accounting and finance, 2) multi-unit supply chain management including retail and wholesale operations, 3) brand marketing aimed at consumer through online and traditional retail channels, and 4) public equity finance. We believe our current team addresses most of these areas, and we anticipate further additions as our size, and funding, can allow.  On January 25, 2017, the Board of Director appointed Christopher Knauf, age 44, as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. From 2014 to present, Mr. Knauf served as a consultant for small to mid-size emerging growth companies, both public and private.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
