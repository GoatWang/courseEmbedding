Portfolio Management


















HomeStrategiesPortfolio ManagementAnalysisProfessionalsMoreHomeStrategiesPortfolio ManagementAnalysisProfessionals☰✕HomeStrategiesPortfolio ManagementAnalysisProfessionalsCustom Portfolio Management Asset Management The most important aspect of an investment plan is allocation of assets. Brookmont offers full asset management services that include investments in four separate asset classes: Equities, Fixed Income, Short-Term Investments, and Real Estate (REITs). Equities  We offer three distinct Equity Strategies (Dividend Equity Strategy, Core Dividend Strategy, and Dividend Growth Strategy) emphasizing common stocks that distribute above-average dividend income and offer potential capital gains. The holdings include small through large-capitalization stocks and may be domestic or foreign domiciled. 
  Fixed Income  Our fixed income portfolio construction consists of investment-grade taxable and tax-free bonds with a primary objective of current income and capital preservation. Our main objective is achieved through in-depth credit work on each fixed income security - focusing on yield while maintaining tight restrictions on credit quality. Our experience in the bond market allows us to utlize active management in finding inefficiencies and taking advantage of them.Risk Management Risk is managed by owning low-correlated securities, investment grade bonds, and a maximum weighting in economic sectors and individual holdings.Year-End Tax Planning Brookmont Capital will work with your CPA to manage year-end tax planning and develop a strategy for the next year. From Trust Accounts to IRA'sBrookmont is experienced in managing a wide variety of portfolios: Investment Management Accounts, IRA's, Tax-Exempt Organizations, Trust Accounts, and Corporations. Quarterly Marketing BrochureBrookmont Second Qtr  2017 (pdf)DownloadCopyright © 2017 Brookmont Capital

Risk ConsiderationsEquity Risk. An investment in a portfolio containing common stocks is subject to certain risks, such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market.Foreign Securities Risk. An investment in securities of foreign issuers should be made with an understanding of the additional risks involved, such as currency fluctuations, political risk, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers.IRA Risk. There may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified plan.Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Risk. An investment in a portfolio containing small-cap and mid-cap companies is subject to additional risks, as the share prices of small-cap companies and certain mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies due to several factors, including limited trading volumes, products, financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.Volatility Risk.

Bloomberg Finance L.P, which we believe to be reliable, but do not take responsibility

The style and capitalization characteristics used to describe the stocks are designed to help you 
understand how they fit into your overall investment plan.  Due to changes in the value of the stocks 
the characteristics may vary over time.  In general, growth stocks have high relative price-to-book 
ratios while value stocks have low relative price-to-book ratios.  In determining market capitalization 
characteristics, we analyze the market capitalizations of the 3,000 largest stocks in the U.S. (excluding 
foreign securities, ADRs, limited partnerships and regulated investment companies) on a monthly basis. 
Companies with market capitalizations among the largest 10% are considered Large-Cap securities, the next

Bill Leonard Joins Brookmont Capital Management

Bill Leonard moves to Brookmont Capital Management. He joined Brookmont Capital, a Dallas-based, locally owned investment advisory firm. Founded in September 2007, by Robert Bugg and Neal Scott, Brookmont Capital specializes in customized equity and active fixed income management. Leonard and Bugg have been working together as a team for over 11 years, providing comprehensive wealth management services to individuals, retirees, business owners, corporate executives and professionals.







I am delighted to have joined Brookmont


Past News ReleasesRSS



Dallas, TX (PRWEB)
June 17, 2008
 Bill Leonard is excited to join Brookmont Capital Management (http://www.brookmontcapital.com). Robert (Bobby) Bugg and Neal Scott built Brookmont Capital based on the foundation that the relationship between a client and his/her advisor is paramount. Leonard has dedicated his career to superior client service. Bugg said, "Bill's arrival rounds out our client service team.  His dedication to superior client service made him my first and only choice for this role."  
"I am delighted to have joined Brookmont," comments Leonard. "With 24 years of industry experience, I know at the end of my career, I will be measured by the number of clients I've served, not by the amount of products I've sold.  Helping others really gives me enthusiasm and satisfaction.  I have to say that hearing John Templeton years ago changed my life.  At an investment seminar, his concluding remarks were: "You can only take with you that which you have given away."
"I cannot describe the sea-change in attitude this perspective gave me then and still gives me today, Leonard says. "In a world seeming to be full of greed and self-gratification, to have the attitude of 'service above self' builds relationships – not just transactions.  Think of the possibilities if we simply chose to serve someone every day – to find just one person and do something good for him or her – to serve.  How would we change the world?"
Leonard holds the dual designations of Certified Trust & Financial Advisor (CTFA) with honors and Certified IRA Specialist (CISP) from the American Bankers' Association, Institute of Certified Bankers in Washington D.C. 
Leonard and Bugg have spent the last 12 and 11 years, respectively, at Comerica Trust and Investment Management. Their years at Comerica enabled them to work closely as a team providing clients an unparalleled level of service. Says Leonard, "Bobby's investment record speaks for itself.  The additional service we can provide individuals with wealth and retirement planning benefits our clients.  The experience we have from our years in trust departments gives us unique insights to assist fiduciaries – whether they are individuals or bank trust departments.  We understand 'QTIP' is not just a way to clean your ears!"
Located at 2100 McKinney on the 9th floor of the Texas Capital Bank Building, Brookmont overlooks The Crescent; Brookmont is conveniently located in Uptown Dallas.
