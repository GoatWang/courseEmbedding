	of incorporation to change the name of the Company from Apolo Gold Inc. to Apolo Gold & Energy Inc.




	 




	After
	incorporation in 1997 the Company focused on precious metals opportunities in Latin and South America. Shortly thereafter the
	Company formed a subsidiary, Compania Minera Apologold, C.A. a corporation, and on May 18, 1999 the Venezuela subsidiary entered
	into an agreement with Empresa Proyectos Mineros Goldma, C.A. in Caracas Venezuela, to acquire the diamond and gold mining concession
	in Southern Venezuela known as Codsa 13, located in the Gran Sabana Autonomous Municipality, State of Bolivar, Venezuela. This
	project was subsequently cancelled in August 2001 because of poor testing results. The subsidiary company in Venezuela has been
	dormant since 2001 and will not be reactivated.




	 




	On
	April 16, 2002, the Company executed an agreement with Pt. Metro Astatama, of Jakarta, Indonesia, for the mining rights to a property
	known as Nepal Umbar Picung (“NUP”), which is located west of Bandar Lampung, on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.
	NUP has a KP, Number KW. 098PP325, which is a mineral tenement license for both Exploration and Exploitation. All KP’s must
	be held by an Indonesian entity.




	 




	The
	“NUP” is 733.9 hectares in size and Apolo had an 80% interest. These claims are owned privately by citizens of Indonesia
	and are not crown granted claims. Apolo was entitled to recover all of its development costs on the “NUP” including
	property payments before the partner with 20% can participate.




	 




	The
	total purchase price for “NUP” was $375,000, of which payments amounting to $250,000 had been made. After various
	exploration programs including different drilling programs failed to yield sufficient positive results, the Company discussed
	various options with the property owner and decided to terminate its agreement with the NUP property and return all exploration
	rights to the property owners.




	 




	On
	December 11, 2013, the Company acquired 70% interest in three gold exploration claims located in China’s Xinjiang Province
	from Yinfu Gold Corp. (“Yinfu”). The Company issued six million shares of restricted common stocks for the claims.




	 




	On
	December 23, 2013, the Company acquired 24% equity interest in Jiangxi Everenergy New Material Co., Ltd. (“Everenergy”).
	The consideration was settled by the issuance of eight-million restricted common stocks at a deemed price of $0.375 per share,
	plus $1-million in cash. Additionally, on February 19, 2014, the Company acquired an additional 29% equity interest in Everenergy.
	The consideration was settled with the issuance of 11-million restricted common stock at a deemed price of $0.45 per share.




	 




	On
	September 17, 2014, the Company cancelled both transactions with Everenergy and had requested return of the $1-million payment
	and all the shares. The 11-million shares issued were effectively cancelled on October 21, 2014. The remaining 8-million shares
	issued are in the process of cancellation and the $1 million paid for the acquisition was written off as investment loss.




	 




	On
	January 19, 2015, the Company and Yinfu reached a mutual agreement to terminate the acquisition of the 70% interest in the three
	gold exploration claims in the PRC. On February 3, 2015, all six million shares of restricted common stock had been returned by
	the wholly owned subsidiary of Yinfu and cancelled by the Company.

	and regulations and will abide by them.





	 








	ITEM
	1A. Risk Factors





	 





	1.	The
	Company has no record of earnings. It is also subject to all the risks inherent in a developing business enterprise including
	lack of cash flow, and no assurance of recovery of precious metals.




	 




	2.	The
	Company’s success and possible growth will depend on its ability to develop or acquire new business operations. It continues
	to explore opportunities but has yet to secure an opportunity that is acceptable.




	 




	3.	Liquidity
	and need for additional financing is a concern for the Company. At the present time, the Company does not have sufficient cash
	to finance its operations. The Company is dependent on the ability of its management team to obtain the necessary working capital
	to operate successfully. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital as required or if the
	capital is available, to obtain it on terms favorable to the Company. The Company may suffer from a lack of liquidity in the future
	that could impair its production efforts and adversely affect its results of operations.




	 




	4.	Competition
	is more in the area of ability to sell at world prices that the Company cannot control, and the Company competes for access to
	the world markets with its products.




	 




	5.	The
	Company is wholly dependent at the present upon the personal efforts and abilities of its Officers and Directors, who exercise
	control over the day-to-day affairs of the Company.




	 




	6.	There
	are currently 30,072,118 common shares outstanding at September 28, 2016 out of a total authorized capital of 300,000,000 shares.
	This is after giving effect of the cancellation issuance of 11,000,000 common shares for the acquisition of 29% interest in Everenergy;
	cancellation issuance of 6,000,000 common shares for the three mineral properties; issuance of 1,040,000 common shares as debt
	settlement; issuance of 6,400,000 common shares as consulting services provided. The Company continues to pursue the return of
	8,000,000 shares from the cancelled acquisition of the additional 24% interest in Everenergy. The Board of Directors has the power
	to issue such shares, subject to Shareholder approval, in some instances.

	7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations/Plan of Operation General Overview





	 




	Apolo
	Gold & Energy Inc. (“Company”) was incorporated in March 1997 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Its objective
	was to pursue mineral properties in South America, Central America, North America and Asia. The Company incorporated a subsidiary
	- Compania Minera Apologold, C.A in Venezuela to develop a gold/diamond mining concession in Southeastern Venezuela. Project was
	terminated in August 2001, due to poor testing results and the property abandoned. This subsidiary company has been inactive since
	2001 and will not be reactivated.




	 




	On
	April 16, 2002, the Company announced the acquisition of the mining rights to a property known as the Napal Gold Property, (“NUP”).
	This property is located 48 km south-west of Bandar Lampung, Sumatra, Indonesia. The property consisted of 733.9 hectares and
	possessed a Production Permit (a KP) # KW. 098PP325.




	 




	The
	terms of the Napal Gold Property called for a total payment of $375,000 US over a six-year period of which a total of $250,000
	have been made to date. Company paid $250,000 over the past 5 years and subsequent to the year ending June 30, 2008 the Company
	terminated its agreement on the NUP property and returned all exploration rights to the owner.




	 




	On
	December 11, 2013, the Company acquired 70% interest in three gold exploration claims located in China’s Xinjiang Province
	from Yinfu Gold Corp. (“Yinfu”). The Company issued 6,000,000 shares of restricted common stock for the claims at
	$0.20 per share for the consideration of $1,200,000. On January 19, 2015, the Company and Yinfu reached a mutual agreement to
	terminate the acquisition at the current market value of $0.10 per share and therefore an investment loss of $600,000 was resulted.
	On February 3, 2015, all 6,000,000 shares of restricted common stock were returned and effectively cancelled.




	 




	On
	December 23, 2013, the Company acquired 24% interest in Jiangxi Everenergy New Material Co., Ltd. (“Everenergy”) for
	a consideration of $4,000,000. The consideration was settled with the issuance of 8,000,000 shares of restricted common stock
	at a deemed price of $0.375 per share, plus $1,000,000 in cash.




	 




	On
	February 19, 2014, the Company acquired an additional 29% interest in Everenergy for a consideration of $4,950,000. The consideration
	was settled with the issuance of 11,000,000 shares of restricted common stock at a deemed price of $0.45 per share.




	 




	On
	September 17, 2014, the Company cancelled both transactions with Everenergy at the current market value of $0.12 per share and
	requested the return of $1,000,000 cash payment. The 11,000,000 shares were effectively cancelled on October 21, 2014 and the
	remaining 8,000,000 shares are to be cancelled. For the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company could not recover the $1,000,000
	cash payment and therefore a total investment loss of $6,670,000 was resulted.




	 




	On
	February 13, 2015, the Company disposed its 100% equity interest in Apolo Gold Direct Limited (formerly known as Apolo Gold &
	Energy Asia Limited) to (i) Mr. Tommy Tsap Wai Ping, who acquired 50% equity interest. Mr. Tsap Wai Ping became the Chief Executive
	Officer (“CEO”) and director of the Company on December 1, 2015. (ii) Mr. Kelvin Chak Wai Man, the former president,
	CEO and director of the Company and a relative of the current CEO of the Company, acquired 40% equity interest, and (iii) China

	and strategic consulting services of $600,000 in a service period of twelve months commencing from June 2015. For the years ended
	June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company amortized $550,000 and $50,000, respectively to the operations using the straight-line method.

	Results
	of Operations - Year ended June 30, 2016 compared to year ended June 30, 2015






	 






	REVENUES:

	The Company had no revenues in the past fiscal years.





	 






	EXPENSES:






	 





	During
	the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the Company had no exploration costs. Total expenses for the year ended
	June 30, 2016 amounted to $614,505 compared to $7,549,476 for the year ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of $6,934,971. The decrease
	is mainly attributable to the investment loss of $7,270,000 recorded in fiscal year 2015, which resulted from the termination
	of the acquisition of (i) 70% interest in gold exploration claims in Mainland China and (ii) an aggregate 53% equity interest
	in Jiangxi Everenergy New Material Co., Ltd.




	 




	Consulting
	and professional fees for the year ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $597,203 compared to $237,597 for the year ended June 30, 2015,
	an increase of $359,606. Among the consulting and professional fees, approximately $559,333 and $122,300 were settled by stock
	based compensation for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.




	 




	There
	were no additional or extraordinary expenses incurred in the current year ending June 30, 2016 as the Company focused its efforts
	in seeking out a resource project that would be beneficial to shareholders.




	 




	The
	Company continues to carefully control its expenses, and intends to seek additional financing both for potential business opportunities
	it may develop. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its attempts to raise additional capital.




	 




	The
	Company has no employees in its head office at the present time other than its Officers and Directors, and engages personnel through
	consulting agreements where necessary as well as outside attorneys, accountants and technical consultants.

	and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2016 was $8,993 compared to $14,403 in 2015 and the Company recognizes it may not have sufficient

	ended in 2015. The cash used in operating activities are mainly attributed from the net loss of $614,505 for the year ended June
	30, 2016 and offset by non-cash stock based compensation of $559,333.

	financing. The Company recognizes that it is dependent on the ability of its management team to obtain the necessary working capital
	required.

	REPORT
	OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING





	 





	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company.
	Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
	reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal
	control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions;
	providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing
	reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and
	providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material
	effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
	control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements
	would be prevented or detected.




	 




	In
	connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, Management on Internal Control
	over Financial Reporting is under the supervision of the principal executive officer who is the chief executive officer of the
	Company. Under his direction, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as required
	by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of June 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer concluded that Disclosures
	Controls and Procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016. Due to limited financial resources available, there is a lack
	of segregation of duties in financial reporting although the Principal Executive Officer, who also serves as Principal Financial
	Officer, is an experienced financial executive and professional with professional accreditation.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 




	To
	the Board of Directors and Stockholders,




	Wincash
	Apolo Gold & Energy, Inc.




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Wincash Apolo Gold & Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) as of June 30,
	2016 and 2015 and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the
	years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
	is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America).
	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
	are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
	control over financial reporting. Our audits include consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
	designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
	effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
	also includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
	the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statements
	presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
	Company as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred substantial losses, which raises substantial doubt about its ability
	to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to their planned financing and other matters are also described
	in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	WINCASH APOLO GOLD & ENERGY, INC.





	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015




	(Currency expressed in United States Dollars
	(“US$”), except for number of shares)




	 




	1. 	ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF
	BUSINESS




	 



	Wincash Apolo Gold & Energy, Inc. (“the
	Company”) was incorporated in March of 1997 under the laws of the State of Nevada primarily for the purpose of acquiring
	and developing mineral properties.


	 


	On September 17, 2014, the Company terminated
	the Asset Sale & Purchase Agreements with Mr. Tang and Mr. Hu for the acquisition of 24% and 29% equity interest and assets
	in Everenergy, respectively due to neither Mr. Tang, Mr. Hu or Everenergy had complied various terms and conditions of the Asset
	Sale & Purchase Agreement. On the same day, the Board of Directors approved the cancellation of the total 19,000,000 shares
	of restricted common stock at the current market value of $0.12 per share. On October 21, 2014, 11,000,000 shares were returned
	and effectively cancelled and the Company continues to pursue the return and cancellation of the remaining 8,000,000 shares. For
	the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company could not recover the $1,000,000 cash payment and a total investment loss of $6,670,000
	was resulted.


	 


	On February 13, 2015, the Company disposed
	its 100% equity interest in Apolo Gold Direct Limited (formerly known as Apolo Gold & Energy Asia Limited) to Mr. Tommy Tsap,
	the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and director of the Company, Mr. Tsap Wai Ping, the brother of the CEO and China
	Yi Gao Gold Trader Co., Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, for a consideration of $100. For the year ended June, 30,
	2015, there was no gain or loss recognized on the disposal of a subsidiary.


	 


	On June 18, 2015, the Company filed an Amendment
	to its Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change its name from Apolo Gold & Energy, Inc. to Wincash
	Apolo Gold & Energy, Inc.


	 


	The Company will continue to anticipate potential
	mineral property exploration and other energy related investments. As of June 30, 2016, the Company does not hold any mineral
	property exploration claims.


	 


	2.	GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
	discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.


	 


	As of June 30, 2016, the Company suffered
	the accumulated deficits of $16,050,826 from prior years and suffered from a working capital deficit of $75,460. The continuation
	of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continuing financial support from its stockholders or external financing.
	Management believes the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet with the Company’s obligations as
	they become due. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient funds to meet its obligations.


	 


	These factors raise substantial doubt about
	the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
	the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
	that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

	WINCASH APOLO GOLD
	& ENERGY, INC.



	NOTES TO FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS




	FOR THE YEARS ENDED
	JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015




	(Currency expressed
	in United States Dollars (“US$”), except for number of shares)



	 


	3.	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES



	 




	Basis of presentation



	 


	The accompanying financial statements are
	prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).


	 



	Use of estimates



	 


	Management uses estimates and assumptions
	in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts
	of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, and the reported revenue
	and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.


	 



	Cash and cash equivalents



	 


	Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost
	and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments
	with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.


	 



	Stock-based compensation



	 


	The Company adopts FASB Accounting Standards
	Codification Topic 718,

	Compensation – Stock Compensation

	(“ASC Topic 718”) using the fair value method.
	Under ASC Topic 718, the stock-based compensation is measured using the Black-Scholes Option-Pricing model on the date of grant
	under the modified prospective method. The fair value of stock-based compensation that are expected to vest are recognized using
	the straight-line method over the requisite service period.


	 



	Income taxes



	 


	Income taxes are determined in accordance
	with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC Topic 740”). Under this method, deferred tax
	assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
	carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
	using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected
	to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
	in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for
	how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or
	expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when
	it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially
	and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon
	ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.


	 



	Net loss per share



	 


	The Company calculates net loss per share
	in accordance with ASC Topic 260,

	“Earnings per Share.”

	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net
	loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed similar
	to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would
	have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.

	WINCASH APOLO GOLD & ENERGY, INC.



	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015




	(Currency expressed in United States Dollars
	(“US$”), except for number of shares)



	 



	Related parties



	 


	Parties, which can be a corporation or individual,
	are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant
	influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they
	are subject to common control or common significant influence.


	 



	Fair value of financial instruments



	 


	The carrying value of the Company’s
	financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, prepayments, other payables and accrued liabilities, and amount due to a director
	approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.


	 


	The Company also follows the guidance of the
	ASC Topic 820-10, “

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	” (“ASC 820-10”), with respect to financial
	assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
	the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:


	 




	 



	Level 1: Observable
	inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;





	 


	 




	 



	Level 2: Inputs,
	other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and





	 


	 




	 



	Level 3: Unobservable
	inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.





	 


	Fair value estimates are made at a specific
	point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and
	involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions
	could significantly affect the estimates.


	 



	Foreign currency translation



	 


	Transactions denominated in currencies other
	than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
	transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into
	the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are
	recorded in the statement of operations.


	 


	The reporting currency of the Company is United
	States Dollars (“US$”) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$.


	 



	Recent accounting pronouncements



	 


	FASB issues various Accounting Standards Updates
	relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions. On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10,Development Stage Entities (Topic 915) - Elimination of Certain Financial
	Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation, which eliminates
	the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) entirely from current accounting guidance. The Company has elected adoption of
	this standard, which eliminates the designation of DSEs and the requirement to disclose results of operations and cash flows since
	inception.


	 


	The Company has reviewed all recently issued,
	but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected
	to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

	(Currency expressed in United States Dollars
	(“US$”), except for number of shares)



	 


	4.	AMOUNT DUE TO A DIRECTOR


	 


	As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the director
	of the Company has advanced $44,300 and $10,000, respectively for the payment of administrative expenses. The amount is unsecured,
	bears no interest and is payable upon demand. Imputed interest is considered insignificant.


	 


	5.	COMMON STOCK



	 



	On September 17, 2014, the Board of Directors
	approved the cancellation of the total 19,000,000 shares of restricted common stocks issued for the acquisition of equity interest
	in Everenergy at a current market value of $0.12 per share. The 11,000,000 shares issued to Mr. Hu were effectively cancelled

	The Company is registered in the State of
	Nevada and is subject to the tax laws of the United States of America. As of June 30, 2016, the operations in the United States
	of America incurred $16,050,826 of cumulative net operating losses which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income.
	The net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in the year 2017 through 2035, if unutilized. The Company has provided for
	a full valuation allowance of $4,012,706 against the deferred tax assets on the expected future tax benefits from the net operating
	loss carryforwards as the management believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized in the future.


	 


	Management believes that it is more likely
	than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable in the future. Accordingly, the Company provided for a full
	valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets of $4,012,706 as of June 30, 2016. During the year ended June 30, 2016, the
	valuation allowance increased by $153,626, primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards from the various tax regime.

	balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued, the Company has evaluated all events or transactions that occurred
	after June 30, 2016 up through the date the Company issued the audited financial statements. During the period, there was no subsequent
	events that required recognition or disclosure.

	ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



	 




	Disclosure Controls and
	Procedures



	 


	We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
	of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of June 30, 2016 (the
	“Evaluation Date”). This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
	concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the Evaluation Date as a result of the material
	weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed below.


	 


	Disclosure controls and procedures are those
	controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
	under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules
	and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
	our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	Notwithstanding the assessment that our internal
	control over financial reporting was not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report, we believe
	that our financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 fairly present our
	financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in all material respects.


	 



	Management’s Annual
	Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing
	and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
	the Exchange Act, for the Company.


	 


	Internal control over financial reporting
	includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
	and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
	as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
	our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
	could have a material effect on the financial statements.


	 


	Management recognizes that there are inherent
	limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective internal control can provide
	only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements.
	In addition, effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions
	or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures.


	 






	 



	20



	 






	 



	 


	A material weakness is a significant deficiency,
	or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement
	of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.


	 


	Under the supervision and with the participation
	of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
	control over financial reporting, as of the Evaluation Date, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its evaluation under this framework,
	management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the Evaluation Date.


	 


	Management assessed the effectiveness of the
	Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of Evaluation Date and identified the following material weaknesses:



	 




	Inadequate Segregation
	of Duties

	: We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures.


	 



	Insufficient Written Policies & Procedures:

	We have insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting.


	 



	Inadequate Financial Statement
	Closing Process:

	We have an inadequate financial statement closing process.


	 



	Lack of Audit Committee:

	The lack of
	a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company’s Board of Directors, resulting
	in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures.


	 


	Management is committed to improving its internal
	controls and will (1) continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist the Company with
	accounting and finance responsibilities, (2) increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which
	will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel and (3) prepare and implement sufficient
	written policies and checklists for financial reporting and closing processes and (4) may consider appointing outside directors
	and audit committee members in the future.


	 


	Management, including our Chief Executive
	Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public
	accounting firm. Due to the nature of this material weakness, there is a more than remote likelihood that misstatements which
	could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected.


	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation
	report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report
	was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us
	to provide only management’s report in this annual report.


	 



	Changes in internal control
	over financial reporting



	 


	There were no changes in our internal control
	over financial reporting that occurred during the last quarter ended June 30, 2015 that have materially affected, or that are
	reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


	 



	Limitations on the effectiveness
	of controls and procedures



	 


	Our management, including our Chief Executive
	Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that the our controls and procedures will prevent all potential errors
	or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
	the objectives of the control system are met.

	Tsap Wai Ping (Tommy Tsap),
	President, CEO, Secretary, Director



	 


	Effective December
	1, 2015, Mr. Tommy Tsap was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Edward Low has been appointed Chief Financial
	Officer of the Corporation. They replace Mr. Robert Dinning who submitted his resignation as Director, President and CEO, CFO,

	Mr. Low, based in
	Vancouver, Canada, has provided accounting services to public companies for the past 18 years. Currently, Mr. Low serves as CFO
	for a number of publicly traded companies listed in Canada and the United States.


	 


	Committees: Meetings
	of the Board



	 



	The Company does not have a separate Compensation
	Committee, Audit Committee or Nominating Committee. These functions are done by the Board of Directors meeting as a whole. The
	Company’s Board of Directors held both in person meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30,2016 and meetings by were
	conducted by telephone. All corporate actions by the Board of Directors were either consented to in writing by all Directors or
	were agreed to unanimously at a meeting where proper notice had been given and a quorum was present.


	 


	Audit Committee



	 



	The board of directors has not established
	an audit committee. The functions of the audit committee are currently performed by the entire board of directors. The Company
	is under no legal obligation to establish an audit committee and has elected not to do so at this time so as to avoid the time
	and expense of identifying independent directors willing to serve on the audit committee. The Company may establish an audit committee
	in the future if the board determines it to be advisable or we are otherwise required to do so by applicable law, rule or regulation.


	 






	 



	23



	 






	 



	 


	As the board of directors does not have an
	audit committee, it therefore has no “audit committee financial expert” within the meaning of Item 401(e) of Regulation
	S-B. except its chief financial officer. In general, an “audit committee financial expert” is an individual member
	of the audit committee who:


	 




	●



	understands
	generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements,





	 


	 




	●



	is
	able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves,





	 


	 




	●



	has
	experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the breadth and complexity to our
	financial statements,





	 


	 




	●



	understands
	internal controls over financial reporting, and





	 


	 




	●



	understands
	audit committee functions.





	 


	Board of Directors Independence



	 



	One of the Company’s directors is “independent”
	within the meaning of definitions established by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any self-regulatory organization. This
	director is Tsap Wai, Ping (Tommy Tsap). The Company is not currently subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that all
	or any portion of its board of directors include “independent” directors.


	 


	Director Nominees



	 



	The Company does not have a nominating committee.
	The board of directors, sitting as a board, selects those individuals to stand for election as members of our board. Since the
	board of directors does not include a majority of independent directors, the decision of the board as to director nominees is
	made by persons who have an interest in the outcome of the determination. The board will consider candidates for directors proposed
	by security holders, although no formal procedures for submitting candidates have been adopted. Until otherwise determined, not
	less than 90 days prior to the next annual board of directors’ meeting at which the slate of board nominees is adopted,
	the board accepts written submissions that include the name, address and telephone number of the proposed nominee, along with
	a brief statement of the candidate’s qualifications to serve as a director and a statement of why the shareholder submitting
	the name of the proposed nominee believes that the nomination would be in the best interests of shareholders. If the proposed
	nominee is not the security holder submitting the name of the candidate, a letter from the candidate agreeing to the submission
	of his or her name for consideration should be provided at the time of submission. The letter should be accompanied by a resume
	supporting the nominee’s qualifications to serve on the board of directors, as well as a list of references.


	 


	The board identifies director nominees through
	a combination of referrals, including by management, existing board members and security holders, where warranted. Once a candidate
	has been identified the board reviews the individual’s experience and background, and may discuss the proposed nominee with
	the source of the recommendation. If the board believes it to be appropriate, board members may meet with the proposed nominee
	before making a final determination whether to include the proposed nominee as a member of management’s slate of director
	nominees submitted for shareholders for election to the board.


	 


	Among the factors that the board considers
	when evaluating proposed nominees are their experience in the information technology industry, knowledge of and experience with
	and knowledge of and experience in business matters, finance, capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. The board may request
	additional information from the candidate prior to reaching a determination. The board is under no obligation to formally respond
	to all recommendations, although as a matter of practice, it will endeavor to do so.

	Security Holder Communications with our
	Board of Directors



	 



	The Company provides an informal process for
	security holders to send communications to our board of directors. Security holders who wish to contact the board of directors
	or any of its members may do so by writing to Wincash Apolo Gold & Energy Inc., at 20/F, EIB Centre, 40-44 Bonham Strand,

	Correspondence directed to an individual board
	member is referred, unopened, to that member. Correspondence not directed to a particular board member is referred, unopened,
	to the President and CEO.


	 


	Code of Ethics



	 



	Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
	Securities and Exchange Commission’s related rules, the Company is required to disclose whether it has adopted a code of
	ethics that applies to the Company’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer
	or controller or persons performing similar functions. The Company has adopted a code of ethics that applies to its chief executive
	officer, chief financial officer and other officers, legal counsel and to any person performing similar functions. The Company
	has made the code of ethics available and intends to provide disclosure of any amendments or waivers of the code within five business
	days after an amendment or waiver on the Company’s website wwww.apologold.com.


	 


	Compliance with Section 16(a) of Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934



	 



	During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016
	our Directors and Officers have complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements.


	 


	Family Relationships

	Compensation Discussion and Analysis



	 



	The following Compensation Discussion and
	Analysis (CD&A) provides information on the compensation programs established for our “Named Executive Officers”
	during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. All information provided herein should be read in conjunction with the tables provided
	below.


	 


	Our Board of Directors is responsible for
	establishing, implementing and monitoring the policies governing compensation for our executives. Currently our Board does not
	have a compensation committee. Our officers are members of our Board of Directors and are able to vote on matters of compensation.
	We are not currently under any legal obligation to establish a compensation committee and have elected not to do so at this time.
	In the future, we may establish a compensation committee if the Board determines it to be advisable or we are otherwise required
	to do so by applicable law, rule or regulation. During the year ended June 30, 2016 our Board did not employ any outside consultants
	to assist in carrying out its responsibilities with respect to executive compensation, although we have access to general executive
	compensation information regarding both local and national industry compensation practices. In future periods we may participate
	in regional and national surveys that benchmark executive compensation by peer group factors such as company size, annual revenues,
	market capitalization and geographical location.


	 


	The executive employment market in general
	is very competitive due to the number of companies with whom we compete to attract and retain executive and other staff with the
	requisite skills and experience to carry out our strategy and to maintain compliance with multiple Federal and State regulatory
	agencies. Many of these companies have significantly greater economic resources than our own. Our Board has recognized that our
	compensation packages must be able to attract and retain highly talented individuals that are committed to our goals and objectives,
	without at this time paying cash salaries that are competitive with some of our peers with greater economic resources. Our compensation
	structure is weighted towards equity compensation in the form of options to acquire common stock, which the Board believes motivates
	and encourages executives to pursue strategic opportunities while managing the risks involved in our current business stage, and
	aligns compensation incentives with value creation for our shareholders.

	Components of Our Executive Compensation
	Program



	 



	Our executive compensation program incorporates
	components we believe are necessary in order for the Company to provide a competitive compensation package relative to our peers
	and to provide an appropriate mix between short-term and long-term cash and non-cash compensation. Elements of our executive compensation
	are listed below:


	  




	 



	●




	Base
	Salary





	 


	 


	 




	 


	●



	Stock
	Awards





	 


	 


	 




	 


	●



	Other
	benefits available to all employees





	 


	 


	 




	 


	●



	Items
	specific to our President and Chief Executive Officer per an employment agreement





	 


	Base Salary: At present we do not have a
	salary structure for employees and executives is based on skill set, knowledge and responsibilities. Base salaries may be
	established as necessary. During the year ended June 30, 2016 none of our Named Executive Officers received a salary
	increase.


	 


	Stock Awards: A portion of compensation paid
	to our executives is equity based. We believe equity compensation helps align the interests of our executives with the interests
	of our shareholders. In that regard, our executives’ compensation is subject to downside risk in the event that our common
	stock price decreases. In addition, we believe stock awards provide incentives to aid in the retention of key executives.


	 


	Other Benefits: Our Executive Officers and
	employees receive no other benefits.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-0.01      Market Cap $2.03 M     Shares Outstanding 23.86 M     Public Float 21.46 M     Yield APLL has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
