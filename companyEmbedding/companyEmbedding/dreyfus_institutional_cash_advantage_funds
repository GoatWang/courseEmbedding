Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of any mutual fund carefully before investing. Download a money market fund prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about a fund. Read it carefully before investing.The net asset value (NAV) of the fund’s shares will “float,” meaning the NAV or share price of the fund will fluctuate with changes in the values of the fund’s portfolio securities. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them.The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.Fund Share Price calculations reflect the use of amortized cost to the extent permitted by Rule 2a-7. Market value NAV’s disclosed herein do not reflect the use of amortized cost to value any portfolio holdings, as required by Rule 2a-7.Yield and investment return fluctuate and past performance is no guarantee of future results. As a measure of current income, 7-day yield most closely reflects the fund's current income generating ability. 30-day yield is based upon dividends per share from net investment income during the past 30 days, divided by the period ended maximum offering price per share and annualized. Daily and 30-day yield quotations may reflect current expense absorptions, without which performance would have been lower.While dividends are declared daily, they are paid monthly (if any).Market Value NAV: Calculated based on available market quotations (except overnight securities which are valued at amortized cost) related to the Fund’s securities at the close of business on the date stated. It is calculated to the nearest hundredth of a cent or (or $0.0001).WAM: A measure of the average maturity of all of the underlying money market instruments in the fund, weighted to reflect the relative percentage ownership of each instrument, and taking into account applicable “maturity shortening” provisions provided by the Rule. Generally, for money market funds, WAM can be used primarily as a measure of relative sensitivity to interest rate changes.WAL: WAL is the WAM of the money market fund calculated without reference to the “maturity shortening” provisions of Rule 2a-7 permitted for purposes of calculating WAM. Because WAL does not reflect the rule’s “maturity shortening” provisions, WAL will generally be higher than WAM.Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) and Weighted Average Life to Maturity (WAL) statistics displayed before approximately 7:30 p.m. ET reflect calculations made prior to the afternoon time of day for pricing fund shares; WAM and WAL statistics displayed after 7:30 p.m. ET reflect updated calculations.Any order in proper form placed with Dreyfus by the Fund’s trading deadline and for which Federal Funds are received by 6:00 PM ET will be effective on that date. Investors will earn the dividend declared on that day.The information on this Web site is not an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security, nor shall any such security be offered or sold to any person in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, purchase, or sale may not lawfully be made.
