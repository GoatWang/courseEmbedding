History[edit]




Kirby Sentria Chrome Edition


The first Kirby vacuums were designed by James B. Kirby (1885–1971) for George Scott and Carl Fetzer after World War I, although the Kirby name was not used on a vacuum cleaner until the 1930s.[2] James Kirby invented the "vacuette" circa 1920, and their primary competitors were The Hoover Company and The Eureka Company which both began operations in 1909, and Bissell who originally built carpet sweepers beginning in 1876.[3]
The Vacuette Electric, introduced in 1925 with its removable floor nozzle and handle, became the forerunner of today's multi-attachment Kirby vacuum models. In 1935, the company introduced the Kirby Model C, the first product to carry Jim Kirby's name.[4] The Vacuette was also briefly offered without an electric motor, utilizing a spring-loaded worm gear driven by pulling the vacuum cleaner backwards, then when pushing the machine forward, the worm gear would power a turbine that provided the suction needed. It was designed for rural areas that didn't have electricity, and was very similar to the carpet sweeper.
While competitors have changed the orientation of the motor, their products appearance, materials used in construction and other features over the years, Kirby has remained with the original machines design, materials used and functionality with enhancements added to aide in its operation and durability. The company changes the appearance with revised color schemes and introduces new model names while keeping the core technology intact.[5]
In 1970, input from Kirby distributors, dealers, management and customers guided Kirby engineers in developing the Kirby Classic. This ushered in the second generation models, and was an instant success, with soaring sales, forcing the company to expand its manufacturing facilities outside of Cleveland for the first time. In 1972, Kirby West began operations in Andrews, Texas at 1345 NW 101 Street. The facility doubled the company's manufacturing capabilities.[4] The company did maintain a presence in Canada at 1009 Burns Street East in Whitby which is no longer staffed.
Berkshire Hathaway bought Kirby parent Scott Fetzer in 1986 for $315 million.[3] Two years prior, Ivan Boesky had offered to buy Scott Fetzer for $60 a share, or $420 million.[6] Warren Buffett has singled out Scott Fetzer to Berkshire's shareholders as the "prototype" for the "kind of company — and acquisition — he was interested in."[7] According to Berkshire managers, "absolutely no changes were made to the existing Scott Fetzer business or management, and the entire business (and its jet) was preserved."[8]
As of 2003, Kirby is the largest source of revenue and profit for Scott Fetzer, with approximately 500,000 sales per year, about a third of which are outside the United States.[9] In 2003, Scott Fetzer sold the vacuums to about 835 factory distributors, who in turn sell the vacuums door-to-door.[9] As an incentive to new customers, Kirby offers the Service Center Vacuum Rebuild Program for original owners who have been registered with the company. As long as the customer owns the machine as the registered owner, if the cleaner needs repair, they can send it back to the Rebuild Department and have it restored to “like new” condition. The company will completely disassemble it, repair or replace any worn Kirby parts, and sandblast, polish and buff metal parts back to a shiny “new” appearance. Internal components are also thoroughly inspected and repaired with Kirby replacement parts so that it will perform as originally designed.[10]
Kirby unit models[edit]




A Kirby G5 upright vacuum cleaner


The Kirby Company generally produces only one model at a time. Kirby's vacuums made until 1919 were made by Frantz Premier. Those made from 1919 to 1934 are branded and made by The Scott & Fetzer Company. After 1934 all machines have been made by Scott & Fetzer, though branded as Kirby.
From 1935 through the 1980s, continuous improvements and refinements were made to the Kirby home care system. One of the popular selling points is that it can be easily configured into a canister vacuum, hand portable vacuum, air pump, floor polisher, and more. It can also be converted into a shampoo system for carpets and a sweeping, dusting, and mopping system for bare floors. [11][4] The characteristic chrome appearance is due to the bulk of the machine is assembled from aluminum, a tradition going back to the very early days of manufacture.
Beginning in the 1990s, the Generation series ushered in a new platform for the cleaner. The addition of TechDrive variable power assist eliminated 90% of the effort required to move the unit back and forth.[4] The current model, the Avalir, continues the tradition that converts the vacuum into several different units beginning with the Model 508 in 1948. With most vacuum cleaner models, the rubber drive belt that powers the brush bar, an integral component with most modern machines, remains in place and is only examined when it breaks. Vacuum attachments are available on other machines but don't require the drive belt to be disconnected. Kirby attachments are connected to the power unit, and disconnecting the drive belt is usually involved in the process that add to its flexibility.[5]
One of the key procedures for using a Kirby Vacuum is the correct way to adjust the carpet nozzle for the best possible results. Starting with the 1939 Model 2C to the most current machine, the instruction manual states that the carpet nozzle should be gradually lowered into position with the Toe-Touch latch[5], incrementally adjusting the rug nozzle until the rotating vibrating brush establishes contact, and the sound of the motor changes indicating suction has been achieved. With the introduction of the Model 505, the power switch was relocated from the top of the handle to the motor itself, so the handle could be removed and the machine converted to a portable unit with a shoulder strap so that cleaning in difficult areas could be performed, and the machine converted into a canister-type cleaner with a long hose attached to the front for dusting tasks.
Starting with the Model 505, adjusting the carpet nozzle employed what Kirby called "Triple Cushioned Vibration Rug Cleaning Action".[5] This involved briefly lifting the carpet up off the floor with the significant suction created by the machine, thereby cushioning the area to be cleaned off of the floor, while the rotating vibrating brush separated the carpet fibers, thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating the carpet fibers. Earlier methods instructed that the carpet nozzle must maintain contact with the surface of the carpet, utilizing the suction, while later instruction manuals recommended the nozzle be slightly above with only the brush establishing contact and improving airflow around the surface being cleaned. For delicate surfaces, the drive belt that spins the brush can be detached so that only suction is used. When the Heritage Model was introduced in 1982, the Brush Performance Indicator Light was installed in the top of the carpet nozzle, which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush. A small LED bulb would light up when the brush was spinning; if the light appeared to blink or wasn't illuminated, it meant the brush wasn't rotating at the desired speed, and that the nozzle needed to be adjusted up or signifying that an inspection of the drive belt was needed.
Collection and disposal of the dirt has also changed over the years, but one component has remained, called the "Sani-Em-Tor".[5] This is a component attached to the discharge tube leading away from the vacuum turbine chamber where the suction is created. Earlier versions used a dense duvetyne, and later corduroy cotton fabric bag where the dirt, lint and other debris collected, allowing airflow to pass through and clean the air. The Sani Em-Tor trapped heavier material in the bottom, where a lid could be removed and the dirt disposed. The cotton bag also has an integrated cleaning pocket within, called the Sani-Pocket introduced in 1964 with the Sanitronic, where embedded dirt could be dislodged from the interior surface of the bag while keeping the dirt contained inside. Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, disposable paper bag was introduced optionally in addition to the cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. When the Generation 3 was introduced in 1990, the only method of dirt collection was the disposable paper bag, and was later labeled "Micron Magic" with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns.[5]
Versatility has also been a marketing feature, being able to configure the machine for various tasks. The attachments available have come and gone over the years, but some of the more popular ones remain available today. A floor buffer attachment and bare floor dusting pad were introduced with the Model 2C, along with a hand-held, paint spray gun and upholstery shampoo dispenser called the Suds-O-Gun, powered by attaching the hose to the turbine discharge tube have remained. A carpet shampoo attachment, called the Rug Renovator appeared with the Dual Sanitronic 50 in 1965.[5] Another unusual attachment, called the Handi-Butler introduced with the Model 516, used the turbine shaft at the front to power several devices, offered as convenience features that could sharpen knives, a cable could also be attached to a wire brush to remove rust from various surfaces, along with a lambs wool polishing disk, and a flannel buffing pad for more delicate tasks. The Handi-Butler was last offered with the Tradition model, and was replaced by the Turbo Sander with the Legend model.[5] The Turbo Sander was equipped with a small turbine inside the device, powered by the suction through the attachment hose, which can accommodate various grades of sand paper, scrubbing pads, and a soft, vinyl pad to be used as a massage unit that is still currently available.
During the mid-1970s, with the popularity of deep shag carpeting, a rake attachment called the Shag King,[5] was attached in front of the carpet nozzle to lift the fibers while cleaning the carpet, offered only on the Classic Omega, Classic III and the Tradition models. Another original attachment offered with the Model 2C, called the Crystalator, could be used to fumigate closets for insects and moths using moth balls, which was no longer available with the Legend Model in the late 1980s.
First Generation (1939-1969)[edit]

Model Names start with the 2C, followed by the 3C, 4C, 505 (introduction of Magic Finger Belt Lifter for Carpet Nozzle removal), 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 514, 516, 517, 518, 519, 560, 561, 562, Sanitronic VII, Dual Sanitronic 50 (introduction of two-speed motor for hose attachment and the Rug Renovator shampoo system), ending with the Dual Sanitronic 80.

Second Generation (1970-1989)[edit]

Model Names start with the Classic, followed with the Classic Omega, Classic III, Tradition (first introduction of disposable dust bag), Heritage, Heritage 2, Legend, ending with the Legend 2.

Third Generation (1990-present)[edit]

Model Names start with the Generation 3 (first introduction of TechDrive Power Assist), followed with the G4, G5, Gsix, G2000, G2001, Ultimate G, Ultimate G Diamond Edition, Sentria, Sentria II, ending with the Avalir.

Other units[edit]
Kirby ventured into small, portable, handheld units by reviving the Vacuette in the 1970s, then later producing the battery powered Split Second for small or light duty cleaning, which are powered by a 12V DC plug that runs in automobile cigarette lighters. In the 1980s, they also briefly offered a commercial model called the ComVac in three sizes, called the 1300, 1800 and the 2800. They were very basic and didn't come with the additional attachments or the shiny chrome appearance which are no longer sold.
Sales practice[edit]
Since 1920, new Kirby home care systems have only been sold through in-home demonstrations by independent, authorized Kirby distributors.[1] The Kirby Company manufactures the unit and sells it to a group of authorized distributors. Each distributor is an independent business, and as such sets their own price for the unit and conducts their own business operations. Independent distributors recruit dealers who are also independent contractors. The dealers sell the unit door-to-door and are generally compensated only through commission.[12]
Criticism of marketing and sales practices[edit]
The practices of some of Kirby's independent distributors have been subject to criticism. The Kirby is included by Lon L. Fuller and Melvin A. Eisenberg, Professors of Contract Law at Harvard Law School and UC Berkeley School of Law/Columbia Law School, as a textbook example of unconscionability.[13] Kirby has been subject to relentless criticism by consumer protection agencies.[3] As of 1999, of the 22 state consumer protection agencies, 15 had received a total of more than 600 complaints in just a few years.[3] Between 1996 and 1999, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection received 50 complaints regarding Kirby dealers, and concluded from its investigation that Kirby, through its distributors, engaged in a "statewide pattern of trade practices" violation of state consumer-protection laws.[3]
Many of the complaints involve "older customers who lack the will to stand up to grueling sales pitches."[3] The Wall Street Journal records examples where an elderly couple was unable to remove three Kirby salesmen from their home for over five hours; in another example, a disabled woman who had been living alone in a mobile home on $1000/month in Social Security payments and suffering from Alzheimer's disease was discovered to own two Kirby vacuum cleaners, having paid $1,700 for the second one.[3] In 2002, the Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner obtained $13,000 in refunds for 13 senior citizens.[14]
According to the Wall Street Journal, the device "costs more than four times what other top-of-the-line vacuum cleaners do."[3] Kirby compares the price difference to that between luxury and economy cars, yet "luxury-car dealers don't make house calls in trailer parks. But Kirby dealers do."[3] The Kirby vacuum cleaner is "marketed exclusively door-to-door — often to people who can ill afford a $1,500 gadget, but succumb to the sales pitch nonetheless."[3]
In 2001, the West Virginia Attorney General obtained more than $26,000 in refunds and credits for dissatisfied Kirby buyers.[14] In 2002, ABC's Primetime conducted a hidden-camera investigation in response to more than a thousand complaints regarding Kirby's salespeople.[14] In June 2004, the Arizona Attorney General filed suit against Kirby distributors for violations of the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, seeking an injunction against any other home sales.[14] Public authorities flooded with complaints about Kirby vacuum cleaners is not a recent phenomenon; even in the 1960s and 1970s, Kirby had been "cited by various agencies a number of times" and the Detroit Better Business Bureau had received so many complaints that it decided to turn the matter over to the Wayne County prosecutor.[15]
Kirby asserts it is not liable from actions of its sales force, whom it holds out as independent contractors.[3] Its "Distributor Code of Ethics" enumerates 12 principles, including "observe the highest standards of character, honesty and integrity in dealings with my customers, fellow Distributors and other members of the Kirby profession."[3] Kirby also teaches its distributors direct-sales laws, and requires them to resolve complaints within 24 hours under threat of termination.[3]
Litigation[edit]
Between 1998 and 2001, in Alabama alone, more than 100 lawsuits were filed against Kirby and its affiliates and subsidiaries, resulting in nearly $2 million in judgements and settlements.[16]
Twelve distributors of Kirby vacuums in Massachusetts were cited for violations of the Commonwealth's wage and hour laws by the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in July 2010. The 12 distributors were cited for a variety of different wage and hour violations including nonpayment of wage, nonpayment of minimum wage, misclassification, child labor, retaliation and record-keeping violations. The distributors were fined a total of $199,300 for the violations and also ordered to pay restitution.[17]
Sexual assault[edit]
The Supreme Court of Texas held Kirby liable for a rape committed by one of its door-to-door salesmen, finding that the manufacturer maintained control of its distributors and their salespeople, by requiring its distributors to make sales via in-home visits, and that the risk was foreseeable.[18] In that case, the court found that — had the employee's references been checked — Kirby would have discovered complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior at his previous employer and an arrest and deferred adjudication for indecency with a child.[19]
The North Dakota Supreme Court also held Kirby liable in a similar rape incident, where the salesman was hired after being convicted of assault and with charges of criminal sexual misconduct in the third degree pending against him.[20][21]
Fraud and RICO[edit]
A federal class-action lawsuit is pending against Kirby under the civil action provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), for allegedly selling used vacuums as new; the complaint alleges that "Not only is Kirby aware of this practice, it 'participates in the scheme by, among other things, selling to its distributors duplicate or replacement "Original Purchaser's Registration" cards to be given to secondhand purchasers.'"[22] The complaint also alleges that "Kirby commonly sells distributors new empty boxes and packaging material for the obvious purpose of repackaging units that the distributor previously sold to a prior customer."[23] Kirby's motion to dismiss was rejected.[22] After Kirby refused discovery requests for its sales contracts and other documents, Judge Clay D. Land compelled Kirby to disclose the requested documents.[24]
A class-action lawsuit was also filed against Kirby in Bullock County Court in Alabama over its sales practices, specifically its use of credit cards issued expressly to fund Kirby purchases, under Truth in Lending laws.[3] Kirby succeeded in persuading a trial judge to recuse himself.[25]
Actions against unauthorized dealers[edit]
Kirby has sued unauthorized Kirby vacuum dealers for United States trademark infringement where the vacuums are identified by the Kirby name and logo. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that such use does not constitute trademark infringement.[26][27] The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated an injunction granted in Kirby's favor by a lower court in that Circuit based on similar trademark claims against an unauthorized distributor.[28]
Kirby also did not prevail in a similar action against an unauthorized dealer in Minnesota, where it asserted trademark infringement, false and unfair competition, and trade disparagement; the authorized dealer prevailed on a $90,000 counterclaim against Kirby for defamation and then in a suit against an insurer who refused to defend the suit when the dealer refused Kirby's settlement offer.[29][30] Kirby's parent lost another such suit in Minnesota based on trademark infringement and other related state law claims.[31]
Nor did Kirby prevail in a tortious interference with contractual relations claim in Washington against an unauthorized retailer; the Washington Supreme Court awarded attorney's fees to the retailer.[32] However, Kirby has prevailed in cases where unauthorized retailers went farther than using the name and logo to identify the vacuum cleaner, misrepresenting themselves as the manufacturer and claiming the existence of factory warranty.[33]

History[edit]




Kirby Sentria Chrome Edition


The first Kirby vacuums were designed by James B. Kirby (1885–1971) for George Scott and Carl Fetzer after World War I, although the Kirby name was not used on a vacuum cleaner until the 1930s.[2] James Kirby invented the "vacuette" circa 1920, and their primary competitors were The Hoover Company and The Eureka Company which both began operations in 1909, and Bissell who originally built carpet sweepers beginning in 1876.[3]
The Vacuette Electric, introduced in 1925 with its removable floor nozzle and handle, became the forerunner of today's multi-attachment Kirby vacuum models. In 1935, the company introduced the Kirby Model C, the first product to carry Jim Kirby's name.[4] The Vacuette was also briefly offered without an electric motor, utilizing a spring-loaded worm gear driven by pulling the vacuum cleaner backwards, then when pushing the machine forward, the worm gear would power a turbine that provided the suction needed. It was designed for rural areas that didn't have electricity, and was very similar to the carpet sweeper.
While competitors have changed the orientation of the motor, their products appearance, materials used in construction and other features over the years, Kirby has remained with the original machines design, materials used and functionality with enhancements added to aide in its operation and durability. The company changes the appearance with revised color schemes and introduces new model names while keeping the core technology intact.[5]
In 1970, input from Kirby distributors, dealers, management and customers guided Kirby engineers in developing the Kirby Classic. This ushered in the second generation models, and was an instant success, with soaring sales, forcing the company to expand its manufacturing facilities outside of Cleveland for the first time. In 1972, Kirby West began operations in Andrews, Texas at 1345 NW 101 Street. The facility doubled the company's manufacturing capabilities.[4] The company did maintain a presence in Canada at 1009 Burns Street East in Whitby which is no longer staffed.
Berkshire Hathaway bought Kirby parent Scott Fetzer in 1986 for $315 million.[3] Two years prior, Ivan Boesky had offered to buy Scott Fetzer for $60 a share, or $420 million.[6] Warren Buffett has singled out Scott Fetzer to Berkshire's shareholders as the "prototype" for the "kind of company — and acquisition — he was interested in."[7] According to Berkshire managers, "absolutely no changes were made to the existing Scott Fetzer business or management, and the entire business (and its jet) was preserved."[8]
As of 2003, Kirby is the largest source of revenue and profit for Scott Fetzer, with approximately 500,000 sales per year, about a third of which are outside the United States.[9] In 2003, Scott Fetzer sold the vacuums to about 835 factory distributors, who in turn sell the vacuums door-to-door.[9] As an incentive to new customers, Kirby offers the Service Center Vacuum Rebuild Program for original owners who have been registered with the company. As long as the customer owns the machine as the registered owner, if the cleaner needs repair, they can send it back to the Rebuild Department and have it restored to “like new” condition. The company will completely disassemble it, repair or replace any worn Kirby parts, and sandblast, polish and buff metal parts back to a shiny “new” appearance. Internal components are also thoroughly inspected and repaired with Kirby replacement parts so that it will perform as originally designed.[10]
Kirby unit models[edit]




A Kirby G5 upright vacuum cleaner


The Kirby Company generally produces only one model at a time. Kirby's vacuums made until 1919 were made by Frantz Premier. Those made from 1919 to 1934 are branded and made by The Scott & Fetzer Company. After 1934 all machines have been made by Scott & Fetzer, though branded as Kirby.
From 1935 through the 1980s, continuous improvements and refinements were made to the Kirby home care system. One of the popular selling points is that it can be easily configured into a canister vacuum, hand portable vacuum, air pump, floor polisher, and more. It can also be converted into a shampoo system for carpets and a sweeping, dusting, and mopping system for bare floors. [11][4] The characteristic chrome appearance is due to the bulk of the machine is assembled from aluminum, a tradition going back to the very early days of manufacture.
Beginning in the 1990s, the Generation series ushered in a new platform for the cleaner. The addition of TechDrive variable power assist eliminated 90% of the effort required to move the unit back and forth.[4] The current model, the Avalir, continues the tradition that converts the vacuum into several different units beginning with the Model 508 in 1948. With most vacuum cleaner models, the rubber drive belt that powers the brush bar, an integral component with most modern machines, remains in place and is only examined when it breaks. Vacuum attachments are available on other machines but don't require the drive belt to be disconnected. Kirby attachments are connected to the power unit, and disconnecting the drive belt is usually involved in the process that add to its flexibility.[5]
One of the key procedures for using a Kirby Vacuum is the correct way to adjust the carpet nozzle for the best possible results. Starting with the 1939 Model 2C to the most current machine, the instruction manual states that the carpet nozzle should be gradually lowered into position with the Toe-Touch latch[5], incrementally adjusting the rug nozzle until the rotating vibrating brush establishes contact, and the sound of the motor changes indicating suction has been achieved. With the introduction of the Model 505, the power switch was relocated from the top of the handle to the motor itself, so the handle could be removed and the machine converted to a portable unit with a shoulder strap so that cleaning in difficult areas could be performed, and the machine converted into a canister-type cleaner with a long hose attached to the front for dusting tasks.
Starting with the Model 505, adjusting the carpet nozzle employed what Kirby called "Triple Cushioned Vibration Rug Cleaning Action".[5] This involved briefly lifting the carpet up off the floor with the significant suction created by the machine, thereby cushioning the area to be cleaned off of the floor, while the rotating vibrating brush separated the carpet fibers, thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating the carpet fibers. Earlier methods instructed that the carpet nozzle must maintain contact with the surface of the carpet, utilizing the suction, while later instruction manuals recommended the nozzle be slightly above with only the brush establishing contact and improving airflow around the surface being cleaned. For delicate surfaces, the drive belt that spins the brush can be detached so that only suction is used. When the Heritage Model was introduced in 1982, the Brush Performance Indicator Light was installed in the top of the carpet nozzle, which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush. A small LED bulb would light up when the brush was spinning; if the light appeared to blink or wasn't illuminated, it meant the brush wasn't rotating at the desired speed, and that the nozzle needed to be adjusted up or signifying that an inspection of the drive belt was needed.
Collection and disposal of the dirt has also changed over the years, but one component has remained, called the "Sani-Em-Tor".[5] This is a component attached to the discharge tube leading away from the vacuum turbine chamber where the suction is created. Earlier versions used a dense duvetyne, and later corduroy cotton fabric bag where the dirt, lint and other debris collected, allowing airflow to pass through and clean the air. The Sani Em-Tor trapped heavier material in the bottom, where a lid could be removed and the dirt disposed. The cotton bag also has an integrated cleaning pocket within, called the Sani-Pocket introduced in 1964 with the Sanitronic, where embedded dirt could be dislodged from the interior surface of the bag while keeping the dirt contained inside. Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, disposable paper bag was introduced optionally in addition to the cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. When the Generation 3 was introduced in 1990, the only method of dirt collection was the disposable paper bag, and was later labeled "Micron Magic" with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns.[5]
Versatility has also been a marketing feature, being able to configure the machine for various tasks. The attachments available have come and gone over the years, but some of the more popular ones remain available today. A floor buffer attachment and bare floor dusting pad were introduced with the Model 2C, along with a hand-held, paint spray gun and upholstery shampoo dispenser called the Suds-O-Gun, powered by attaching the hose to the turbine discharge tube have remained. A carpet shampoo attachment, called the Rug Renovator appeared with the Dual Sanitronic 50 in 1965.[5] Another unusual attachment, called the Handi-Butler introduced with the Model 516, used the turbine shaft at the front to power several devices, offered as convenience features that could sharpen knives, a cable could also be attached to a wire brush to remove rust from various surfaces, along with a lambs wool polishing disk, and a flannel buffing pad for more delicate tasks. The Handi-Butler was last offered with the Tradition model, and was replaced by the Turbo Sander with the Legend model.[5] The Turbo Sander was equipped with a small turbine inside the device, powered by the suction through the attachment hose, which can accommodate various grades of sand paper, scrubbing pads, and a soft, vinyl pad to be used as a massage unit that is still currently available.
During the mid-1970s, with the popularity of deep shag carpeting, a rake attachment called the Shag King,[5] was attached in front of the carpet nozzle to lift the fibers while cleaning the carpet, offered only on the Classic Omega, Classic III and the Tradition models. Another original attachment offered with the Model 2C, called the Crystalator, could be used to fumigate closets for insects and moths using moth balls, which was no longer available with the Legend Model in the late 1980s.
First Generation (1939-1969)[edit]

Model Names start with the 2C, followed by the 3C, 4C, 505 (introduction of Magic Finger Belt Lifter for Carpet Nozzle removal), 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 514, 516, 517, 518, 519, 560, 561, 562, Sanitronic VII, Dual Sanitronic 50 (introduction of two-speed motor for hose attachment and the Rug Renovator shampoo system), ending with the Dual Sanitronic 80.

Second Generation (1970-1989)[edit]

Model Names start with the Classic, followed with the Classic Omega, Classic III, Tradition (first introduction of disposable dust bag), Heritage, Heritage 2, Legend, ending with the Legend 2.

Third Generation (1990-present)[edit]

Model Names start with the Generation 3 (first introduction of TechDrive Power Assist), followed with the G4, G5, Gsix, G2000, G2001, Ultimate G, Ultimate G Diamond Edition, Sentria, Sentria II, ending with the Avalir.

Other units[edit]
Kirby ventured into small, portable, handheld units by reviving the Vacuette in the 1970s, then later producing the battery powered Split Second for small or light duty cleaning, which are powered by a 12V DC plug that runs in automobile cigarette lighters. In the 1980s, they also briefly offered a commercial model called the ComVac in three sizes, called the 1300, 1800 and the 2800. They were very basic and didn't come with the additional attachments or the shiny chrome appearance which are no longer sold.
Sales practice[edit]
Since 1920, new Kirby home care systems have only been sold through in-home demonstrations by independent, authorized Kirby distributors.[1] The Kirby Company manufactures the unit and sells it to a group of authorized distributors. Each distributor is an independent business, and as such sets their own price for the unit and conducts their own business operations. Independent distributors recruit dealers who are also independent contractors. The dealers sell the unit door-to-door and are generally compensated only through commission.[12]
Criticism of marketing and sales practices[edit]
The practices of some of Kirby's independent distributors have been subject to criticism. The Kirby is included by Lon L. Fuller and Melvin A. Eisenberg, Professors of Contract Law at Harvard Law School and UC Berkeley School of Law/Columbia Law School, as a textbook example of unconscionability.[13] Kirby has been subject to relentless criticism by consumer protection agencies.[3] As of 1999, of the 22 state consumer protection agencies, 15 had received a total of more than 600 complaints in just a few years.[3] Between 1996 and 1999, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection received 50 complaints regarding Kirby dealers, and concluded from its investigation that Kirby, through its distributors, engaged in a "statewide pattern of trade practices" violation of state consumer-protection laws.[3]
Many of the complaints involve "older customers who lack the will to stand up to grueling sales pitches."[3] The Wall Street Journal records examples where an elderly couple was unable to remove three Kirby salesmen from their home for over five hours; in another example, a disabled woman who had been living alone in a mobile home on $1000/month in Social Security payments and suffering from Alzheimer's disease was discovered to own two Kirby vacuum cleaners, having paid $1,700 for the second one.[3] In 2002, the Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner obtained $13,000 in refunds for 13 senior citizens.[14]
According to the Wall Street Journal, the device "costs more than four times what other top-of-the-line vacuum cleaners do."[3] Kirby compares the price difference to that between luxury and economy cars, yet "luxury-car dealers don't make house calls in trailer parks. But Kirby dealers do."[3] The Kirby vacuum cleaner is "marketed exclusively door-to-door — often to people who can ill afford a $1,500 gadget, but succumb to the sales pitch nonetheless."[3]
In 2001, the West Virginia Attorney General obtained more than $26,000 in refunds and credits for dissatisfied Kirby buyers.[14] In 2002, ABC's Primetime conducted a hidden-camera investigation in response to more than a thousand complaints regarding Kirby's salespeople.[14] In June 2004, the Arizona Attorney General filed suit against Kirby distributors for violations of the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, seeking an injunction against any other home sales.[14] Public authorities flooded with complaints about Kirby vacuum cleaners is not a recent phenomenon; even in the 1960s and 1970s, Kirby had been "cited by various agencies a number of times" and the Detroit Better Business Bureau had received so many complaints that it decided to turn the matter over to the Wayne County prosecutor.[15]
Kirby asserts it is not liable from actions of its sales force, whom it holds out as independent contractors.[3] Its "Distributor Code of Ethics" enumerates 12 principles, including "observe the highest standards of character, honesty and integrity in dealings with my customers, fellow Distributors and other members of the Kirby profession."[3] Kirby also teaches its distributors direct-sales laws, and requires them to resolve complaints within 24 hours under threat of termination.[3]
Litigation[edit]
Between 1998 and 2001, in Alabama alone, more than 100 lawsuits were filed against Kirby and its affiliates and subsidiaries, resulting in nearly $2 million in judgements and settlements.[16]
Twelve distributors of Kirby vacuums in Massachusetts were cited for violations of the Commonwealth's wage and hour laws by the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in July 2010. The 12 distributors were cited for a variety of different wage and hour violations including nonpayment of wage, nonpayment of minimum wage, misclassification, child labor, retaliation and record-keeping violations. The distributors were fined a total of $199,300 for the violations and also ordered to pay restitution.[17]
Sexual assault[edit]
The Supreme Court of Texas held Kirby liable for a rape committed by one of its door-to-door salesmen, finding that the manufacturer maintained control of its distributors and their salespeople, by requiring its distributors to make sales via in-home visits, and that the risk was foreseeable.[18] In that case, the court found that — had the employee's references been checked — Kirby would have discovered complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior at his previous employer and an arrest and deferred adjudication for indecency with a child.[19]
The North Dakota Supreme Court also held Kirby liable in a similar rape incident, where the salesman was hired after being convicted of assault and with charges of criminal sexual misconduct in the third degree pending against him.[20][21]
Fraud and RICO[edit]
A federal class-action lawsuit is pending against Kirby under the civil action provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), for allegedly selling used vacuums as new; the complaint alleges that "Not only is Kirby aware of this practice, it 'participates in the scheme by, among other things, selling to its distributors duplicate or replacement "Original Purchaser's Registration" cards to be given to secondhand purchasers.'"[22] The complaint also alleges that "Kirby commonly sells distributors new empty boxes and packaging material for the obvious purpose of repackaging units that the distributor previously sold to a prior customer."[23] Kirby's motion to dismiss was rejected.[22] After Kirby refused discovery requests for its sales contracts and other documents, Judge Clay D. Land compelled Kirby to disclose the requested documents.[24]
A class-action lawsuit was also filed against Kirby in Bullock County Court in Alabama over its sales practices, specifically its use of credit cards issued expressly to fund Kirby purchases, under Truth in Lending laws.[3] Kirby succeeded in persuading a trial judge to recuse himself.[25]
Actions against unauthorized dealers[edit]
Kirby has sued unauthorized Kirby vacuum dealers for United States trademark infringement where the vacuums are identified by the Kirby name and logo. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that such use does not constitute trademark infringement.[26][27] The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated an injunction granted in Kirby's favor by a lower court in that Circuit based on similar trademark claims against an unauthorized distributor.[28]
Kirby also did not prevail in a similar action against an unauthorized dealer in Minnesota, where it asserted trademark infringement, false and unfair competition, and trade disparagement; the authorized dealer prevailed on a $90,000 counterclaim against Kirby for defamation and then in a suit against an insurer who refused to defend the suit when the dealer refused Kirby's settlement offer.[29][30] Kirby's parent lost another such suit in Minnesota based on trademark infringement and other related state law claims.[31]
Nor did Kirby prevail in a tortious interference with contractual relations claim in Washington against an unauthorized retailer; the Washington Supreme Court awarded attorney's fees to the retailer.[32] However, Kirby has prevailed in cases where unauthorized retailers went farther than using the name and logo to identify the vacuum cleaner, misrepresenting themselves as the manufacturer and claiming the existence of factory warranty.[33]

History[edit]




Kirby Sentria Chrome Edition


The first Kirby vacuums were designed by James B. Kirby (1885–1971) for George Scott and Carl Fetzer after World War I, although the Kirby name was not used on a vacuum cleaner until the 1930s.[2] James Kirby invented the "vacuette" circa 1920, and their primary competitors were The Hoover Company and The Eureka Company which both began operations in 1909, and Bissell who originally built carpet sweepers beginning in 1876.[3]
The Vacuette Electric, introduced in 1925 with its removable floor nozzle and handle, became the forerunner of today's multi-attachment Kirby vacuum models. In 1935, the company introduced the Kirby Model C, the first product to carry Jim Kirby's name.[4] The Vacuette was also briefly offered without an electric motor, utilizing a spring-loaded worm gear driven by pulling the vacuum cleaner backwards, then when pushing the machine forward, the worm gear would power a turbine that provided the suction needed. It was designed for rural areas that didn't have electricity, and was very similar to the carpet sweeper.
While competitors have changed the orientation of the motor, their products appearance, materials used in construction and other features over the years, Kirby has remained with the original machines design, materials used and functionality with enhancements added to aide in its operation and durability. The company changes the appearance with revised color schemes and introduces new model names while keeping the core technology intact.[5]
In 1970, input from Kirby distributors, dealers, management and customers guided Kirby engineers in developing the Kirby Classic. This ushered in the second generation models, and was an instant success, with soaring sales, forcing the company to expand its manufacturing facilities outside of Cleveland for the first time. In 1972, Kirby West began operations in Andrews, Texas at 1345 NW 101 Street. The facility doubled the company's manufacturing capabilities.[4] The company did maintain a presence in Canada at 1009 Burns Street East in Whitby which is no longer staffed.
Berkshire Hathaway bought Kirby parent Scott Fetzer in 1986 for $315 million.[3] Two years prior, Ivan Boesky had offered to buy Scott Fetzer for $60 a share, or $420 million.[6] Warren Buffett has singled out Scott Fetzer to Berkshire's shareholders as the "prototype" for the "kind of company — and acquisition — he was interested in."[7] According to Berkshire managers, "absolutely no changes were made to the existing Scott Fetzer business or management, and the entire business (and its jet) was preserved."[8]
As of 2003, Kirby is the largest source of revenue and profit for Scott Fetzer, with approximately 500,000 sales per year, about a third of which are outside the United States.[9] In 2003, Scott Fetzer sold the vacuums to about 835 factory distributors, who in turn sell the vacuums door-to-door.[9] As an incentive to new customers, Kirby offers the Service Center Vacuum Rebuild Program for original owners who have been registered with the company. As long as the customer owns the machine as the registered owner, if the cleaner needs repair, they can send it back to the Rebuild Department and have it restored to “like new” condition. The company will completely disassemble it, repair or replace any worn Kirby parts, and sandblast, polish and buff metal parts back to a shiny “new” appearance. Internal components are also thoroughly inspected and repaired with Kirby replacement parts so that it will perform as originally designed.[10]
Kirby unit models[edit]




A Kirby G5 upright vacuum cleaner


The Kirby Company generally produces only one model at a time. Kirby's vacuums made until 1919 were made by Frantz Premier. Those made from 1919 to 1934 are branded and made by The Scott & Fetzer Company. After 1934 all machines have been made by Scott & Fetzer, though branded as Kirby.
From 1935 through the 1980s, continuous improvements and refinements were made to the Kirby home care system. One of the popular selling points is that it can be easily configured into a canister vacuum, hand portable vacuum, air pump, floor polisher, and more. It can also be converted into a shampoo system for carpets and a sweeping, dusting, and mopping system for bare floors. [11][4] The characteristic chrome appearance is due to the bulk of the machine is assembled from aluminum, a tradition going back to the very early days of manufacture.
Beginning in the 1990s, the Generation series ushered in a new platform for the cleaner. The addition of TechDrive variable power assist eliminated 90% of the effort required to move the unit back and forth.[4] The current model, the Avalir, continues the tradition that converts the vacuum into several different units beginning with the Model 508 in 1948. With most vacuum cleaner models, the rubber drive belt that powers the brush bar, an integral component with most modern machines, remains in place and is only examined when it breaks. Vacuum attachments are available on other machines but don't require the drive belt to be disconnected. Kirby attachments are connected to the power unit, and disconnecting the drive belt is usually involved in the process that add to its flexibility.[5]
One of the key procedures for using a Kirby Vacuum is the correct way to adjust the carpet nozzle for the best possible results. Starting with the 1939 Model 2C to the most current machine, the instruction manual states that the carpet nozzle should be gradually lowered into position with the Toe-Touch latch[5], incrementally adjusting the rug nozzle until the rotating vibrating brush establishes contact, and the sound of the motor changes indicating suction has been achieved. With the introduction of the Model 505, the power switch was relocated from the top of the handle to the motor itself, so the handle could be removed and the machine converted to a portable unit with a shoulder strap so that cleaning in difficult areas could be performed, and the machine converted into a canister-type cleaner with a long hose attached to the front for dusting tasks.
Starting with the Model 505, adjusting the carpet nozzle employed what Kirby called "Triple Cushioned Vibration Rug Cleaning Action".[5] This involved briefly lifting the carpet up off the floor with the significant suction created by the machine, thereby cushioning the area to be cleaned off of the floor, while the rotating vibrating brush separated the carpet fibers, thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating the carpet fibers. Earlier methods instructed that the carpet nozzle must maintain contact with the surface of the carpet, utilizing the suction, while later instruction manuals recommended the nozzle be slightly above with only the brush establishing contact and improving airflow around the surface being cleaned. For delicate surfaces, the drive belt that spins the brush can be detached so that only suction is used. When the Heritage Model was introduced in 1982, the Brush Performance Indicator Light was installed in the top of the carpet nozzle, which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush. A small LED bulb would light up when the brush was spinning; if the light appeared to blink or wasn't illuminated, it meant the brush wasn't rotating at the desired speed, and that the nozzle needed to be adjusted up or signifying that an inspection of the drive belt was needed.
Collection and disposal of the dirt has also changed over the years, but one component has remained, called the "Sani-Em-Tor".[5] This is a component attached to the discharge tube leading away from the vacuum turbine chamber where the suction is created. Earlier versions used a dense duvetyne, and later corduroy cotton fabric bag where the dirt, lint and other debris collected, allowing airflow to pass through and clean the air. The Sani Em-Tor trapped heavier material in the bottom, where a lid could be removed and the dirt disposed. The cotton bag also has an integrated cleaning pocket within, called the Sani-Pocket introduced in 1964 with the Sanitronic, where embedded dirt could be dislodged from the interior surface of the bag while keeping the dirt contained inside. Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, disposable paper bag was introduced optionally in addition to the cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. When the Generation 3 was introduced in 1990, the only method of dirt collection was the disposable paper bag, and was later labeled "Micron Magic" with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns.[5]
Versatility has also been a marketing feature, being able to configure the machine for various tasks. The attachments available have come and gone over the years, but some of the more popular ones remain available today. A floor buffer attachment and bare floor dusting pad were introduced with the Model 2C, along with a hand-held, paint spray gun and upholstery shampoo dispenser called the Suds-O-Gun, powered by attaching the hose to the turbine discharge tube have remained. A carpet shampoo attachment, called the Rug Renovator appeared with the Dual Sanitronic 50 in 1965.[5] Another unusual attachment, called the Handi-Butler introduced with the Model 516, used the turbine shaft at the front to power several devices, offered as convenience features that could sharpen knives, a cable could also be attached to a wire brush to remove rust from various surfaces, along with a lambs wool polishing disk, and a flannel buffing pad for more delicate tasks. The Handi-Butler was last offered with the Tradition model, and was replaced by the Turbo Sander with the Legend model.[5] The Turbo Sander was equipped with a small turbine inside the device, powered by the suction through the attachment hose, which can accommodate various grades of sand paper, scrubbing pads, and a soft, vinyl pad to be used as a massage unit that is still currently available.
During the mid-1970s, with the popularity of deep shag carpeting, a rake attachment called the Shag King,[5] was attached in front of the carpet nozzle to lift the fibers while cleaning the carpet, offered only on the Classic Omega, Classic III and the Tradition models. Another original attachment offered with the Model 2C, called the Crystalator, could be used to fumigate closets for insects and moths using moth balls, which was no longer available with the Legend Model in the late 1980s.
First Generation (1939-1969)[edit]

Model Names start with the 2C, followed by the 3C, 4C, 505 (introduction of Magic Finger Belt Lifter for Carpet Nozzle removal), 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 514, 516, 517, 518, 519, 560, 561, 562, Sanitronic VII, Dual Sanitronic 50 (introduction of two-speed motor for hose attachment and the Rug Renovator shampoo system), ending with the Dual Sanitronic 80.

Second Generation (1970-1989)[edit]

Model Names start with the Classic, followed with the Classic Omega, Classic III, Tradition (first introduction of disposable dust bag), Heritage, Heritage 2, Legend, ending with the Legend 2.

Third Generation (1990-present)[edit]

Model Names start with the Generation 3 (first introduction of TechDrive Power Assist), followed with the G4, G5, Gsix, G2000, G2001, Ultimate G, Ultimate G Diamond Edition, Sentria, Sentria II, ending with the Avalir.

Other units[edit]
Kirby ventured into small, portable, handheld units by reviving the Vacuette in the 1970s, then later producing the battery powered Split Second for small or light duty cleaning, which are powered by a 12V DC plug that runs in automobile cigarette lighters. In the 1980s, they also briefly offered a commercial model called the ComVac in three sizes, called the 1300, 1800 and the 2800. They were very basic and didn't come with the additional attachments or the shiny chrome appearance which are no longer sold.
Sales practice[edit]
Since 1920, new Kirby home care systems have only been sold through in-home demonstrations by independent, authorized Kirby distributors.[1] The Kirby Company manufactures the unit and sells it to a group of authorized distributors. Each distributor is an independent business, and as such sets their own price for the unit and conducts their own business operations. Independent distributors recruit dealers who are also independent contractors. The dealers sell the unit door-to-door and are generally compensated only through commission.[12]
Criticism of marketing and sales practices[edit]
The practices of some of Kirby's independent distributors have been subject to criticism. The Kirby is included by Lon L. Fuller and Melvin A. Eisenberg, Professors of Contract Law at Harvard Law School and UC Berkeley School of Law/Columbia Law School, as a textbook example of unconscionability.[13] Kirby has been subject to relentless criticism by consumer protection agencies.[3] As of 1999, of the 22 state consumer protection agencies, 15 had received a total of more than 600 complaints in just a few years.[3] Between 1996 and 1999, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection received 50 complaints regarding Kirby dealers, and concluded from its investigation that Kirby, through its distributors, engaged in a "statewide pattern of trade practices" violation of state consumer-protection laws.[3]
Many of the complaints involve "older customers who lack the will to stand up to grueling sales pitches."[3] The Wall Street Journal records examples where an elderly couple was unable to remove three Kirby salesmen from their home for over five hours; in another example, a disabled woman who had been living alone in a mobile home on $1000/month in Social Security payments and suffering from Alzheimer's disease was discovered to own two Kirby vacuum cleaners, having paid $1,700 for the second one.[3] In 2002, the Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner obtained $13,000 in refunds for 13 senior citizens.[14]
According to the Wall Street Journal, the device "costs more than four times what other top-of-the-line vacuum cleaners do."[3] Kirby compares the price difference to that between luxury and economy cars, yet "luxury-car dealers don't make house calls in trailer parks. But Kirby dealers do."[3] The Kirby vacuum cleaner is "marketed exclusively door-to-door — often to people who can ill afford a $1,500 gadget, but succumb to the sales pitch nonetheless."[3]
In 2001, the West Virginia Attorney General obtained more than $26,000 in refunds and credits for dissatisfied Kirby buyers.[14] In 2002, ABC's Primetime conducted a hidden-camera investigation in response to more than a thousand complaints regarding Kirby's salespeople.[14] In June 2004, the Arizona Attorney General filed suit against Kirby distributors for violations of the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, seeking an injunction against any other home sales.[14] Public authorities flooded with complaints about Kirby vacuum cleaners is not a recent phenomenon; even in the 1960s and 1970s, Kirby had been "cited by various agencies a number of times" and the Detroit Better Business Bureau had received so many complaints that it decided to turn the matter over to the Wayne County prosecutor.[15]
Kirby asserts it is not liable from actions of its sales force, whom it holds out as independent contractors.[3] Its "Distributor Code of Ethics" enumerates 12 principles, including "observe the highest standards of character, honesty and integrity in dealings with my customers, fellow Distributors and other members of the Kirby profession."[3] Kirby also teaches its distributors direct-sales laws, and requires them to resolve complaints within 24 hours under threat of termination.[3]
Litigation[edit]
Between 1998 and 2001, in Alabama alone, more than 100 lawsuits were filed against Kirby and its affiliates and subsidiaries, resulting in nearly $2 million in judgements and settlements.[16]
Twelve distributors of Kirby vacuums in Massachusetts were cited for violations of the Commonwealth's wage and hour laws by the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in July 2010. The 12 distributors were cited for a variety of different wage and hour violations including nonpayment of wage, nonpayment of minimum wage, misclassification, child labor, retaliation and record-keeping violations. The distributors were fined a total of $199,300 for the violations and also ordered to pay restitution.[17]
Sexual assault[edit]
The Supreme Court of Texas held Kirby liable for a rape committed by one of its door-to-door salesmen, finding that the manufacturer maintained control of its distributors and their salespeople, by requiring its distributors to make sales via in-home visits, and that the risk was foreseeable.[18] In that case, the court found that — had the employee's references been checked — Kirby would have discovered complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior at his previous employer and an arrest and deferred adjudication for indecency with a child.[19]
The North Dakota Supreme Court also held Kirby liable in a similar rape incident, where the salesman was hired after being convicted of assault and with charges of criminal sexual misconduct in the third degree pending against him.[20][21]
Fraud and RICO[edit]
A federal class-action lawsuit is pending against Kirby under the civil action provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), for allegedly selling used vacuums as new; the complaint alleges that "Not only is Kirby aware of this practice, it 'participates in the scheme by, among other things, selling to its distributors duplicate or replacement "Original Purchaser's Registration" cards to be given to secondhand purchasers.'"[22] The complaint also alleges that "Kirby commonly sells distributors new empty boxes and packaging material for the obvious purpose of repackaging units that the distributor previously sold to a prior customer."[23] Kirby's motion to dismiss was rejected.[22] After Kirby refused discovery requests for its sales contracts and other documents, Judge Clay D. Land compelled Kirby to disclose the requested documents.[24]
A class-action lawsuit was also filed against Kirby in Bullock County Court in Alabama over its sales practices, specifically its use of credit cards issued expressly to fund Kirby purchases, under Truth in Lending laws.[3] Kirby succeeded in persuading a trial judge to recuse himself.[25]
Actions against unauthorized dealers[edit]
Kirby has sued unauthorized Kirby vacuum dealers for United States trademark infringement where the vacuums are identified by the Kirby name and logo. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that such use does not constitute trademark infringement.[26][27] The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated an injunction granted in Kirby's favor by a lower court in that Circuit based on similar trademark claims against an unauthorized distributor.[28]
Kirby also did not prevail in a similar action against an unauthorized dealer in Minnesota, where it asserted trademark infringement, false and unfair competition, and trade disparagement; the authorized dealer prevailed on a $90,000 counterclaim against Kirby for defamation and then in a suit against an insurer who refused to defend the suit when the dealer refused Kirby's settlement offer.[29][30] Kirby's parent lost another such suit in Minnesota based on trademark infringement and other related state law claims.[31]
Nor did Kirby prevail in a tortious interference with contractual relations claim in Washington against an unauthorized retailer; the Washington Supreme Court awarded attorney's fees to the retailer.[32] However, Kirby has prevailed in cases where unauthorized retailers went farther than using the name and logo to identify the vacuum cleaner, misrepresenting themselves as the manufacturer and claiming the existence of factory warranty.[33]

History[edit]




Kirby Sentria Chrome Edition


The first Kirby vacuums were designed by James B. Kirby (1885–1971) for George Scott and Carl Fetzer after World War I, although the Kirby name was not used on a vacuum cleaner until the 1930s.[2] James Kirby invented the "vacuette" circa 1920, and their primary competitors were The Hoover Company and The Eureka Company which both began operations in 1909, and Bissell who originally built carpet sweepers beginning in 1876.[3]
The Vacuette Electric, introduced in 1925 with its removable floor nozzle and handle, became the forerunner of today's multi-attachment Kirby vacuum models. In 1935, the company introduced the Kirby Model C, the first product to carry Jim Kirby's name.[4] The Vacuette was also briefly offered without an electric motor, utilizing a spring-loaded worm gear driven by pulling the vacuum cleaner backwards, then when pushing the machine forward, the worm gear would power a turbine that provided the suction needed. It was designed for rural areas that didn't have electricity, and was very similar to the carpet sweeper.
While competitors have changed the orientation of the motor, their products appearance, materials used in construction and other features over the years, Kirby has remained with the original machines design, materials used and functionality with enhancements added to aide in its operation and durability. The company changes the appearance with revised color schemes and introduces new model names while keeping the core technology intact.[5]
In 1970, input from Kirby distributors, dealers, management and customers guided Kirby engineers in developing the Kirby Classic. This ushered in the second generation models, and was an instant success, with soaring sales, forcing the company to expand its manufacturing facilities outside of Cleveland for the first time. In 1972, Kirby West began operations in Andrews, Texas at 1345 NW 101 Street. The facility doubled the company's manufacturing capabilities.[4] The company did maintain a presence in Canada at 1009 Burns Street East in Whitby which is no longer staffed.
Berkshire Hathaway bought Kirby parent Scott Fetzer in 1986 for $315 million.[3] Two years prior, Ivan Boesky had offered to buy Scott Fetzer for $60 a share, or $420 million.[6] Warren Buffett has singled out Scott Fetzer to Berkshire's shareholders as the "prototype" for the "kind of company — and acquisition — he was interested in."[7] According to Berkshire managers, "absolutely no changes were made to the existing Scott Fetzer business or management, and the entire business (and its jet) was preserved."[8]
As of 2003, Kirby is the largest source of revenue and profit for Scott Fetzer, with approximately 500,000 sales per year, about a third of which are outside the United States.[9] In 2003, Scott Fetzer sold the vacuums to about 835 factory distributors, who in turn sell the vacuums door-to-door.[9] As an incentive to new customers, Kirby offers the Service Center Vacuum Rebuild Program for original owners who have been registered with the company. As long as the customer owns the machine as the registered owner, if the cleaner needs repair, they can send it back to the Rebuild Department and have it restored to “like new” condition. The company will completely disassemble it, repair or replace any worn Kirby parts, and sandblast, polish and buff metal parts back to a shiny “new” appearance. Internal components are also thoroughly inspected and repaired with Kirby replacement parts so that it will perform as originally designed.[10]
Kirby unit models[edit]




A Kirby G5 upright vacuum cleaner


The Kirby Company generally produces only one model at a time. Kirby's vacuums made until 1919 were made by Frantz Premier. Those made from 1919 to 1934 are branded and made by The Scott & Fetzer Company. After 1934 all machines have been made by Scott & Fetzer, though branded as Kirby.
From 1935 through the 1980s, continuous improvements and refinements were made to the Kirby home care system. One of the popular selling points is that it can be easily configured into a canister vacuum, hand portable vacuum, air pump, floor polisher, and more. It can also be converted into a shampoo system for carpets and a sweeping, dusting, and mopping system for bare floors. [11][4] The characteristic chrome appearance is due to the bulk of the machine is assembled from aluminum, a tradition going back to the very early days of manufacture.
Beginning in the 1990s, the Generation series ushered in a new platform for the cleaner. The addition of TechDrive variable power assist eliminated 90% of the effort required to move the unit back and forth.[4] The current model, the Avalir, continues the tradition that converts the vacuum into several different units beginning with the Model 508 in 1948. With most vacuum cleaner models, the rubber drive belt that powers the brush bar, an integral component with most modern machines, remains in place and is only examined when it breaks. Vacuum attachments are available on other machines but don't require the drive belt to be disconnected. Kirby attachments are connected to the power unit, and disconnecting the drive belt is usually involved in the process that add to its flexibility.[5]
One of the key procedures for using a Kirby Vacuum is the correct way to adjust the carpet nozzle for the best possible results. Starting with the 1939 Model 2C to the most current machine, the instruction manual states that the carpet nozzle should be gradually lowered into position with the Toe-Touch latch[5], incrementally adjusting the rug nozzle until the rotating vibrating brush establishes contact, and the sound of the motor changes indicating suction has been achieved. With the introduction of the Model 505, the power switch was relocated from the top of the handle to the motor itself, so the handle could be removed and the machine converted to a portable unit with a shoulder strap so that cleaning in difficult areas could be performed, and the machine converted into a canister-type cleaner with a long hose attached to the front for dusting tasks.
Starting with the Model 505, adjusting the carpet nozzle employed what Kirby called "Triple Cushioned Vibration Rug Cleaning Action".[5] This involved briefly lifting the carpet up off the floor with the significant suction created by the machine, thereby cushioning the area to be cleaned off of the floor, while the rotating vibrating brush separated the carpet fibers, thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating the carpet fibers. Earlier methods instructed that the carpet nozzle must maintain contact with the surface of the carpet, utilizing the suction, while later instruction manuals recommended the nozzle be slightly above with only the brush establishing contact and improving airflow around the surface being cleaned. For delicate surfaces, the drive belt that spins the brush can be detached so that only suction is used. When the Heritage Model was introduced in 1982, the Brush Performance Indicator Light was installed in the top of the carpet nozzle, which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush. A small LED bulb would light up when the brush was spinning; if the light appeared to blink or wasn't illuminated, it meant the brush wasn't rotating at the desired speed, and that the nozzle needed to be adjusted up or signifying that an inspection of the drive belt was needed.
Collection and disposal of the dirt has also changed over the years, but one component has remained, called the "Sani-Em-Tor".[5] This is a component attached to the discharge tube leading away from the vacuum turbine chamber where the suction is created. Earlier versions used a dense duvetyne, and later corduroy cotton fabric bag where the dirt, lint and other debris collected, allowing airflow to pass through and clean the air. The Sani Em-Tor trapped heavier material in the bottom, where a lid could be removed and the dirt disposed. The cotton bag also has an integrated cleaning pocket within, called the Sani-Pocket introduced in 1964 with the Sanitronic, where embedded dirt could be dislodged from the interior surface of the bag while keeping the dirt contained inside. Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, disposable paper bag was introduced optionally in addition to the cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. When the Generation 3 was introduced in 1990, the only method of dirt collection was the disposable paper bag, and was later labeled "Micron Magic" with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns.[5]
Versatility has also been a marketing feature, being able to configure the machine for various tasks. The attachments available have come and gone over the years, but some of the more popular ones remain available today. A floor buffer attachment and bare floor dusting pad were introduced with the Model 2C, along with a hand-held, paint spray gun and upholstery shampoo dispenser called the Suds-O-Gun, powered by attaching the hose to the turbine discharge tube have remained. A carpet shampoo attachment, called the Rug Renovator appeared with the Dual Sanitronic 50 in 1965.[5] Another unusual attachment, called the Handi-Butler introduced with the Model 516, used the turbine shaft at the front to power several devices, offered as convenience features that could sharpen knives, a cable could also be attached to a wire brush to remove rust from various surfaces, along with a lambs wool polishing disk, and a flannel buffing pad for more delicate tasks. The Handi-Butler was last offered with the Tradition model, and was replaced by the Turbo Sander with the Legend model.[5] The Turbo Sander was equipped with a small turbine inside the device, powered by the suction through the attachment hose, which can accommodate various grades of sand paper, scrubbing pads, and a soft, vinyl pad to be used as a massage unit that is still currently available.
During the mid-1970s, with the popularity of deep shag carpeting, a rake attachment called the Shag King,[5] was attached in front of the carpet nozzle to lift the fibers while cleaning the carpet, offered only on the Classic Omega, Classic III and the Tradition models. Another original attachment offered with the Model 2C, called the Crystalator, could be used to fumigate closets for insects and moths using moth balls, which was no longer available with the Legend Model in the late 1980s.
First Generation (1939-1969)[edit]

Model Names start with the 2C, followed by the 3C, 4C, 505 (introduction of Magic Finger Belt Lifter for Carpet Nozzle removal), 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 514, 516, 517, 518, 519, 560, 561, 562, Sanitronic VII, Dual Sanitronic 50 (introduction of two-speed motor for hose attachment and the Rug Renovator shampoo system), ending with the Dual Sanitronic 80.

Second Generation (1970-1989)[edit]

Model Names start with the Classic, followed with the Classic Omega, Classic III, Tradition (first introduction of disposable dust bag), Heritage, Heritage 2, Legend, ending with the Legend 2.

Third Generation (1990-present)[edit]

Model Names start with the Generation 3 (first introduction of TechDrive Power Assist), followed with the G4, G5, Gsix, G2000, G2001, Ultimate G, Ultimate G Diamond Edition, Sentria, Sentria II, ending with the Avalir.

Other units[edit]
Kirby ventured into small, portable, handheld units by reviving the Vacuette in the 1970s, then later producing the battery powered Split Second for small or light duty cleaning, which are powered by a 12V DC plug that runs in automobile cigarette lighters. In the 1980s, they also briefly offered a commercial model called the ComVac in three sizes, called the 1300, 1800 and the 2800. They were very basic and didn't come with the additional attachments or the shiny chrome appearance which are no longer sold.
Sales practice[edit]
Since 1920, new Kirby home care systems have only been sold through in-home demonstrations by independent, authorized Kirby distributors.[1] The Kirby Company manufactures the unit and sells it to a group of authorized distributors. Each distributor is an independent business, and as such sets their own price for the unit and conducts their own business operations. Independent distributors recruit dealers who are also independent contractors. The dealers sell the unit door-to-door and are generally compensated only through commission.[12]
Criticism of marketing and sales practices[edit]
The practices of some of Kirby's independent distributors have been subject to criticism. The Kirby is included by Lon L. Fuller and Melvin A. Eisenberg, Professors of Contract Law at Harvard Law School and UC Berkeley School of Law/Columbia Law School, as a textbook example of unconscionability.[13] Kirby has been subject to relentless criticism by consumer protection agencies.[3] As of 1999, of the 22 state consumer protection agencies, 15 had received a total of more than 600 complaints in just a few years.[3] Between 1996 and 1999, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection received 50 complaints regarding Kirby dealers, and concluded from its investigation that Kirby, through its distributors, engaged in a "statewide pattern of trade practices" violation of state consumer-protection laws.[3]
Many of the complaints involve "older customers who lack the will to stand up to grueling sales pitches."[3] The Wall Street Journal records examples where an elderly couple was unable to remove three Kirby salesmen from their home for over five hours; in another example, a disabled woman who had been living alone in a mobile home on $1000/month in Social Security payments and suffering from Alzheimer's disease was discovered to own two Kirby vacuum cleaners, having paid $1,700 for the second one.[3] In 2002, the Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner obtained $13,000 in refunds for 13 senior citizens.[14]
According to the Wall Street Journal, the device "costs more than four times what other top-of-the-line vacuum cleaners do."[3] Kirby compares the price difference to that between luxury and economy cars, yet "luxury-car dealers don't make house calls in trailer parks. But Kirby dealers do."[3] The Kirby vacuum cleaner is "marketed exclusively door-to-door — often to people who can ill afford a $1,500 gadget, but succumb to the sales pitch nonetheless."[3]
In 2001, the West Virginia Attorney General obtained more than $26,000 in refunds and credits for dissatisfied Kirby buyers.[14] In 2002, ABC's Primetime conducted a hidden-camera investigation in response to more than a thousand complaints regarding Kirby's salespeople.[14] In June 2004, the Arizona Attorney General filed suit against Kirby distributors for violations of the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, seeking an injunction against any other home sales.[14] Public authorities flooded with complaints about Kirby vacuum cleaners is not a recent phenomenon; even in the 1960s and 1970s, Kirby had been "cited by various agencies a number of times" and the Detroit Better Business Bureau had received so many complaints that it decided to turn the matter over to the Wayne County prosecutor.[15]
Kirby asserts it is not liable from actions of its sales force, whom it holds out as independent contractors.[3] Its "Distributor Code of Ethics" enumerates 12 principles, including "observe the highest standards of character, honesty and integrity in dealings with my customers, fellow Distributors and other members of the Kirby profession."[3] Kirby also teaches its distributors direct-sales laws, and requires them to resolve complaints within 24 hours under threat of termination.[3]
Litigation[edit]
Between 1998 and 2001, in Alabama alone, more than 100 lawsuits were filed against Kirby and its affiliates and subsidiaries, resulting in nearly $2 million in judgements and settlements.[16]
Twelve distributors of Kirby vacuums in Massachusetts were cited for violations of the Commonwealth's wage and hour laws by the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in July 2010. The 12 distributors were cited for a variety of different wage and hour violations including nonpayment of wage, nonpayment of minimum wage, misclassification, child labor, retaliation and record-keeping violations. The distributors were fined a total of $199,300 for the violations and also ordered to pay restitution.[17]
Sexual assault[edit]
The Supreme Court of Texas held Kirby liable for a rape committed by one of its door-to-door salesmen, finding that the manufacturer maintained control of its distributors and their salespeople, by requiring its distributors to make sales via in-home visits, and that the risk was foreseeable.[18] In that case, the court found that — had the employee's references been checked — Kirby would have discovered complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior at his previous employer and an arrest and deferred adjudication for indecency with a child.[19]
The North Dakota Supreme Court also held Kirby liable in a similar rape incident, where the salesman was hired after being convicted of assault and with charges of criminal sexual misconduct in the third degree pending against him.[20][21]
Fraud and RICO[edit]
A federal class-action lawsuit is pending against Kirby under the civil action provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), for allegedly selling used vacuums as new; the complaint alleges that "Not only is Kirby aware of this practice, it 'participates in the scheme by, among other things, selling to its distributors duplicate or replacement "Original Purchaser's Registration" cards to be given to secondhand purchasers.'"[22] The complaint also alleges that "Kirby commonly sells distributors new empty boxes and packaging material for the obvious purpose of repackaging units that the distributor previously sold to a prior customer."[23] Kirby's motion to dismiss was rejected.[22] After Kirby refused discovery requests for its sales contracts and other documents, Judge Clay D. Land compelled Kirby to disclose the requested documents.[24]
A class-action lawsuit was also filed against Kirby in Bullock County Court in Alabama over its sales practices, specifically its use of credit cards issued expressly to fund Kirby purchases, under Truth in Lending laws.[3] Kirby succeeded in persuading a trial judge to recuse himself.[25]
Actions against unauthorized dealers[edit]
Kirby has sued unauthorized Kirby vacuum dealers for United States trademark infringement where the vacuums are identified by the Kirby name and logo. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that such use does not constitute trademark infringement.[26][27] The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated an injunction granted in Kirby's favor by a lower court in that Circuit based on similar trademark claims against an unauthorized distributor.[28]
Kirby also did not prevail in a similar action against an unauthorized dealer in Minnesota, where it asserted trademark infringement, false and unfair competition, and trade disparagement; the authorized dealer prevailed on a $90,000 counterclaim against Kirby for defamation and then in a suit against an insurer who refused to defend the suit when the dealer refused Kirby's settlement offer.[29][30] Kirby's parent lost another such suit in Minnesota based on trademark infringement and other related state law claims.[31]
Nor did Kirby prevail in a tortious interference with contractual relations claim in Washington against an unauthorized retailer; the Washington Supreme Court awarded attorney's fees to the retailer.[32] However, Kirby has prevailed in cases where unauthorized retailers went farther than using the name and logo to identify the vacuum cleaner, misrepresenting themselves as the manufacturer and claiming the existence of factory warranty.[33]

History[edit]




Kirby Sentria Chrome Edition


The first Kirby vacuums were designed by James B. Kirby (1885–1971) for George Scott and Carl Fetzer after World War I, although the Kirby name was not used on a vacuum cleaner until the 1930s.[2] James Kirby invented the "vacuette" circa 1920, and their primary competitors were The Hoover Company and The Eureka Company which both began operations in 1909, and Bissell who originally built carpet sweepers beginning in 1876.[3]
The Vacuette Electric, introduced in 1925 with its removable floor nozzle and handle, became the forerunner of today's multi-attachment Kirby vacuum models. In 1935, the company introduced the Kirby Model C, the first product to carry Jim Kirby's name.[4] The Vacuette was also briefly offered without an electric motor, utilizing a spring-loaded worm gear driven by pulling the vacuum cleaner backwards, then when pushing the machine forward, the worm gear would power a turbine that provided the suction needed. It was designed for rural areas that didn't have electricity, and was very similar to the carpet sweeper.
While competitors have changed the orientation of the motor, their products appearance, materials used in construction and other features over the years, Kirby has remained with the original machines design, materials used and functionality with enhancements added to aide in its operation and durability. The company changes the appearance with revised color schemes and introduces new model names while keeping the core technology intact.[5]
In 1970, input from Kirby distributors, dealers, management and customers guided Kirby engineers in developing the Kirby Classic. This ushered in the second generation models, and was an instant success, with soaring sales, forcing the company to expand its manufacturing facilities outside of Cleveland for the first time. In 1972, Kirby West began operations in Andrews, Texas at 1345 NW 101 Street. The facility doubled the company's manufacturing capabilities.[4] The company did maintain a presence in Canada at 1009 Burns Street East in Whitby which is no longer staffed.
Berkshire Hathaway bought Kirby parent Scott Fetzer in 1986 for $315 million.[3] Two years prior, Ivan Boesky had offered to buy Scott Fetzer for $60 a share, or $420 million.[6] Warren Buffett has singled out Scott Fetzer to Berkshire's shareholders as the "prototype" for the "kind of company — and acquisition — he was interested in."[7] According to Berkshire managers, "absolutely no changes were made to the existing Scott Fetzer business or management, and the entire business (and its jet) was preserved."[8]
As of 2003, Kirby is the largest source of revenue and profit for Scott Fetzer, with approximately 500,000 sales per year, about a third of which are outside the United States.[9] In 2003, Scott Fetzer sold the vacuums to about 835 factory distributors, who in turn sell the vacuums door-to-door.[9] As an incentive to new customers, Kirby offers the Service Center Vacuum Rebuild Program for original owners who have been registered with the company. As long as the customer owns the machine as the registered owner, if the cleaner needs repair, they can send it back to the Rebuild Department and have it restored to “like new” condition. The company will completely disassemble it, repair or replace any worn Kirby parts, and sandblast, polish and buff metal parts back to a shiny “new” appearance. Internal components are also thoroughly inspected and repaired with Kirby replacement parts so that it will perform as originally designed.[10]
Kirby unit models[edit]




A Kirby G5 upright vacuum cleaner


The Kirby Company generally produces only one model at a time. Kirby's vacuums made until 1919 were made by Frantz Premier. Those made from 1919 to 1934 are branded and made by The Scott & Fetzer Company. After 1934 all machines have been made by Scott & Fetzer, though branded as Kirby.
From 1935 through the 1980s, continuous improvements and refinements were made to the Kirby home care system. One of the popular selling points is that it can be easily configured into a canister vacuum, hand portable vacuum, air pump, floor polisher, and more. It can also be converted into a shampoo system for carpets and a sweeping, dusting, and mopping system for bare floors. [11][4] The characteristic chrome appearance is due to the bulk of the machine is assembled from aluminum, a tradition going back to the very early days of manufacture.
Beginning in the 1990s, the Generation series ushered in a new platform for the cleaner. The addition of TechDrive variable power assist eliminated 90% of the effort required to move the unit back and forth.[4] The current model, the Avalir, continues the tradition that converts the vacuum into several different units beginning with the Model 508 in 1948. With most vacuum cleaner models, the rubber drive belt that powers the brush bar, an integral component with most modern machines, remains in place and is only examined when it breaks. Vacuum attachments are available on other machines but don't require the drive belt to be disconnected. Kirby attachments are connected to the power unit, and disconnecting the drive belt is usually involved in the process that add to its flexibility.[5]
One of the key procedures for using a Kirby Vacuum is the correct way to adjust the carpet nozzle for the best possible results. Starting with the 1939 Model 2C to the most current machine, the instruction manual states that the carpet nozzle should be gradually lowered into position with the Toe-Touch latch[5], incrementally adjusting the rug nozzle until the rotating vibrating brush establishes contact, and the sound of the motor changes indicating suction has been achieved. With the introduction of the Model 505, the power switch was relocated from the top of the handle to the motor itself, so the handle could be removed and the machine converted to a portable unit with a shoulder strap so that cleaning in difficult areas could be performed, and the machine converted into a canister-type cleaner with a long hose attached to the front for dusting tasks.
Starting with the Model 505, adjusting the carpet nozzle employed what Kirby called "Triple Cushioned Vibration Rug Cleaning Action".[5] This involved briefly lifting the carpet up off the floor with the significant suction created by the machine, thereby cushioning the area to be cleaned off of the floor, while the rotating vibrating brush separated the carpet fibers, thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating the carpet fibers. Earlier methods instructed that the carpet nozzle must maintain contact with the surface of the carpet, utilizing the suction, while later instruction manuals recommended the nozzle be slightly above with only the brush establishing contact and improving airflow around the surface being cleaned. For delicate surfaces, the drive belt that spins the brush can be detached so that only suction is used. When the Heritage Model was introduced in 1982, the Brush Performance Indicator Light was installed in the top of the carpet nozzle, which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush. A small LED bulb would light up when the brush was spinning; if the light appeared to blink or wasn't illuminated, it meant the brush wasn't rotating at the desired speed, and that the nozzle needed to be adjusted up or signifying that an inspection of the drive belt was needed.
Collection and disposal of the dirt has also changed over the years, but one component has remained, called the "Sani-Em-Tor".[5] This is a component attached to the discharge tube leading away from the vacuum turbine chamber where the suction is created. Earlier versions used a dense duvetyne, and later corduroy cotton fabric bag where the dirt, lint and other debris collected, allowing airflow to pass through and clean the air. The Sani Em-Tor trapped heavier material in the bottom, where a lid could be removed and the dirt disposed. The cotton bag also has an integrated cleaning pocket within, called the Sani-Pocket introduced in 1964 with the Sanitronic, where embedded dirt could be dislodged from the interior surface of the bag while keeping the dirt contained inside. Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, disposable paper bag was introduced optionally in addition to the cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. When the Generation 3 was introduced in 1990, the only method of dirt collection was the disposable paper bag, and was later labeled "Micron Magic" with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns.[5]
Versatility has also been a marketing feature, being able to configure the machine for various tasks. The attachments available have come and gone over the years, but some of the more popular ones remain available today. A floor buffer attachment and bare floor dusting pad were introduced with the Model 2C, along with a hand-held, paint spray gun and upholstery shampoo dispenser called the Suds-O-Gun, powered by attaching the hose to the turbine discharge tube have remained. A carpet shampoo attachment, called the Rug Renovator appeared with the Dual Sanitronic 50 in 1965.[5] Another unusual attachment, called the Handi-Butler introduced with the Model 516, used the turbine shaft at the front to power several devices, offered as convenience features that could sharpen knives, a cable could also be attached to a wire brush to remove rust from various surfaces, along with a lambs wool polishing disk, and a flannel buffing pad for more delicate tasks. The Handi-Butler was last offered with the Tradition model, and was replaced by the Turbo Sander with the Legend model.[5] The Turbo Sander was equipped with a small turbine inside the device, powered by the suction through the attachment hose, which can accommodate various grades of sand paper, scrubbing pads, and a soft, vinyl pad to be used as a massage unit that is still currently available.
During the mid-1970s, with the popularity of deep shag carpeting, a rake attachment called the Shag King,[5] was attached in front of the carpet nozzle to lift the fibers while cleaning the carpet, offered only on the Classic Omega, Classic III and the Tradition models. Another original attachment offered with the Model 2C, called the Crystalator, could be used to fumigate closets for insects and moths using moth balls, which was no longer available with the Legend Model in the late 1980s.
First Generation (1939-1969)[edit]

Model Names start with the 2C, followed by the 3C, 4C, 505 (introduction of Magic Finger Belt Lifter for Carpet Nozzle removal), 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 514, 516, 517, 518, 519, 560, 561, 562, Sanitronic VII, Dual Sanitronic 50 (introduction of two-speed motor for hose attachment and the Rug Renovator shampoo system), ending with the Dual Sanitronic 80.

Second Generation (1970-1989)[edit]

Model Names start with the Classic, followed with the Classic Omega, Classic III, Tradition (first introduction of disposable dust bag), Heritage, Heritage 2, Legend, ending with the Legend 2.

Third Generation (1990-present)[edit]

Model Names start with the Generation 3 (first introduction of TechDrive Power Assist), followed with the G4, G5, Gsix, G2000, G2001, Ultimate G, Ultimate G Diamond Edition, Sentria, Sentria II, ending with the Avalir.

Other units[edit]
Kirby ventured into small, portable, handheld units by reviving the Vacuette in the 1970s, then later producing the battery powered Split Second for small or light duty cleaning, which are powered by a 12V DC plug that runs in automobile cigarette lighters. In the 1980s, they also briefly offered a commercial model called the ComVac in three sizes, called the 1300, 1800 and the 2800. They were very basic and didn't come with the additional attachments or the shiny chrome appearance which are no longer sold.
Sales practice[edit]
Since 1920, new Kirby home care systems have only been sold through in-home demonstrations by independent, authorized Kirby distributors.[1] The Kirby Company manufactures the unit and sells it to a group of authorized distributors. Each distributor is an independent business, and as such sets their own price for the unit and conducts their own business operations. Independent distributors recruit dealers who are also independent contractors. The dealers sell the unit door-to-door and are generally compensated only through commission.[12]
Criticism of marketing and sales practices[edit]
The practices of some of Kirby's independent distributors have been subject to criticism. The Kirby is included by Lon L. Fuller and Melvin A. Eisenberg, Professors of Contract Law at Harvard Law School and UC Berkeley School of Law/Columbia Law School, as a textbook example of unconscionability.[13] Kirby has been subject to relentless criticism by consumer protection agencies.[3] As of 1999, of the 22 state consumer protection agencies, 15 had received a total of more than 600 complaints in just a few years.[3] Between 1996 and 1999, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection received 50 complaints regarding Kirby dealers, and concluded from its investigation that Kirby, through its distributors, engaged in a "statewide pattern of trade practices" violation of state consumer-protection laws.[3]
Many of the complaints involve "older customers who lack the will to stand up to grueling sales pitches."[3] The Wall Street Journal records examples where an elderly couple was unable to remove three Kirby salesmen from their home for over five hours; in another example, a disabled woman who had been living alone in a mobile home on $1000/month in Social Security payments and suffering from Alzheimer's disease was discovered to own two Kirby vacuum cleaners, having paid $1,700 for the second one.[3] In 2002, the Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner obtained $13,000 in refunds for 13 senior citizens.[14]
According to the Wall Street Journal, the device "costs more than four times what other top-of-the-line vacuum cleaners do."[3] Kirby compares the price difference to that between luxury and economy cars, yet "luxury-car dealers don't make house calls in trailer parks. But Kirby dealers do."[3] The Kirby vacuum cleaner is "marketed exclusively door-to-door — often to people who can ill afford a $1,500 gadget, but succumb to the sales pitch nonetheless."[3]
In 2001, the West Virginia Attorney General obtained more than $26,000 in refunds and credits for dissatisfied Kirby buyers.[14] In 2002, ABC's Primetime conducted a hidden-camera investigation in response to more than a thousand complaints regarding Kirby's salespeople.[14] In June 2004, the Arizona Attorney General filed suit against Kirby distributors for violations of the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, seeking an injunction against any other home sales.[14] Public authorities flooded with complaints about Kirby vacuum cleaners is not a recent phenomenon; even in the 1960s and 1970s, Kirby had been "cited by various agencies a number of times" and the Detroit Better Business Bureau had received so many complaints that it decided to turn the matter over to the Wayne County prosecutor.[15]
Kirby asserts it is not liable from actions of its sales force, whom it holds out as independent contractors.[3] Its "Distributor Code of Ethics" enumerates 12 principles, including "observe the highest standards of character, honesty and integrity in dealings with my customers, fellow Distributors and other members of the Kirby profession."[3] Kirby also teaches its distributors direct-sales laws, and requires them to resolve complaints within 24 hours under threat of termination.[3]
Litigation[edit]
Between 1998 and 2001, in Alabama alone, more than 100 lawsuits were filed against Kirby and its affiliates and subsidiaries, resulting in nearly $2 million in judgements and settlements.[16]
Twelve distributors of Kirby vacuums in Massachusetts were cited for violations of the Commonwealth's wage and hour laws by the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in July 2010. The 12 distributors were cited for a variety of different wage and hour violations including nonpayment of wage, nonpayment of minimum wage, misclassification, child labor, retaliation and record-keeping violations. The distributors were fined a total of $199,300 for the violations and also ordered to pay restitution.[17]
Sexual assault[edit]
The Supreme Court of Texas held Kirby liable for a rape committed by one of its door-to-door salesmen, finding that the manufacturer maintained control of its distributors and their salespeople, by requiring its distributors to make sales via in-home visits, and that the risk was foreseeable.[18] In that case, the court found that — had the employee's references been checked — Kirby would have discovered complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior at his previous employer and an arrest and deferred adjudication for indecency with a child.[19]
The North Dakota Supreme Court also held Kirby liable in a similar rape incident, where the salesman was hired after being convicted of assault and with charges of criminal sexual misconduct in the third degree pending against him.[20][21]
Fraud and RICO[edit]
A federal class-action lawsuit is pending against Kirby under the civil action provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), for allegedly selling used vacuums as new; the complaint alleges that "Not only is Kirby aware of this practice, it 'participates in the scheme by, among other things, selling to its distributors duplicate or replacement "Original Purchaser's Registration" cards to be given to secondhand purchasers.'"[22] The complaint also alleges that "Kirby commonly sells distributors new empty boxes and packaging material for the obvious purpose of repackaging units that the distributor previously sold to a prior customer."[23] Kirby's motion to dismiss was rejected.[22] After Kirby refused discovery requests for its sales contracts and other documents, Judge Clay D. Land compelled Kirby to disclose the requested documents.[24]
A class-action lawsuit was also filed against Kirby in Bullock County Court in Alabama over its sales practices, specifically its use of credit cards issued expressly to fund Kirby purchases, under Truth in Lending laws.[3] Kirby succeeded in persuading a trial judge to recuse himself.[25]
Actions against unauthorized dealers[edit]
Kirby has sued unauthorized Kirby vacuum dealers for United States trademark infringement where the vacuums are identified by the Kirby name and logo. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that such use does not constitute trademark infringement.[26][27] The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated an injunction granted in Kirby's favor by a lower court in that Circuit based on similar trademark claims against an unauthorized distributor.[28]
Kirby also did not prevail in a similar action against an unauthorized dealer in Minnesota, where it asserted trademark infringement, false and unfair competition, and trade disparagement; the authorized dealer prevailed on a $90,000 counterclaim against Kirby for defamation and then in a suit against an insurer who refused to defend the suit when the dealer refused Kirby's settlement offer.[29][30] Kirby's parent lost another such suit in Minnesota based on trademark infringement and other related state law claims.[31]
Nor did Kirby prevail in a tortious interference with contractual relations claim in Washington against an unauthorized retailer; the Washington Supreme Court awarded attorney's fees to the retailer.[32] However, Kirby has prevailed in cases where unauthorized retailers went farther than using the name and logo to identify the vacuum cleaner, misrepresenting themselves as the manufacturer and claiming the existence of factory warranty.[33]

History[edit]




Kirby Sentria Chrome Edition


The first Kirby vacuums were designed by James B. Kirby (1885–1971) for George Scott and Carl Fetzer after World War I, although the Kirby name was not used on a vacuum cleaner until the 1930s.[2] James Kirby invented the "vacuette" circa 1920, and their primary competitors were The Hoover Company and The Eureka Company which both began operations in 1909, and Bissell who originally built carpet sweepers beginning in 1876.[3]
The Vacuette Electric, introduced in 1925 with its removable floor nozzle and handle, became the forerunner of today's multi-attachment Kirby vacuum models. In 1935, the company introduced the Kirby Model C, the first product to carry Jim Kirby's name.[4] The Vacuette was also briefly offered without an electric motor, utilizing a spring-loaded worm gear driven by pulling the vacuum cleaner backwards, then when pushing the machine forward, the worm gear would power a turbine that provided the suction needed. It was designed for rural areas that didn't have electricity, and was very similar to the carpet sweeper.
While competitors have changed the orientation of the motor, their products appearance, materials used in construction and other features over the years, Kirby has remained with the original machines design, materials used and functionality with enhancements added to aide in its operation and durability. The company changes the appearance with revised color schemes and introduces new model names while keeping the core technology intact.[5]
In 1970, input from Kirby distributors, dealers, management and customers guided Kirby engineers in developing the Kirby Classic. This ushered in the second generation models, and was an instant success, with soaring sales, forcing the company to expand its manufacturing facilities outside of Cleveland for the first time. In 1972, Kirby West began operations in Andrews, Texas at 1345 NW 101 Street. The facility doubled the company's manufacturing capabilities.[4] The company did maintain a presence in Canada at 1009 Burns Street East in Whitby which is no longer staffed.
Berkshire Hathaway bought Kirby parent Scott Fetzer in 1986 for $315 million.[3] Two years prior, Ivan Boesky had offered to buy Scott Fetzer for $60 a share, or $420 million.[6] Warren Buffett has singled out Scott Fetzer to Berkshire's shareholders as the "prototype" for the "kind of company — and acquisition — he was interested in."[7] According to Berkshire managers, "absolutely no changes were made to the existing Scott Fetzer business or management, and the entire business (and its jet) was preserved."[8]
As of 2003, Kirby is the largest source of revenue and profit for Scott Fetzer, with approximately 500,000 sales per year, about a third of which are outside the United States.[9] In 2003, Scott Fetzer sold the vacuums to about 835 factory distributors, who in turn sell the vacuums door-to-door.[9] As an incentive to new customers, Kirby offers the Service Center Vacuum Rebuild Program for original owners who have been registered with the company. As long as the customer owns the machine as the registered owner, if the cleaner needs repair, they can send it back to the Rebuild Department and have it restored to “like new” condition. The company will completely disassemble it, repair or replace any worn Kirby parts, and sandblast, polish and buff metal parts back to a shiny “new” appearance. Internal components are also thoroughly inspected and repaired with Kirby replacement parts so that it will perform as originally designed.[10]
Kirby unit models[edit]

The Kirby Company generally produces only one model at a time. Kirby's vacuums made until 1919 were made by Frantz Premier. Those made from 1919 to 1934 are branded and made by The Scott & Fetzer Company. After 1934 all machines have been made by Scott & Fetzer, though branded as Kirby.
From 1935 through the 1980s, continuous improvements and refinements were made to the Kirby home care system. One of the popular selling points is that it can be easily configured into a canister vacuum, hand portable vacuum, air pump, floor polisher, and more. It can also be converted into a shampoo system for carpets and a sweeping, dusting, and mopping system for bare floors. [11][4] The characteristic chrome appearance is due to the bulk of the machine is assembled from aluminum, a tradition going back to the very early days of manufacture.
Beginning in the 1990s, the Generation series ushered in a new platform for the cleaner. The addition of TechDrive variable power assist eliminated 90% of the effort required to move the unit back and forth.[4] The current model, the Avalir, continues the tradition that converts the vacuum into several different units beginning with the Model 508 in 1948. With most vacuum cleaner models, the rubber drive belt that powers the brush bar, an integral component with most modern machines, remains in place and is only examined when it breaks. Vacuum attachments are available on other machines but don't require the drive belt to be disconnected. Kirby attachments are connected to the power unit, and disconnecting the drive belt is usually involved in the process that add to its flexibility.[5]
One of the key procedures for using a Kirby Vacuum is the correct way to adjust the carpet nozzle for the best possible results. Starting with the 1939 Model 2C to the most current machine, the instruction manual states that the carpet nozzle should be gradually lowered into position with the Toe-Touch latch[5], incrementally adjusting the rug nozzle until the rotating vibrating brush establishes contact, and the sound of the motor changes indicating suction has been achieved. With the introduction of the Model 505, the power switch was relocated from the top of the handle to the motor itself, so the handle could be removed and the machine converted to a portable unit with a shoulder strap so that cleaning in difficult areas could be performed, and the machine converted into a canister-type cleaner with a long hose attached to the front for dusting tasks.
Starting with the Model 505, adjusting the carpet nozzle employed what Kirby called "Triple Cushioned Vibration Rug Cleaning Action".[5] This involved briefly lifting the carpet up off the floor with the significant suction created by the machine, thereby cushioning the area to be cleaned off of the floor, while the rotating vibrating brush separated the carpet fibers, thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating the carpet fibers. Earlier methods instructed that the carpet nozzle must maintain contact with the surface of the carpet, utilizing the suction, while later instruction manuals recommended the nozzle be slightly above with only the brush establishing contact and improving airflow around the surface being cleaned. For delicate surfaces, the drive belt that spins the brush can be detached so that only suction is used. When the Heritage Model was introduced in 1982, the Brush Performance Indicator Light was installed in the top of the carpet nozzle, which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush. A small LED bulb would light up when the brush was spinning; if the light appeared to blink or wasn't illuminated, it meant the brush wasn't rotating at the desired speed, and that the nozzle needed to be adjusted up or signifying that an inspection of the drive belt was needed.
Collection and disposal of the dirt has also changed over the years, but one component has remained, called the "Sani-Em-Tor".[5] This is a component attached to the discharge tube leading away from the vacuum turbine chamber where the suction is created. Earlier versions used a dense duvetyne, and later corduroy cotton fabric bag where the dirt, lint and other debris collected, allowing airflow to pass through and clean the air. The Sani Em-Tor trapped heavier material in the bottom, where a lid could be removed and the dirt disposed. The cotton bag also has an integrated cleaning pocket within, called the Sani-Pocket introduced in 1964 with the Sanitronic, where embedded dirt could be dislodged from the interior surface of the bag while keeping the dirt contained inside. Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, disposable paper bag was introduced optionally in addition to the cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. When the Generation 3 was introduced in 1990, the only method of dirt collection was the disposable paper bag, and was later labeled "Micron Magic" with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns.[5]
Versatility has also been a marketing feature, being able to configure the machine for various tasks. The attachments available have come and gone over the years, but some of the more popular ones remain available today. A floor buffer attachment and bare floor dusting pad were introduced with the Model 2C, along with a hand-held, paint spray gun and upholstery shampoo dispenser called the Suds-O-Gun, powered by attaching the hose to the turbine discharge tube have remained. A carpet shampoo attachment, called the Rug Renovator appeared with the Dual Sanitronic 50 in 1965.[5] Another unusual attachment, called the Handi-Butler introduced with the Model 516, used the turbine shaft at the front to power several devices, offered as convenience features that could sharpen knives, a cable could also be attached to a wire brush to remove rust from various surfaces, along with a lambs wool polishing disk, and a flannel buffing pad for more delicate tasks. The Handi-Butler was last offered with the Tradition model, and was replaced by the Turbo Sander with the Legend model.[5] The Turbo Sander was equipped with a small turbine inside the device, powered by the suction through the attachment hose, which can accommodate various grades of sand paper, scrubbing pads, and a soft, vinyl pad to be used as a massage unit that is still currently available.
During the mid-1970s, with the popularity of deep shag carpeting, a rake attachment called the Shag King,[5] was attached in front of the carpet nozzle to lift the fibers while cleaning the carpet, offered only on the Classic Omega, Classic III and the Tradition models. Another original attachment offered with the Model 2C, called the Crystalator, could be used to fumigate closets for insects and moths using moth balls, which was no longer available with the Legend Model in the late 1980s.
First Generation (1939-1969)[edit]

Model Names start with the 2C, followed by the 3C, 4C, 505 (introduction of Magic Finger Belt Lifter for Carpet Nozzle removal), 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 514, 516, 517, 518, 519, 560, 561, 562, Sanitronic VII, Dual Sanitronic 50 (introduction of two-speed motor for hose attachment and the Rug Renovator shampoo system), ending with the Dual Sanitronic 80.

Second Generation (1970-1989)[edit]

Model Names start with the Classic, followed with the Classic Omega, Classic III, Tradition (first introduction of disposable dust bag), Heritage, Heritage 2, Legend, ending with the Legend 2.

Third Generation (1990-present)[edit]

Model Names start with the Generation 3 (first introduction of TechDrive Power Assist), followed with the G4, G5, Gsix, G2000, G2001, Ultimate G, Ultimate G Diamond Edition, Sentria, Sentria II, ending with the Avalir.

Other units[edit]
Kirby ventured into small, portable, handheld units by reviving the Vacuette in the 1970s, then later producing the battery powered Split Second for small or light duty cleaning, which are powered by a 12V DC plug that runs in automobile cigarette lighters. In the 1980s, they also briefly offered a commercial model called the ComVac in three sizes, called the 1300, 1800 and the 2800. They were very basic and didn't come with the additional attachments or the shiny chrome appearance which are no longer sold.
Sales practice[edit]
Since 1920, new Kirby home care systems have only been sold through in-home demonstrations by independent, authorized Kirby distributors.[1] The Kirby Company manufactures the unit and sells it to a group of authorized distributors. Each distributor is an independent business, and as such sets their own price for the unit and conducts their own business operations. Independent distributors recruit dealers who are also independent contractors. The dealers sell the unit door-to-door and are generally compensated only through commission.[12]
Criticism of marketing and sales practices[edit]
The practices of some of Kirby's independent distributors have been subject to criticism. The Kirby is included by Lon L. Fuller and Melvin A. Eisenberg, Professors of Contract Law at Harvard Law School and UC Berkeley School of Law/Columbia Law School, as a textbook example of unconscionability.[13] Kirby has been subject to relentless criticism by consumer protection agencies.[3] As of 1999, of the 22 state consumer protection agencies, 15 had received a total of more than 600 complaints in just a few years.[3] Between 1996 and 1999, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection received 50 complaints regarding Kirby dealers, and concluded from its investigation that Kirby, through its distributors, engaged in a "statewide pattern of trade practices" violation of state consumer-protection laws.[3]
Many of the complaints involve "older customers who lack the will to stand up to grueling sales pitches."[3] The Wall Street Journal records examples where an elderly couple was unable to remove three Kirby salesmen from their home for over five hours; in another example, a disabled woman who had been living alone in a mobile home on $1000/month in Social Security payments and suffering from Alzheimer's disease was discovered to own two Kirby vacuum cleaners, having paid $1,700 for the second one.[3] In 2002, the Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner obtained $13,000 in refunds for 13 senior citizens.[14]
According to the Wall Street Journal, the device "costs more than four times what other top-of-the-line vacuum cleaners do."[3] Kirby compares the price difference to that between luxury and economy cars, yet "luxury-car dealers don't make house calls in trailer parks. But Kirby dealers do."[3] The Kirby vacuum cleaner is "marketed exclusively door-to-door — often to people who can ill afford a $1,500 gadget, but succumb to the sales pitch nonetheless."[3]
In 2001, the West Virginia Attorney General obtained more than $26,000 in refunds and credits for dissatisfied Kirby buyers.[14] In 2002, ABC's Primetime conducted a hidden-camera investigation in response to more than a thousand complaints regarding Kirby's salespeople.[14] In June 2004, the Arizona Attorney General filed suit against Kirby distributors for violations of the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, seeking an injunction against any other home sales.[14] Public authorities flooded with complaints about Kirby vacuum cleaners is not a recent phenomenon; even in the 1960s and 1970s, Kirby had been "cited by various agencies a number of times" and the Detroit Better Business Bureau had received so many complaints that it decided to turn the matter over to the Wayne County prosecutor.[15]
Kirby asserts it is not liable from actions of its sales force, whom it holds out as independent contractors.[3] Its "Distributor Code of Ethics" enumerates 12 principles, including "observe the highest standards of character, honesty and integrity in dealings with my customers, fellow Distributors and other members of the Kirby profession."[3] Kirby also teaches its distributors direct-sales laws, and requires them to resolve complaints within 24 hours under threat of termination.[3]
Litigation[edit]
Between 1998 and 2001, in Alabama alone, more than 100 lawsuits were filed against Kirby and its affiliates and subsidiaries, resulting in nearly $2 million in judgements and settlements.[16]
Twelve distributors of Kirby vacuums in Massachusetts were cited for violations of the Commonwealth's wage and hour laws by the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in July 2010. The 12 distributors were cited for a variety of different wage and hour violations including nonpayment of wage, nonpayment of minimum wage, misclassification, child labor, retaliation and record-keeping violations. The distributors were fined a total of $199,300 for the violations and also ordered to pay restitution.[17]
Sexual assault[edit]
The Supreme Court of Texas held Kirby liable for a rape committed by one of its door-to-door salesmen, finding that the manufacturer maintained control of its distributors and their salespeople, by requiring its distributors to make sales via in-home visits, and that the risk was foreseeable.[18] In that case, the court found that — had the employee's references been checked — Kirby would have discovered complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior at his previous employer and an arrest and deferred adjudication for indecency with a child.[19]
The North Dakota Supreme Court also held Kirby liable in a similar rape incident, where the salesman was hired after being convicted of assault and with charges of criminal sexual misconduct in the third degree pending against him.[20][21]
Fraud and RICO[edit]
A federal class-action lawsuit is pending against Kirby under the civil action provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), for allegedly selling used vacuums as new; the complaint alleges that "Not only is Kirby aware of this practice, it 'participates in the scheme by, among other things, selling to its distributors duplicate or replacement "Original Purchaser's Registration" cards to be given to secondhand purchasers.'"[22] The complaint also alleges that "Kirby commonly sells distributors new empty boxes and packaging material for the obvious purpose of repackaging units that the distributor previously sold to a prior customer."[23] Kirby's motion to dismiss was rejected.[22] After Kirby refused discovery requests for its sales contracts and other documents, Judge Clay D. Land compelled Kirby to disclose the requested documents.[24]
A class-action lawsuit was also filed against Kirby in Bullock County Court in Alabama over its sales practices, specifically its use of credit cards issued expressly to fund Kirby purchases, under Truth in Lending laws.[3] Kirby succeeded in persuading a trial judge to recuse himself.[25]
Actions against unauthorized dealers[edit]
Kirby has sued unauthorized Kirby vacuum dealers for United States trademark infringement where the vacuums are identified by the Kirby name and logo. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that such use does not constitute trademark infringement.[26][27] The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated an injunction granted in Kirby's favor by a lower court in that Circuit based on similar trademark claims against an unauthorized distributor.[28]
Kirby also did not prevail in a similar action against an unauthorized dealer in Minnesota, where it asserted trademark infringement, false and unfair competition, and trade disparagement; the authorized dealer prevailed on a $90,000 counterclaim against Kirby for defamation and then in a suit against an insurer who refused to defend the suit when the dealer refused Kirby's settlement offer.[29][30] Kirby's parent lost another such suit in Minnesota based on trademark infringement and other related state law claims.[31]
Nor did Kirby prevail in a tortious interference with contractual relations claim in Washington against an unauthorized retailer; the Washington Supreme Court awarded attorney's fees to the retailer.[32] However, Kirby has prevailed in cases where unauthorized retailers went farther than using the name and logo to identify the vacuum cleaner, misrepresenting themselves as the manufacturer and claiming the existence of factory warranty.[33]

Kirby Offshore Marine
The Nation's Largest Offshore Tank Barge Fleet















Kirby Offshore Marine is the largest United States operator of coastal tank barges and towing vessels participating in the regional distribution of refined petroleum products, black oil and crude oil, as well as the distribution of petrochemicals between Petroleum Administration and Defense Districts.Kirby Offshore Marine placed orders in 2014 and 2015 for the construction of four new, state-of-the-art, coastal articulated tank barge and tugboat units (ATBs). The launching of the first ATB, the Kirby 185-01, built by Gunderson Shipyard in Portland, OR, can be viewed here. The Kirby 185-01 was placed in service in late 2015. The second new ATB, the Kirby 185-02, was placed in service in June 2016. The Kirby 155-01 was placed in service in November 2016 and the Kirby 155-02 will be delivered in the summer of 2017.Atlantic DivisionThe Atlantic Division’s primary business is the transportation of petroleum products between ports along the eastern seaboard of the United States. Vessels assigned to this division call on every coastal state from New England to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, servicing refineries, storage terminals and power plants. The Atlantic Division also operates equipment in the Caribbean and the Eastern Canadian provinces. The tank barges in the Atlantic Division are among Kirby’s largest, ranging in capacity from 10,000 barrels to 194,000 barrels and coastal tugboats from 1800 to 10000 horsepower. The majority of the Atlantic Division’s vessels are Articulated Tug/Barge units (ATBs). These units employ large hydraulic or pneumatically-operated pins to connect the tugboat and barge, enabling the tugboat to push, rather than pull the barge at sea. ATBs can operate safely and efficiently in a wider range of sea conditions than conventional tugboat and barge units, resulting in faster transit times, better fuel economy and fewer operating delays.The Atlantic Division also overseas the operations of two offshore tugboat and barge units that move sugar from Florida to various locations along the Eastern Seaboard.Atlantic Division – New York HarborThe New York Harbor operations in the Atlantic Division encompass tank barges ranging in capacity from 1,800 barrels to 81,000 barrels, and tugboats from 400 to 3400 horsepower. The operations in New York Harbor service a wide variety of customers in both the refined and residual petroleum trades. Many of the barges in the New York fleet are engaged in the delivery of bunker fuel to ships. New York Harbor vessels also transport gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, ethanol and other refined products for local and regional customers. In the residual fuel sector, power generating customers rely on New York Harbor vessels for floating storage and transportation of heavy fuel oil to local power plants.Pacific DivisionThe Pacific Division fleet consists of tank barges ranging in capacity from 26,000 barrels to 194,000 barrels, and tugboats from 2000 to 11000 horsepower. Pacific Division vessels trade from San Diego, CA to Barrow, AK. With extensive experience and a broad support network in Alaska, Kirby Offshore Marine’s Pacific Division is uniquely qualified to operate in remote areas including Dutch Harbor, Cook Inlet and the Alaska river systems.The Hawaii operations are also part of the Pacific Division.  Kirby Offshore Marine operates a fleet of several double-hulled tank barges in Hawaii under charter to utilities, local petroleum retailers and major oil companies, distributing heavy fuel oil and refined products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. These barges and their accompanying tugboats form a critical supply link to power generating plants and storage and distribution terminals throughout the Hawaiian Islands that cannot be replaced by other modes of transportation. The Hawaii Division tank barge fleet also provides bunkering service in Honolulu harbor and surrounding anchorages, and supplies transportation services to remote island locations in the central Pacific. Several vessels in the Hawaii provide contracted support services to a Single Point Mooring installation at Barbers Point, Oahu. This facility provides the means for large tankers to safely load and discharge their cargoes through an offshore buoy and submerged pipeline without entering a port.Inland Marine  Offshore Marine  Ocean Transport  Osprey Line  Logistics Management

Kirby Corporation
Putting America's Waterways to Work















In the Marine Transportation segment, Kirby is primarily a provider of transportation services by tank barge for inland and coastal markets.In the inland market, Kirby operates on the U.S. inland waterway system, which is composed of a network of interconnected rivers and canals that serve the nation as water highways and is one of the world’s most efficient transportation systems. The inland waterway system extends approximately 26,000 miles, 12,000 miles of which are generally considered significant for domestic commerce, through 38 states, with 635 shallow draft ports. The inland tank barge industry provides marine transportation of bulk liquid cargoes for customers throughout this marine highway system, including on the Mississippi River, its tributaries and on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The most significant markets in this industry include the transportation of petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products, and agricultural chemicals. Kirby’s inland tank barges carry all of these products.   The U.S. coastal system consists of ports along the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts, as well as ports in Alaska, Hawaii and on the Great Lakes. The coastal trade is also vital to the U.S. cargo distribution system, particularly the regional distribution of refined petroleum products from refineries and storage facilities to other refineries, distribution terminals, power plants and ships.  In addition, coastal tank barges are used frequently to distribute products from pipelines. Smaller volumes of petrochemicals are distributed from Gulf Coast plants to end users and black oil, including crude oil and natural gas condensate, is distributed regionally from refineries and terminals along the United States coast to refineries, power plants and distribution terminals. In addition, Kirby operates five offshore barge and tugboat units which carry coal from the Mississippi River to Florida and limestone rock out of Florida on return trips, as well as bulk sugar from Florida to various sugar refining facilities along the Eastern Seaboard.Customers:View Kirby Inland and Offshore Barge InformationView Kirby Inland and Offshore Boat SpecificationsInteractive Map of New York State Petroleum Business Tax ZonesInland Marine  Offshore Marine  Ocean Transport  Osprey Line  Logistics Management

                Michael Hart            








 



Houston-based Kirby Corp. (NYSE: KEX) announced June 13 it will acquire Stewart & Stevenson LLC, a subsidiary of Houston-based Parman Capital Group, for about $710 million.
The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, subject to regulatory approvals under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary conditions. Kirby plans to split the acquisition cost equally between the company’s revolving credit facility and about $355 million worth of Kirby common stock.

Michael Hart










 


Stewart & Stevenson is a privately held manufacturer and distributor of products and services for the oil and gas, marine, construction, power generation, transportation, mining and agricultural industries. It was the 43rd-largest for-profit private employer in the Houston area last year, based on its total local employment of 480 people, according to Houston Business Journal research.




Kirby is a major tank barge operator that transports bulk liquid products, including petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals. It also operates offshore dry-bulk barge and tugboat units and a diesel-engine services segment. It ranked No. 54 on HBJ's 2016 Largest Houston-based Public Companies List, based on its 2015 revenue of nearly $2.15 billion. Its 2016 revenue dropped about 17.5 percent to $1.77 billion.




 


The deal is expected to “accelerate diversification of (the companies’) combined product lines, boost facility utilization and improve productivity,” David Grzebinski, Kirby's president and CEO, said in a press release. The companies expect the acquisition to create synergies of $25 million in the first two years, according to a June 13 presentation about the deal.
"The acquisition of Stewart & Stevenson significantly expands the geographic footprint and capabilities of our distribution and services business,” Grzebinski said in the release. “This transaction creates one of the largest distribution networks in the country with the engineering and technological capacity to successfully address the complex requirements of a large customer base in a competitive national and global environment.”
The initial announcement did not include the firms that advised Kirby, Parman or Stewart & Stevenson in the deal.

HOUSTON, April 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Kirby Corporation ("Kirby") (NYSE:    KEX) today announced net earnings attributable to Kirby for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $27.5 million, or $0.51 per share, compared with $38.1 million, or $0.71 per share, for the 2016 first quarter.  Consolidated revenues for the 2017 first quarter were $491.7 million compared with $458.7 million reported for the 2016 first quarter.








David Grzebinski, Kirby's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations.  In our inland marine transportation market, barge utilization was in the high 80% to low 90% range for the quarter.  Utilization was affected by operating restrictions caused by poor, but seasonally normal weather conditions, and stronger utilization in our black oil fleet primarily as a result of turnarounds and seasonal factors affecting the U.S. Gulf Coast refining complex.  In the coastal marine transportation market, tank barge utilization was in the mid-70% to low 80% range during the first quarter as the market continued to be impacted by barges moving from term contracts into the spot market.  In response to continued difficult coastal market dynamics, we have taken measures to cut costs, reducing headcounts and temporarily taking barges out of service until market conditions improve."
Mr. Grzebinski continued, "Within our diesel engine services segment, the land-based market continued to experience strong demand for remanufacturing of pressure pumping units and transmission overhauls.  There was also a modest improvement during the quarter in the demand for the manufacture of new pressure pumping units and the sale of new transmissions.  In the marine diesel engine services market, revenues were down year-over-year, but operating profit increased as a result of cost control measures implemented in 2016.  In the power generation market, demand was comparable to the 2016 first quarter."
Segment Results – Marine TransportationMarine transportation revenues for the 2017 first quarter were $343.7 million compared with $378.3 million for the 2016 first quarter.  Operating income for the 2017 first quarter was $35.3 million compared with $69.8 million for the 2016 first quarter.
Demand for inland tank barge transportation of petrochemicals, refined petroleum products, and agricultural chemicals was stable, while black oil and pressure barge demand was higher sequentially.  Kirby's inland tank barge utilization was in the high 80% to low 90% range during the quarter.  Both term and spot contract pricing were at lower levels relative to the first quarter of 2016, although spot pricing remained stable compared to the 2016 fourth quarter.  Operating conditions during the quarter were seasonally normal, including periodic wind and fog which increased delay days and, consequently, reduced our efficiency on work performed under affreightment contracts.  The operating margin for the inland business was in the mid-teens.  
In the coastal marine transportation market, demand for the transportation of black oil, petrochemicals, and dry products was stable.  Demand for the transportation of refined petroleum products and crude oil was lower than the 2016 first quarter, and reflected general and seasonal weakness in the Northeast and Alaska.  The growing number of vessels trading in the spot market continued to drive increased idle time and voyage costs.  Utilization for the coastal tank barge fleet was in the mid-70% to low 80% range.  Additionally, coastal marine results were negatively impacted by customer requested acceleration of regulatory shipyards on two large units during the quarter.  The operating margin for the coastal marine business was in the negative mid-single digits. 
The marine transportation segment's 2017 first quarter operating margin was 10.3% compared with 18.4% for the first quarter of 2016 as a result of weaker pricing in the inland marine market and increased idle time in the coastal market as more barges operated in the spot market.  
Segment Results – Diesel Engine ServicesDiesel engine services revenues for the 2017 first quarter were $148.1 million with operating income of $13.7 million, compared with 2016 first quarter revenues of $80.4 million and an operating loss of $0.8 million. 
The higher revenues and operating income as compared to the first quarter of 2016 were due to elevated demand for the remanufacturing of pressure pumping units, rebuilt transmissions, and a modest uptick in the sale of new pressure pumping units.  In our marine diesel engine services business, revenues declined compared to the 2016 first quarter due to customer deferrals of major overhauls, particularly in the Midwest, and weak demand for new engines.  Gulf Coast oilfield services activity remained slow.  However, cost controls implemented in the marine diesel engine services business last year contributed to an increase in operating income relative to the 2016 first quarter.  Demand in the power generation market remained stable for the quarter, both sequentially and compared to the 2016 first quarter.  
The diesel engine services operating margin was 9.3% for the 2017 first quarter compared with (1.0)% for the 2016 first quarter due primarily to increased activity in our land-based diesel engine services market and improved efficiency in our marine diesel engine services business.
Cash GenerationEBITDA of $93.5 million for the 2017 first quarter compares with EBITDA of $113.8 million for the 2016 first quarter.  Cash flow was used to fund capital expenditures of $45.8 million, including $3.8 million for new inland tank barge and towboat construction, $15.2 million for progress payments on the construction of a new coastal articulated tank barge and tugboat unit ("ATB"), two 4900 horsepower coastal tugboats and six 5000 horsepower coastal ATB tugboats, final costs of $2.2 million on a 35,000 barrel coastal petrochemical tank barge delivered in December 2016, and $24.6 million primarily for upgrades to the existing inland and coastal fleets.  Total debt as of March 31, 2017 was $674.6 million and Kirby's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 21.7%.
OutlookCommenting on the 2017 second quarter and full year market outlook and guidance, Mr.  Grzebinski said, "Our earnings guidance for the 2017 second quarter is $0.40 to $0.55 per share compared with $0.72 per share for the 2016 second quarter.  Our full year earnings guidance remains $1.70 to $2.20 per share.  Second quarter and full year guidance contemplates inland marine transportation utilization in the mid-80% range at the low end and low 90% range at the high end.  We believe tank barge retirements will continue in response to the weak pricing environment in the inland market, further closing the gap between tank barge supply and demand.  At the middle to high end of our full year guidance we have accounted for a modest improvement in pricing in the second half of the year.  In our coastal market, we expect utilization in the mid-70% to low 80% range for the second quarter and full year. The cost reduction measures taken in the 2017 first quarter and early second quarter should allow us to operate at quarterly breakeven operating margins or a slight operating loss for the rest of the year."
Mr. Grzebinski continued, "In our diesel engine services markets, we anticipate pressure pumping remanufacturing and transmission overhaul service work in our land-based diesel engine services business will continue at relatively high levels for the second quarter, and remain healthy for the remainder of the year.  Orders for new pressure pumping units and new transmissions in the second quarter have yet to materialize, although we have received several customer inquiries.  We expect a slight, seasonal decline for the marine diesel engine and power generation businesses in the second quarter, and steady results the remainder of the year."
Kirby expects 2017 capital spending to be in the $165 to $185 million range, unchanged from previous guidance.  Capital spending guidance includes approximately $50 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment, including a 155,000 barrel ATB, two 4900 horsepower and six 5000 horsepower coastal tugboats.  The balance of $115 to $135 million is primarily for five new inland tank barges and capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities, as well as diesel engine services facilities.

 (1) 
 Kirby has historically evaluated its operating performance using numerous measures, one of which is EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure.  Kirby defines EBITDA as net earnings attributable to Kirby before interest expense, taxes on income, depreciation and amortization.  EBITDA is presented because of its wide acceptance as a financial indicator.  EBITDA is one of the performance measures used in Kirby's incentive bonus plan.  EBITDA is also used by rating agencies in determining Kirby's credit rating and by analysts publishing research reports on Kirby, as well as by investors and investment bankers generally in valuing companies.  EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to, but should only be considered in conjunction with, Kirby's GAAP financial information.   


 (2) 
 Ton miles indicate fleet productivity by measuring the distance (in miles) a loaded tank barge is moved.  Example:  A typical 30,000 barrel tank barge loaded with 3,300 tons of liquid cargo is moved 100 miles, thus generating 330,000 ton miles. 


 (3) 
 Inland marine transportation revenues divided by ton miles.  Example:  First quarter 2017 inland marine transportation revenues of $236,712,000 divided by 2,977,000,000 inland marine transportation ton miles = 8.0 cents. 


 (4) 
 Towboats operated are the average number of owned and chartered towboats operated during the period. 


 (5) 
 Delay days measures the lost time incurred by a tow (towboat and one or more tank barges) during transit.  The measure includes transit delays caused by weather, lock congestion and other navigational factors.

									By Janine Dickens - Posted on: April 5, 2013									



									I purchased my Kirby in July 2011. I was made many promises and guarantees that do not hold up true on this vacuum cleaner. It clogs every time I use it. I go through bags at least 2 a week and I was told after the initial clean I would only have to use one every 2-3 months. And I have brand new carpet and padding. My last vacuum didnt have bags so this was one of the main things that sold me on the kirby was I didnt like to change bags. I also put in a complaint to the company I bought it from, J&L Distributor, a Kirby distributor on Silverada Blvd in Sparks Nv, and they would not even send out a repair person to look at my kirby to see what the problem might be or why it keeps clogging. I get no response to my emails to them. I would appreciate it if someone would please contact me.

Kirby Inland Marine
The Nation's Largest Inland Tank Barge Fleet















Kirby Inland Marine operates the nation’s largest fleet of inland tank barges and towing vessels. Petrochemicals, such as styrene, benzene and methanol; liquid fertilizer, including anhydrous ammonia; refined products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel; black oil, such as asphalt, No. 6 fuel oil, crude oil and coker fuel; and pressurized products, such as butane, propane and butadiene, are transported efficiently and safely from producers to intermediaries to end users.Kirby’s service area spans America’s inland waterway network: The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, the Mississippi River, the Illinois River, the Ohio River and numerous other waterways. Kirby operates 849 active inland tank barges and 220 active towing vessels. Kirby represents the industry leader in safety, customer service and environmental protection.Kirby Inland Marine Operates849 Active Inland Tank Barges220 active towing vessels17.4 million barrels of capacityView Kirby Inland Barge InformationWhy KirbyKirby Inland Marine seeks opportunities where it can add value to the transportation services it provides. Safety and environmental protection are of paramount importance for Kirby and our customers. With respect to these issues, Kirby’s record is exemplary, as recognized by the U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Coast Guard in awarding Kirby the first William M. Benkert Award in 1995.The operating segments comprising Kirby Inland Marine have been certified through a program called International Quality Standard, ISO 9002. ISO certification is difficult to attain, requiring many hours of hard work. The pay off is consistent and reliable service, safer operations and lower costs.In 1998 Kirby became certified under the AWO Responsible Carrier Program. The AWO Responsible Carrier Program insures the implementation of a comprehensive safety management system through the use of 3rd party auditors.Kirby prides itself on having the best-trained crews and support staff in the industry, providing both formal classroom and hands-on instruction at the Kirby Training Center in Houston, Texas.As a leader in our industry, Kirby Inland Marine maintains a strong presence in industry programs, regulations and legislation that affect both our operating environment and that of our customers.With qualifications like these, Kirby Inland Marine has clearly made a strong commitment to be the premier marine transportation company, making your choice for marine transportation services in the United States an obvious one.ServicesThe primary cargoes transported by this fleet are chemicals, petrochemical feedstocks, gasoline additives, refined petroleum products, liquid fertilizer, black oil and pressurized products. This fleet represents the broadest capabilities in the marine inland tank barge industry to satisfy customers’ diverse needs.Kirby Inland Marine is the supplier most likely to have a barge and towboat available nearest a customer’s pickup point and, through a centralized dispatching system, can minimize repositioning and power costs. Kirby Inland Marine brings these operating efficiencies to serve our customers.Where We OperateThe United States inland waterway system extends 26,000 miles, with 12,000 miles used for significant domestic commerce. This navigable waterway system links the United States heartland to the world. Kirby’s primary inland distribution area encompasses the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway from Brownsville, Texas, to St. Marks, Florida, plus the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Kirby Inland Marine is capable of transporting liquid bulk cargoes from one end of this inland waterway network to the other without a change of carrier.How We OperateCanalKirby Inland Marine’s Canal operation encompasses the transportation of petrochemical feedstocks, black oil, pressurized products, processed chemicals and refined products along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, the Mississippi River below Baton Rouge, and in the Houston Ship Channel. Typical service includes the movement of petrochemical feedstocks between refineries and the delivery of processed chemicals and feedstocks to chemical plants and waterfront terminals. A canal tow consists of one to five barges, pushed by an 800 to 2200 horsepower towboat.RiverKirby Inland Marine’s River operation transports petrochemical feedstocks, processed chemicals, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals along the Mississippi, Illinois, Ohio and Arkansas Rivers. A river unit tow typically includes four to eight barges, pushed by a 2000 to 5600 horsepower towboat. River unit tows are generally considered “dedicated”, with the same barges and towboat used for each trip.LinehaulKirby Inland Marine’s Linehaul operation transports petrochemical feedstocks, processed chemicals, agricultural chemicals and lube oils along the Mississippi, Illinois and Ohio Rivers, as well as the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. A linehaul canal tow usually comprises three to five barges with a 1400 to 2200 horsepower towboat.  A linehaul river tow is much longer, consisting of 10 to 25 barges and using a 3000 to 5600 horsepower towboat. The linehaul river tow functions similarly to a freight train, dropping off and picking up barges as it moves up and down the river.Typically, loaded barges containing products from Gulf Coast refineries and petrochemical plants are collected in the lower Mississippi River area near Baton Rouge, Louisiana and transported up river to river-front terminals and plants on the Mississippi, Illinois and Ohio Rivers.Pressurized FleetKirby operates the largest pressurized fleet in the U.S. These pressurized barges can handle products requiring pressures up to 265 psi. Kirby tankermen and shore personnel are specially trained in pressurized transportation technology and have a safety record that is among the best in the industry. Kirby is the leader in the technology of marine transportation of pressurized products. Transporting your pressurized products via Kirby ensures that your products will be delivered safely and reliably.Black Oil FleetKirby’s fleet of black oil barges is equipped to handle the requirements of a wide range of product characteristics. Many of these barges feature high-capacity pumps and onboard heating systems for viscous oils including asphalt. Such flexibility contributes to Kirby’s ability to satisfy our customer’s needs for transporting a wide range of cargo viscosities. Refiners along the Gulf Coast count on Kirby for efficient delivery of black oils to meet their refining schedules.Ship Bunkering Fleet (Fueling of Ships)Ship owners and bunker suppliers rely on Kirby’s fleet of bunkering barges, one of the largest along the Gulf Coast. These barges feature flow-through booms and are dispatched and deployed using a satellite communications system. This system also provides customers with up-to-the-minute position and scheduling information. You can trust Kirby for on-time bunkering to help you control your total cost of operations. Inland Marine  Offshore Marine  Ocean Transport  Osprey Line  Logistics Management
