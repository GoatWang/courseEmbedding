      Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C
    





October 25, 2016 02:07 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C:
    


      --$286,700,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$315,000,000 class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$150,000,000 class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$377,500,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$121,570,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39,520,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26,350,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Credit Quality: The pool is consistent with recent deals, the 
      highest weighted average (WA) FICO score seen to date at 736, and the 
      highest percentage of new vehicles seen to date at 89.8%. The pool is 
      geographically diverse and has WA seasoning of 7.8 months, and 54.5% of 
      the loans have terms of 61 months or more.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      class A notes totals 5.54%, consisting of 5.00% subordination and a 
      0.54% non-declining reserve, all consistent with recent transactions.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      Ford Credit's portfolio and 2012 - 2015 securitizations are currently at 
      low levels, supported by the stable U.S. economy and healthy used 
      vehicle values, although they are expected to soften over the next year. 
      Fitch's initial base case cumulative net loss (CNL) assumption is 1.50%.
    

      Stable Corporate Performance: Fitch's current Long-Term Issuer Default 
      Rating (IDR) for Ford Motor Company (Ford), parent of Ford Credit, and 
      Ford Credit, is 'BBB'/Stable Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as an originator, underwriter and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization delinquency and 
      loss performance. Fitch deems Ford Credit an adequate servicer for this 
      series.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the 
      notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all 
      classes of 2016-C to increased losses over the life of the transaction. 
      Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and losses. Under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario the notes would be unlikely to experience any downgrade. 
      However, the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating 
      categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or re-computing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on its analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.

      Copyright Â© 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

      Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-A
    





January 26, 2016 05:21 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the 
      notes issued by Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-A:
    

      --$228,900,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$200,000,000 class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$163,100,000 class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$305,200,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$102,780,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,580,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,050,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Credit Quality: The 2016-A pool is consistent with prior deals, 
      with a weighted average (WA) FICO score of 734 and 89.5% new vehicle 
      loans. The pool is geographically diverse and has WA seasoning of 
      approximately seven months. Loans with terms of 61 months or more 
      increased to a high of 57.1%, the highest ever to date, and Fitch took 
      this risk into account when deriving the 2016-A loss proxy.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement (CE) Structure: The cash flow distribution 
      is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard CE for the class A notes 
      totals 5.54%, consisting of 5.00% subordination, and a 0.54% 
      non-declining reserve. The transaction begins with zero 
      overcollateralization (OC) and builds to a target of 2.00% of initial 
      adjusted collateral balance plus 1.50% of current balance less reserve.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      Ford Credit's portfolio and 2009-2014 securitizations are currently at 
      low levels, supported by the improving U.S. economy, and stable used 
      vehicle values, although they are expected to soften over the next year. 
      Fitch's initial base case cumulative net loss (CNL) is 1.55%.
    

      Stable Corporate Performance: Fitch's current long-term (LT) Issuer 
      Default Rating (IDR) for Ford Motor Company (Ford), parent of Ford 
      Credit, and Ford Credit is 'BBB-', with a Positive Rating Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as an originator, underwriter, and servicer as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio, securitizations' delinquency, and 
      loss performance. Fitch deems Ford Credit an adequate servicer for 
      2016-A. Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the 
      transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not 
      impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the 
      notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all 
      classes of 2016-A to increased losses over the life of the transaction. 
      Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and losses. Under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario the notes would be unlikely to experience any downgrade. 
      However, the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating 
      categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or re-computing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on its analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link at the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled Ford Credit Auto Owner 
      Trust 2016-A-- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W 
      for the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, 
      Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance 
      Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.

      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-CHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on FirefoxÂ Â»YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-CBusiness WireOctober 25, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C:--$286,700,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';--$315,000,000 class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$150,000,000 class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$377,500,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$121,570,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$39,520,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$26,350,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERSStable Credit Quality: The pool is consistent with recent deals, the highest weighted average (WA) FICO score seen to date at 736, and the highest percentage of new vehicles seen to date at 89.8%. The pool is geographically diverse and has WA seasoning of 7.8 months, and 54.5% of the loans have terms of 61 months or more.Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A notes totals 5.54%, consisting of 5.00% subordination and a 0.54% non-declining reserve, all consistent with recent transactions.Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on Ford Credit's portfolio and 2012 - 2015 securitizations are currently at low levels, supported by the stable U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle values, although they are expected to soften over the next year. Fitch's initial base case cumulative net loss (CNL) assumption is 1.50%.Stable Corporate Performance: Fitch's current Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Ford Motor Company (Ford), parent of Ford Credit, and Ford Credit, is 'BBB'/Stable Outlook.Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates adequate abilities as an originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization delinquency and loss performance. Fitch deems Ford Credit an adequate servicer for this series.Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 2016-C to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. Under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario the notes would be unlikely to experience any downgrade. However, the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or re-computing certain information with respect to 125 loans from the statistical data file.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
