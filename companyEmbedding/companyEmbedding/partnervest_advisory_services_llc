The Power of Partnership





Synergized in Vision, Strength and Purpose 





As the financial services industry has grown more complex, many advisors have expanded their practices through partnerships.  Some have wanted innovative investment strategies to meet their clients’ needs for income and better risk management.  Others have looked for a platform that would offer a full range of products and services that support their business development. Most are looking for someone who will listen and be collaborative in their approach to success. For these advisors, Partnervest has become the partner of choice.

What makes a firm a good partner?  Certainly having the right products and services is important, but it is just a starting point.  Advisors also want a partner who understands their clients’ needs, can support the advisor on an individual basis, and is reliable and highly regarded.
If your practice could use that kind of partnership, consider Partnervest.  This site has more information on our Investments, Advisor Services, Practice Management and more.

Welcome"When it comes to our investment portfolios, most of us rely on the vague notion that 'the market always goes up over time' as the only backstop against loss. However, there is a much better approach, it is called hedging." Harry S. Dent, author - "The Great Depression Ahead""We always want to be hedged." Mark Taborsky, Exec. VP, Asset Allocation, PIMCOWe are Fee-Only Investment Advisors who focus on investment hedging strategies, managing portfolios for:Individuals; Non-profit Organizations; and401(k) plans All of our investments and strategies are sales commission free, have no surrender charge or early withdrawal penalty, and have low administrative fees. We specialize in income generation strategies on index funds.Key to Performance:We believe that one key to productive investments is the Investment Strategy, and that Buy & Hold (pay and pray) has run its course, and is a decade too late. The flexibility of our strategies, which include both the use of hedging strategies to protect downside risk and income generation techniques, gives us the ability to best manage investment risks in any investment market - bull, bear or flat.Why we pursue our Strategy:Sophisticated hedging strategies can create safety nets for investments, and can create profits in rising, falling or flat markets. Bull markets may well be in our future, but the risk required to profit from bull markets can create significant losses during bear markets, and can easily generate losses that may not be overcome during an investment lifetime. Our investment hedging strategies address the issues of: Safety Nets for each investment; Potential profits in  any market condition; andCash Flow to the investorWe have successfully created a conduit between the private investor and hedging strategies, which have typically been available only to institutional clients and the very wealthy.The investment strategies that we use are designed to perform in ways well beyond the typical "Long only" buy & hold strategies that are used by many private investors. We are Fee-Only Advisors, and have taken considerable time and expense to develop the strategies that we use for our clients. Their well-being is always our first concern, and we are pleased to share with you some of the ideas and strategies that we use for our clients.We hope that this site is able to convey the opportunity and uniqueness that exist in the strategies we use for our clients.We look forward to hearing from you,Charley Wright Investment Advisory provided through Partnervest Advisory Services, LLC.

The Power of Partnership





Synergized in Vision, Strength and Purpose 





As the financial services industry has grown more complex, many advisors have expanded their practices through partnerships.  Some have wanted innovative investment strategies to meet their clients’ needs for income and better risk management.  Others have looked for a platform that would offer a full range of products and services that support their business development. Most are looking for someone who will listen and be collaborative in their approach to success. For these advisors, Partnervest has become the partner of choice.

What makes a firm a good partner?  Certainly having the right products and services is important, but it is just a starting point.  Advisors also want a partner who understands their clients’ needs, can support the advisor on an individual basis, and is reliable and highly regarded.
If your practice could use that kind of partnership, consider Partnervest.  This site has more information on our Investments, Advisor Services, Practice Management and more.
