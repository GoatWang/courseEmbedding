Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. and Sagard Capital Partners have agreed to make a joint bid to acquire Performance Sports Group Ltd. for more than $550 million as the sports equipment maker considers a plan to auction itself under bankruptcy court protection, one person familiar with the plans said. Performance Sports is preparing to file for protection from its creditors as early as Monday under chapter 11 in the United States and a similar court process in Canada, the person said. The Exeter, N.H., company was unable to win an extension from its lenders on a deadline Friday to file its overdue audited annual financial statements. The missed deadline puts the company at risk of defaulting on some debts. As always, the deal could fall apart. There is no guarantee that Performance Sports will file for bankruptcy protection or that its lenders will support a sale of the struggling company's business. Fairfax, Sagard and Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management said last week they were considering a possible play for Performance Sports, which dominates the North American sports market with such brands as Bauer hockey gear and Easton baseball equipment. Brookfield remains interested in supporting the Fairfax and Sagard bid, the person said, but hasn't yet decided whether to join the takeover bid or lend money through a so-called debtor-in-possession loan. Such financing would allow Performance Sports to continue operating without interruption, pending a court-supervised auction process. Proposed bankruptcy buyouts are typically tested at auction to ensure creditors receive the highest recovery on what they're owed. Brookfield and Sagard together own a 30% stake in the company. As of April, Performance Sports owed $330.5 million to term lenders and $119. 2 million on an asset-based loan. Although Performance Sports has a large market share in each of the hockey, baseball, lacrosse and roller hockey sectors for which it makes skates, gloves, bats and other equipment, the company has struggled in the last two years with debts it shouldered to acquire Easton's baseball and softball business for $330 million in 2014. Since the acquisition, the company's baseball division has been beset with product problems and disappointing sales, triggered in part by a spate of bankruptcy filings by retail sports-equipment chains that stock its goods. The bankruptcy filing and subsequent liquidation of Sports Authority Holdings Inc. in March triggered a $90 million loss of Performance Sports inventory, according to a person familiar with the matter. Performance Sports is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange. In the last year the company's stock has dropped more than 66%. Shortly after the company announced in August that it was unable to file its annual results because of an internal investigation, it revealed it is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a Canadian securities regulator. --Lillian Rizzo contributed to this article.

NEW YORK, March 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Sagard Capital") announce that 9938982 Canada Inc. (the "Purchaser"), an acquisition vehicle co-owned by Sagard Capital and Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited ("Fairfax Financial"), has completed the purchase of substantially all the assets of Performance Sports Group Ltd. (the "Issuer") and its North American subsidiaries (the "Debtors"), including its European and global operations, for a base purchase price of U.S. $575 million in aggregate, subject to certain adjustments, and the assumption of related operating liabilities (the "Acquisition").








The Acquisition was the culmination of the process commenced by the Debtors who, in order to facilitate the Acquisition, filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the District of Delaware and filed an application for the issuance of an initial order under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The bid made by the Purchaser served as the "stalking horse" bid for purposes of the process and was ultimately determined to be the successful bid in accordance with the related court approved bidding procedures. The courts approved the Acquisition and associated reorganization transactions pursuant to orders dated February 6, 2017 and supplemented on February 10, 2017.
The Issuer's head office is located at 100 Domain Drive, Exeter, New Hampshire, U.S.A., 03833.

NEW YORK, Oct. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "        Sagard Capital
") announce that Sagard Capital and Brookfield Capital Partners Ltd. ()        Brookfield
") have entered into a confidentiality agreement relating to the Issuer and its confidential information, as required by Sagard's existing confidentiality agreement with Performance Sports Group Ltd. (the "        Issuer
"), and any other confidential information provided by or on behalf of Sagard Capital to Brookfield.


                                        








As previously announced, Sagard Capital and the Issuer, and their respective advisors, have discussed the possibility of Sagard Capital, and potentially one or more co-investors (including Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited ("        Fairfax
") as described below) partnering with Sagard Capital, proposing potential plans or proposals that may involve one or more of the following related to the Issuer ()        Potential Transaction
"): restructurings; possible issuances by the Issuer of additional and/or refinancing indebtedness; the acquisition of indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries; and/or other strategic alternatives.  Any such plans or proposals may be directed to or discussed with the Issuer, its advisors, its securityholders and/or its lenders, with advisors to Sagard Capital and/or with potential sources of financing and co-investors for any of the foregoing, among others.  Sagard Capital and their advisors have also conducted, and continue to conduct, a due diligence review of the Issuer and its subsidiaries.  Sagard Capital presently expects to continue discussions with additional potential sources of financing and/or co-investors for any Potential Transaction, and with the Issuer related to a possible Potential Transaction.


                                        








Sagard Capital and Brookfield and their respective representatives may discuss the possibility of Sagard Capital and Brookfield, and/or one or more entities to be formed at the direction of Sagard Capital, acting together with respect to potential plans or proposals related to a Potential Transaction. Sagard Capital and Brookfield have not yet entered into any agreements, term sheets, or other arrangements among themselves with respect to any joint activity and it is presently uncertain whether Sagard and Brookfield, and/or an entity formed thereby, on the one hand, and the Issuer, on the other hand, will agree to any definitive agreement with respect to any Potential Transaction, or that any Potential Transaction will occur.


                                        








As previously announced, Sagard has also entered into a confidentiality agreement with Fairfax relating to the Issuer and its confidential information, as required by Sagard's existing confidentiality agreement with the Issuer, and any other confidential information provided by or on behalf of Sagard to Fairfax. Sagard Capital, Fairfax and their respective representatives have discussed the possibility of Sagard Capital and Fairfax, and/or one or more entities to be formed at their direction, acting together with respect to potential plans or proposals related to a Potential Transaction.  Fairfax and/or its representatives have participated with Sagard Capital and/or their representatives in discussions with the Issuer regarding such matters. 


                                        








Sagard Capital and Fairfax have not yet entered into any agreements, term sheets, or other arrangements among themselves with respect to any joint activity. However, based on discussions to date, Sagard Capital has concluded that it is likely that, if they proceed with a plan or proposal to effect any Potential Transaction, they will proceed with Fairfax and/or one of its affiliates. It is possible that, depending on discussions with Brookfield, Brookfield may be an additional participant in such a plan or proposal submitted by Sagard Capital (and Fairfax, if applicable).


                                        








There can be no assurance that Sagard Capital will submit a plan or proposal with respect to any of the foregoing, that Sagard Capital or any other person (including the Issuer, Fairfax, Brookfield and/or an entity formed thereby) will agree to any definitive agreement with respect to any of the foregoing, or that any of the foregoing (including a Potential Transaction) will occur.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to constitute an offer to sell or purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase any securities, nor shall there be any purchase or sale of any securities in any province, country, state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such province, country, state or jurisdiction.

Atlantic Media selling ownership stake to organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs
              
              Emerson Collective, founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of late Apple founder Steve Jobs, is acquiring a majority ownership stake in The Atlantic. According to a news release on Friday Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley told staff of the deal, which includes its flagship magazine, digital properties, live events business and consulting services. Bradley, through Atlantic Media, will hold a minority stake and continue to run The Atlantic for the next three to five years. In a letter to The Atlantic staff Bradley said, "Against the odds, The Atlantic is prospering. While I will stay at the helm some years, the most consequential decision of my career now is behind me: Who next will take stewardship of this 160-year-old national treasure? To me, the answer, in the form of Laurene, feels incomparably right." The terms of the deal were not disclosed. In the 18 years since Bradley acquired the magazine from Mortimer Zuckerman, digital readership has grown to a monthly average of 33 million unique visitors from 2 million in 2009, and it generates profits above $10 million per year after recording losses of more than $10 million a year in Bradley's early days. About 20% of the magazine's revenue comes from print advertising with 80% coming in digital advertising.

Electronic Arts shares slide 3% as outlook falls short
              
              Shares of Electronic Arts Inc.  were down 3% in premarket trade Friday, after the video game company offered a disappointing outlook for the second quarter. The company topped first-quarter profit and revenue estimates, but said it expects a net loss of $57 million and a loss per share of 18 cents for the second quarter, wider than the 6 cents forecast by FactSet.  Analysts were generally positive on the numbers, despite the outlook. "Overall, we thought this was a good start for EA, showcasing the healthy underlying trends or digital, which also serves as positive read-through to other video game publishers such as Activision Blizzard  and Take-Two --both are scheduled to report quarterly results next week," Stifel analysts wrote in a note. Electronic Arts shares have gained 49% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 11%.

Goodyear Tire's stock dives after slashed profit outlook offsets in-line earnings
              
              Shares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  plunged 9.3% in premarket trade Friday, after the tire maker slashed its 2017 profit outlook. Net profit for the quarter to June 30 fell to $147 million, or 58 cents a share, from $202 million, or 75 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 70 cents, matching the FactSet consensus. Revenue slipped to $3.69 billion from $3.88 billion, just shy of the FactSet consensus of $3.73 billion. The company cut its 2017 guidance for segment operating income to a range of $1.60 billion to $1.65 billion from "approximately" $2.0 billion. "In addition to higher raw material costs, we have seen a weakening in OE and consumer replacement demand across many of our key markets during the first half, despite strong underlying industry fundamentals," said Chief Executive Richard Kramer. "The combination of these factors has led to a highly unusual first half environment, particularly given the favorable trends in miles driven, gasoline prices and unemployment that are generally supportive of our industry." The stock has rallied 14.9% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.6%.

Ford reports Q2 earnings above Wall Street expectations, gives positive 2017 guidance
              
              Shares of Ford Motor Co.  rose 1.6% before heading down in premarket trade on Wednesday after the company reported second-quarter profit and revenue that was above Wall Street expectations. Net income for the quarter came in at $2.04 billion, or 51 cents per share, compared with $1.97 billion, or 49 cents per share during the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share were 56 cents, above FactSet's earnings consensus for 43 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter hit $39.85 billion, compared with $39.49 billion during the same period a year ago. Revenue was above FactSet's expected $37.28 billion consensus. Revenue from automotive sales were up to $37.11 billion in the quarter, compared with $36.93 billion a year ago, and the company said that automotive profits were driven by North America.

Destination Maternity plummets toward record low after merger deal terminated
              
              Shares of Destination Maternity Corp.  plummeted 38% toward a record low in early trade Friday, enough to be the biggest decliners on the Nasdaq exchange, after the maternity apparel seller said the deal to be acquired by France-based Orchestra-Premaman SA  has been terminated. The company said the deal was terminated given the difficulties of satisfying regulators in France and the U.S., and given the uncertainty over whether regulatory requirements could be satisfied without unreasonable effort and expense. The companies had announced on Dec. 20, 2016 that Orchestra-Premaman would buy Destination Maternity for an implied price of $7.05 a share, which represented just a 0.4% premium to the Dec. 19 closing price. The stock had tumbled 58% since the merger announcement through Thursday, while the S&P 500  had climbed 9.4%.

Invisalign maker Align stocks surge 8% after earnings blow past estimates
              
              Align Technology Inc. shares  surged 8% Friday, after the maker of Invisalign dental braces blew past second-quarter earnings estimates. San Jose, California-based Align said late Thursday it had net income of $69.2 million, or $85 cents a share, in the quarter,  up from $50.1 million, or 62 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $356.5 million from $176.9 million. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 72 cents and revenue of $344 million. North American shipments rose 27.6% while international shipments jumped 37%. The company said Invisalign shipments to the teen market rose 37.6%, after hitting a milestone of 1 million teen patients.  The company said it now expects net revenue of $355 million to $360 million in the third quarter, and EPS of 78 cents to 81 cents. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of 81 cents and revenue of $359 million. Leerink analysts welcomed the progress made in the key teen market. "Our recent diligence suggests that orthodontists see Invisalign potentially capable of addressing 60+% of their Teen cases, which would be well-above our 8% estimated penetration into Align's North American teen TAM ("fully loaded" ~3.94M cases) by 2020," they wrote in a note. Align shares have gained 77% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 11%.

Merck expects June cyberattack to affect company's 2017 financial performance
              
              Merck & Co. Inc.  said Friday that a network cyberattack in late June caused it to issue conservative 2017 guidance. The June 27 cyberattack disrupted the company's global operations, including manufacturing, research and sales, and Merck said it has been working to restore operations. Merck said it "does not yet know the magnitude of the impact of the disruption," but that guidance would have been higher if not for the cyberattack's impact. Merck said it can continue to supply its top products, including cancer drug Keytruda and diabetes drug Januvia, but there will be temporary delays in some other products in certain markets. Merck, which reported second-quarter profit and revenue beats on Friday, also affirmed its 2017 adjusted EPS outlook of $3.76 to $3.88, with Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis saying that "the strength of the business has allowed us to absorb the potential impact from the cyber attack," according to the FactSet earnings call transcript. Merck was one of several global companies hit by massive cyberattacks in late June. Merck shares lifted 0.4% in premarket trade Friday. Shares surged 2.2% over the last three months, compared with a 3.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Sagard Capital Partners, L.P.

NEW YORK, Oct. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Sagard Capital") announce that Sagard Capital and Brookfield Capital Partners Ltd. ("Brookfield") have entered into a confidentiality agreement relating to the Issuer and its confidential information, as required by Sagard's existing confidentiality agreement with Performance Sports Group Ltd. (the "Issuer"), and any other confidential information provided by or on behalf of Sagard Capital to Brookfield.








As previously announced, Sagard Capital and the Issuer, and their respective advisors, have discussed the possibility of Sagard Capital, and potentially one or more co-investors (including Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited ("Fairfax") as described below) partnering with Sagard Capital, proposing potential plans or proposals that may involve one or more of the following related to the Issuer (each, a "Potential Transaction"): restructurings; possible issuances by the Issuer of additional and/or refinancing indebtedness; the acquisition of indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries; and/or other strategic alternatives.  Any such plans or proposals may be directed to or discussed with the Issuer, its advisors, its securityholders and/or its lenders, with advisors to Sagard Capital and/or with potential sources of financing and co-investors for any of the foregoing, among others.  Sagard Capital and their advisors have also conducted, and continue to conduct, a due diligence review of the Issuer and its subsidiaries.  Sagard Capital presently expects to continue discussions with additional potential sources of financing and/or co-investors for any Potential Transaction, and with the Issuer related to a possible Potential Transaction.
Sagard Capital and Brookfield and their respective representatives may discuss the possibility of Sagard Capital and Brookfield, and/or one or more entities to be formed at the direction of Sagard Capital, acting together with respect to potential plans or proposals related to a Potential Transaction. Sagard Capital and Brookfield have not yet entered into any agreements, term sheets, or other arrangements among themselves with respect to any joint activity and it is presently uncertain whether Sagard and Brookfield, and/or an entity formed thereby, on the one hand, and the Issuer, on the other hand, will agree to any definitive agreement with respect to any Potential Transaction, or that any Potential Transaction will occur.
As previously announced, Sagard has also entered into a confidentiality agreement with Fairfax relating to the Issuer and its confidential information, as required by Sagard's existing confidentiality agreement with the Issuer, and any other confidential information provided by or on behalf of Sagard to Fairfax. Sagard Capital, Fairfax and their respective representatives have discussed the possibility of Sagard Capital and Fairfax, and/or one or more entities to be formed at their direction, acting together with respect to potential plans or proposals related to a Potential Transaction.  Fairfax and/or its representatives have participated with Sagard Capital and/or their representatives in discussions with the Issuer regarding such matters.  
Sagard Capital and Fairfax have not yet entered into any agreements, term sheets, or other arrangements among themselves with respect to any joint activity. However, based on discussions to date, Sagard Capital has concluded that it is likely that, if they proceed with a plan or proposal to effect any Potential Transaction, they will proceed with Fairfax and/or one of its affiliates. It is possible that, depending on discussions with Brookfield, Brookfield may be an additional participant in such a plan or proposal submitted by Sagard Capital (and Fairfax, if applicable).
There can be no assurance that Sagard Capital will submit a plan or proposal with respect to any of the foregoing, that Sagard Capital or any other person (including the Issuer, Fairfax, Brookfield and/or an entity formed thereby) will agree to any definitive agreement with respect to any of the foregoing, or that any of the foregoing (including a Potential Transaction) will occur.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to constitute an offer to sell or purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase any securities, nor shall there be any purchase or sale of any securities in any province, country, state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such province, country, state or jurisdiction.
Sagard Capital further discloses that it continues to beneficially own and control an aggregate of 7,721,599 common shares of the Issuer ("Shares"), representing approximately 16.9% of the issued and outstanding Shares. Fairfax has informed Sagard Capital that Fairfax does not have ownership or control over any Shares as of the date hereof.  Brookfield has informed Sagard Capital that 251091708 Delaware LP, a Delaware limited partnership indirectly controlled by Brookfield, has ownership and control over 6,026,860 Shares of the Issuer, representing approximately 13.23% of the issued and outstanding Shares.
Sagard Capital, a subsidiary of Power Corporation of Canada, is relying on Part 5 of National Instrument 62-103 in respect of aggregation relief relating to any securities that may be held by Great-West Lifeco Inc. and its subsidiaries, IGM Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries, and any investment fund managed by entities within the Power Corporation of Canada group of companies.
The Issuer's head office is located at 100 Domain Drive, Exeter, New Hampshire, U.S.A., 03833.

Performance Sports Group Completes Sale of Substantially All of Its Assets to Investor Group Led by Sagard and Fairfax Financial































































































  














Performance Sports Group Completes Sale of Substantially All of Its Assets to Investor Group Led by Sagard and Fairfax Financial 






EXETER, N.H., Feb. 28, 2017 – Performance Sports Group Ltd. (“Performance Sports Group” or the “Company”) announces the completion of the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company and its North American subsidiaries, including its European and global operations (the “Sale”), to an acquisition vehicle co-owned by affiliates of Sagard Holdings Inc. and Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (the “Purchaser”).
The new, privately held company will be a leading developer and manufacturer of ice hockey, roller hockey, lacrosse, baseball and softball sports equipment, as well as related apparel. Its products will be marketed under the BAUER, MISSION, MAVERIK, CASCADE and EASTON brand names and will be distributed by sales representatives and independent distributors throughout the world. Harlan Kent, who previously served as the Chief Executive Officer of Performance Sports Group, will continue to lead the business on an interim basis while a search for a permanent CEO is underway.







The Sale is the culmination of the process commenced by the Company and its North American subsidiaries pursuant to creditor protection proceedings launched on October 31, 2016 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, and in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code. The Company conducted a court-supervised sale and auction process as part of its Canadian and U.S. court proceedings. The bid made by the Purchaser served as the “stalking horse” bid for purposes of the process and was ultimately determined to be the successful bid in accordance with the related court approved bidding procedures. The courts approved the Sale and associated reorganization transactions pursuant to orders dated February 6, 2017 and supplemented on February 10, 2017.
Paul Desmarais III, Executive Chairman of Sagard Holdings, will serve as chairman of the new company as it transitions to new leadership. He said: “We are excited to build upon the achievements of some of the most innovative and iconic brands in sports. In partnership with Fairfax Financial, we look forward to growing a strong business that is committed to serving a loyal base of customers for the long term. We thank all of Performance Sports Group’s people, and especially Harlan Kent, for effectively managing the business through the restructuring process and helping to position it for future success.”
Paul Rivett, President of Fairfax Financial, said: “The business is founded upon the strong pillars of its portfolio of industry-leading brands, strong customer relationships and dedicated employees. We will work with Sagard Holdings and the management team to continue innovating and delivering industry-leading products to consumers around the world. We believe that the business has a very bright future and we are excited to help guide the company for many years to come.”
Kent said: “During the restructuring process, our team worked very hard to continue to provide outstanding products and service to our customers and to be valued partners to our vendors. I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of my colleagues and for the continued support of our customers and vendors. We look forward to working with the new owners to transition the business to its next successful chapter.”
Following closing of the Sale, Karyn O. Barsa, C. Michael Jacobi, Harlan Kent and Bob Nicholson have resigned from the board of directors of the Company.
Bernard McDonell, Chairman of the Board of Performance Sports Group, said: “On behalf of the board, we would like to thank the retiring directors, Harlan, and all the Company’s employees for their contributions to bringing this sale to completion. We wish them all the best in their future endeavors.”
Upon consummation of the Sale, the Company will no longer exist as an operating business and will instead, along with its professional advisors, focus on the completion of its U.S. and Canadian bankruptcy proceedings. This entails, among other things, reconciling claims against the bankruptcy estates and developing a distribution strategy for the sale proceeds in the U.S. and Canadian proceedings, through a liquidating plan or otherwise. Further information will be provided within the context of the Canadian and U.S. court proceedings.
