OCC SMPTE: THE SIGNAL OF RELIABILITY
Offering the durability you expect from OCC, the comprehensive new SMPTE family of products includes 7 cables to fit each unique application, enclosures, and assemblies, allowing you to source all your connection needs from one source.










RUGGED 
Most of OCC’s SMPTE cables are made with the Ultra-Fox™ Plus deployable buffer system: triple thickness 500 micron acrylate coating, together with a hard elastomer 900 micron tight buffer offer maximum fiber protection.



LESS MIGRATION 
OCC’s SMPTE cables use fabric fillers and nylon wrap instead of PVC, which minimizes cable migration and increases flexibility.



 EASY INSTALLATION
Fibers and power groups in OCC’s SMPTE 3-IN-1 Stadium cable are uniquely identified by TIA color coding standards, making installation easier and less





 LIGHTER
The Aramid yarn central strength member in SMPTE FLEX increases flexibility and decreases weight: a must when truck weight is a consideration.


GET THE DETAILS






Billions of fiber meters cabled.




A History of Innovation








OCC’s founding engineers worked with “The Father of Fiber Optics,” Charles Kao, who later accepted the Noble Prize in Physics.








OCC Worked with NASA and the U.S. Armed Forces to develop rugged, reliable fiber cable for extreme environments.








The Low Crosstalk Electrical Connector System patent granted to SMP (later OCC) enabled RJ-45 style connectors to achieve Category 5 levels of performance, thus allowing for Gigabit Ethernet data transmission speeds.








The Category 5 patent was the first to be used extensively in Ethernet connections, as well as telephonic systems and other data transmissions around the world. 








Based off of our innovative work with the U.S. Military, OCC expands into commercial and enterprise cabling.








OCC acquired Applied Optical Systems, a designer, developer and manufacturer of specialty fiber optic connectors and connectivity solutions for military and harsh environment applications.









OCC granted the first patents on Category 8 Jacks and Plugs; the Cat8 Jacks feature a new, innovative, easy-to-terminate construction.

A Tactical History



In the early 80s, when the U.S. Military needed an extremely strong, lightweight, rugged, and survivable fiber optic cable that was able to efficiently transmit previously unprecedented volumes of data in the field, they came to a promising new company called OCC.   OCC and its engineers were at the forefront of the development of the tight-buffered, tight-bound cable technology that met these criteria. The result: cables that were easy to deploy and performed under the harshest of conditions.
OCC's success in the battlefield provided a foundation for the creation of our broad fiber optic cable offering and the rest, as they say, is history.








WE STARTED BY REVOLUTIONIZING THE DESIGN OF A CABLE.










WHY WE’RE A LEADER IN THE CABLE AND CONNECTIVITY INDUSTRY
When we first built our reputation as pioneers in fiber optic cable, OCC made a commitment to quality, performance, and service. Today, we are leaders in the engineering and manufacturing of a variety of high-performance, top-tier cabling and connectivity solutions. Our customers are leaders themselves.

Corporate Overview From the development of our first cables through our current product offering, which ranks among the industry's most comprehensive, Optical Cable Corporation (OCC®) is a company that provides uncompromising product quality and performance, with solutions for a multitude of market applications.  OCC has earned a reputation as an industry leader, an innovator and a designer of some of the highest-performing cabling and connectivity products available. For years, OCC has been internationally recognized for pioneering the design and production of fiber optic cables. Today, OCC is internationally recognized as a leader in engineering and manufacturing a complete line of top-tier cabling and connectivity solutions, including products and solutions suitable for the most demanding applications.  Optical Cable Corporation: We started by revolutionizing the design of a cable. We evolved to change the way the world communicates. Founded in 1983, OCC was among the first companies to realize the potential of fiber optics through designing and manufacturing some of the most reliable, rugged and innovative cable products in the world. The U.S. Military needed an extremely strong, lightweight, rugged, and survivable fiber optic cable, able to efficiently transmit previously unprecedented volumes of data in the field.  OCC and its engineers were at the forefront of the development of the tight-buffered, tight-bound cable technology that met these criteria. The result: cables that were easy to deploy and performed under the harshest of conditions.  OCC's success in the battlefield provided a foundation for the creation of a broad fiber optic cable offering built on the evolution of our technologies, as well as opportunities to expand our product offerings beyond fiber optic cabling.  OCC has evolved into a world-class provider of a complete line of fiber optic and copper cabling and connectivity products to a broad customer base. While out heritage started with military, our expertise now extends in to the enterprise, broadcast, industrial,  harsh environment, and various specialty markets, and reaches worldwide through our network of distributors with customers in more than 70 countries.  The acquisition of two industry leaders enables OCC to easily transition from a leading provider of fiber optic cables to a company offering a complete integrated suite of cabling and connectivity solutions.  Located just outside of Asheville, our North Carolina facility manufactures products using innovative and patented technologies, offering our customers a full range of fiber optic and copper data communication connectivity products. OCC engineers at this facility actively develop products not only to enhance connectivity and networking, but also to establish test and measurement standards for the entire communications industry.  Our Dallas, Texas facility provides OCC with innovative expertise and the capability to manufacture specialty fiber optic connectors and connectivity solutions of military and harsh environment applications. OCC's groundbreaking innovations in hardened connectors have become the standard for field tactical military communications, stadium broadcasts, and critical mining applications.  By expanding our capabilities and product offerings, we have strategically positioned OCC to support our customers' need for increasingly sophisticated communications infrastructure and end-to-end cabling and connectivity solutions.  Before being acquired by OCC, each new facility was a world-class technology leader in its own right. Now, together as Optical Cable Corporation, we have become a total cabling and connectivity solutions provider for our customers.  TODAY- Helping the world communicate faster. Today OCC products are at work from mission critical data center applications to broadcast cables transmitting on location; consistently meeting the demanding survivability standards for the toughest environmental and mechanical stresses.  From extreme temperatures to dust, chemicals, and vibration- even in mining applications where installations stretch for miles- OCC products are relied upon time and time again for successful environmental and safety monitoring; equipment control; security; and voice, data and video communications.  We are proud that our products provide the conduit that helps businesses, government, and the military communicate with speed and clarity.  OCC's reliable, high-quality, warranted products must meet the company's own tough standards- which are often more stringent that industry standards. We utilize customized and proprietary control and automation systems in our manufacturing processes to meet our precise tolerance and performance levels.  OCC is headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia, and each of our three manufacturing facilities is located in the U.S.  OCC's quality-management system and manufacturing facilities in Roanoke, Asheville, and Dallas are ISO 9001:2008 registered, and our Roanoke and Dallas facilities are certified by the U.S. Department of Defense as MIL-STD-790F, a reflection of strict compliance with government requirements.

OCC SMPTE: THE SIGNAL OF RELIABILITY
Offering the durability you expect from OCC, the comprehensive new SMPTE family of products includes 7 cables to fit each unique application, enclosures, and assemblies, allowing you to source all your connection needs from one source.










RUGGED 
Most of OCC’s SMPTE cables are made with the Ultra-Fox™ Plus deployable buffer system: triple thickness 500 micron acrylate coating, together with a hard elastomer 900 micron tight buffer offer maximum fiber protection.



LESS MIGRATION 
OCC’s SMPTE cables use fabric fillers and nylon wrap instead of PVC, which minimizes cable migration and increases flexibility.



 EASY INSTALLATION
Fibers and power groups in OCC’s SMPTE 3-IN-1 Stadium cable are uniquely identified by TIA color coding standards, making installation easier and less





 LIGHTER
The Aramid yarn central strength member in SMPTE FLEX increases flexibility and decreases weight: a must when truck weight is a consideration.


GET THE DETAILS






Billions of fiber meters cabled.




A History of Innovation








OCC’s founding engineers worked with “The Father of Fiber Optics,” Charles Kao, who later accepted the Noble Prize in Physics.








OCC Worked with NASA and the U.S. Armed Forces to develop rugged, reliable fiber cable for extreme environments.








The Low Crosstalk Electrical Connector System patent granted to SMP (later OCC) enabled RJ-45 style connectors to achieve Category 5 levels of performance, thus allowing for Gigabit Ethernet data transmission speeds.








The Category 5 patent was the first to be used extensively in Ethernet connections, as well as telephonic systems and other data transmissions around the world. 








Based off of our innovative work with the U.S. Military, OCC expands into commercial and enterprise cabling.








OCC acquired Applied Optical Systems, a designer, developer and manufacturer of specialty fiber optic connectors and connectivity solutions for military and harsh environment applications.









OCC granted the first patents on Category 8 Jacks and Plugs; the Cat8 Jacks feature a new, innovative, easy-to-terminate construction.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
