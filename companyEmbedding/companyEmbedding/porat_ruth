Alphabet’s CFO says Home and Nest are different entities

Whether it seems intuitive or not, the two hardware units are staying separate.

Alphabet has two smart home systems: Google Home and separate Alphabet subsidiary Nest. And it’s going to stay that way, said Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat at the Code Conference Wednesday in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. 
“Our view is that Home is pursuing one path and Nest is looking at a different set of products and go-to-market strategy,” she said.
This view is not necessarily intuitive given the overlap between the two companies, not just from a consumer perspective but from the perspective of companies that work with the products. 
“It’s really a huge separation between dealing with the Nest people and product line and the Google Home people and product line,” said HelloTech CEO Richard Wolpert, whose on-demand tech setup and support company installs Nest and Home devices.
The Nest suite of smart home products was originally part of Google before being spun out into its own company when Google reorganized into Alphabet. 
That spinout happened before Google introduced the Home device, an artificially intelligent hub that responds to voice commands and controls smart devices from a variety of makers, including Nest.
Nest co-founder and CEO Tony Fadell left the company about a year ago, raising questions at the time about whether there might be a change in direction or whether Alphabet might just sell the company. 
“I think that we have evolved the business,” Porat said when Kara Swisher asked about Fadell’s departure. 
She said Alphabet was happy with Nest’s performance. 
“I talk about them every quarter. We’re very pleased with what they’re doing. They are continuing to expand globally, expand the product suite,” she said. “We have found areas where its efficient to work with the Google hardware team but they are a separate entity within other bets.”

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

                Porat encourages employees to find a satisfying “mix” of family and work.





Porat: 'The most powerful woman on Wall Street'





 Share on Facebook
 Share on Twitter


Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer at Morgan Stanley, has one especially cherished item on her desk in midtown Manhattan. 
 It’s a note from her three boys from 2008 when Porat was working around the clock to help the Federal Reserve save American International Group, the giant insurance company whose imminent failure threatened to nuke an already crashing global economy. Story Continued Below






 “On one of those nights where we were working through the night, I came home and my three boys left me a little note because they knew I’d at least come home and shower,” Porat recalled in an interview. Though she didn’t say what exactly her boys wrote, she added “in their own words, three different personalities underscored how very proud they were and how important they thought the work was.” 
 ( Also on POLITICO: Money gap: Why don't women give?) 
 Porat, often called “the most powerful woman on Wall Street,” viewed it as a triumph of her career-long approach to “work-life balance,” a phrase she abhors. “It was really sweet because it said to me, ‘They get it.’ They’re proud … and they have been integrated into Morgan Stanley throughout their lives.” 
 Instead of “balance” — something she says sets women (and increasingly men) up to fail — Porat encourages employees to find a satisfying “mix” of family and work in their lives. The mix will shift depending on needs in both places, but the two should never be fully isolated from each other. 
 Porat grew up in northern England, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto, California, the daughter of a research engineer father and psychologist mother. There was never any question that she would have both a family and a major career. 
 After undergrad at Stanford and a pair of master’s degrees, Porat, 57, entered Morgan Stanley in 1987 and quickly became a mergers-and-acquisitions whiz before leaving for Smith Barney in 1993. 
 ( Also on POLITICO: Maya Wiley's push for civil rights) 
 It was a rare career misstep for Porat, who immediately realized she wanted to return to Morgan Stanley, which she did in 1996 going on to head a pair of investment banking teams before becoming chief financial officer in 2010. 
 In her current role, Porat, alongside Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman, has retooled the blue chip bank’s business mix into a more stable, post-crisis franchise that is in many ways now the envy of Wall Street. 
 Why aren’t there more women in senior positions of power, including CEOs, on Wall Street? If there were, would some of the meltdowns not have happened? 
 When I started there were very few women at the managing director level and very few who had families, which is something that was important to me. So it’s not like when I looked up I could say, “Well, that’s who I want to be.” And you see this real narrowing of a lot of women opting out of the profession as they ascend up the ranks, which I think is really unfortunate. Since 1987, there are now many more of us as at the higher levels with families, so I think as role models we are encouraging more women to stay within banking and rise up through the ranks. 
 ( Also on POLITICO: Tenacity helps Dixon in GOP ranks) 
 I think what Sheryl Sandberg said about the importance of “leaning in” is very true but it’s not sufficient. Because if you are leaning in to a door that is nailed shut, you are just going to get bloodied and tired of trying to push that door open. So you have got to have the next level, which is, “how do you open up those doors to the ever-bigger roles?” 
 The second point you make is intriguing. Would ’08 have been different had there been different voices around the table? And I think one thing that is encouraging to me is the increase in data that suggest that organizations with a higher percentage of women in the C-suite or boards with a greater number of women or other under-represented minorities are more effective and have greater financial results. 
 Did going into the male-dominated, testosterone-fueled world of Wall Street give you pause? 
 There were enough times even coming up to that point where I was one of very few women. I remember the first time it struck me is I was an econ major at Stanford as an undergrad, and it struck me how few women were econ majors back in the ’70s. And then in business school how few women. … And even then I thought, gosh this is really unfortunate. So when I started here, what was very different was that there were very few women at senior levels, period, and very few that had a family. 
 There were certain things along the way where being a woman was actually intriguingly helpful … When I was a very young associate, I was asked by a managing director to present to a board of directors. … At the time, the CEO had said they needed more women in the boardroom and part of the reason was that they had an R&D focus that was actually pretty nonsensical because it was run by men. … They were having problems with their product development because they didn’t have enough women at the senior-most ranks who could provide an overlay that was quite relevant for their customer base.”

Early life and education[edit]
Porat was born to a Jewish family[4] in Sale, Greater Manchester England,[5] the daughter of Dr. Dan and Frieda Porat.[6][7] She moved at a young age to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where her father was a research fellow in the physics department at Harvard University. Her father later relocated the family to Palo Alto, California where he worked at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for 26 years.[8] Porat has a bachelor of arts degree in Economics & International Relations from Stanford University, and holds a master of science degree in industrial relations from London School of Economics and an MBA with distinction from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[9]
Career[edit]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
Porat started her career at Morgan Stanley in 1987 but left to follow Morgan Stanley President Robert F. Greenhill to Smith Barney in 1993[10] and returned to Morgan Stanley in 1996. Before becoming CFO, she served as Vice Chairman of Investment Banking, from September 2003 to December 2009 and Global Head of the Financial Institutions Group from September 2006 through December 2009. She was previously the co-head of Technology Investment Banking and worked for Morgan Stanley in London.[5] She is credited with creating the European debt financing that saved Amazon from collapse during the dot-com melt down in 2000.[11] Her financial partner during the Internet investment banking craze was Mary Meeker, who is the godmother to Porat's three children.[10]
During the financial crisis, Porat led the Morgan Stanley team advising the United States Department of the Treasury regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank with respect to AIG.[12][13] In the 2011 HBO movie "Too Big to Fail," Porat is played by Jennifer van Dyck.[14] In May 2011, she presented to the Bretton Woods Committee hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. on post-crisis reform and financial legislation, and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, in 2013 on "trust" levels within and of the financial sector.[15][16][17]
In 2013 it was reported that President Barack Obama would nominate Porat as the next Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.[18] However, it was reported later by Bloomberg News and The New York Times that Porat had contacted White House officials to withdraw her name from consideration because of improving conditions at Morgan Stanley and the acrimonious confirmation process inflicted upon then Treasury Secretary-nominee Jack Lew.[19][20]
Porat's career was analyzed in the McKinsey & Company study "How Remarkable Women Lead".[21] She was named "Best Financial Institutions CFO" in a poll conducted by Institutional Investor for its "2014 All-America Executive Team".[22]
Google[edit]
On March 24, 2015 it was announced that Porat would join Google as their new CFO as of May 26, 2015.[1] Bloomberg Business reported that her hiring deal included financial incentives that will eventually amount to $70 million by 2016.[23] She has been credited with boosting Google's share price by reorganizing the Company and imposing financial discipline for the first time.[24]
Boardships[edit]
She is a vice chair of the Board of Trustees of Stanford University,[25] a member of the Board of Directors of Stanford Management Company[26] the Borrowing Advisory Committee of the United States Treasury,[27] the Board of Directors of The Council on Foreign Relations,[5] the Board of Trustees of the Economic Club of New York,[28] and the Bretton Woods Committee.[29] She is a member of the Advisory Council of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution.[30]
Political views[edit]
Porat supported Senator Hillary Clinton when she ran for President in 2008, hosting a fundraiser at her apartment in The Dakota in New York City.[31] In 2011, Porat expressed her support for increased taxes on the wealthy and declared on the topic of significant spending decreases that "we cannot cut our way to greatness."[32]
Personal life[edit]
Porat has been married to Anthony Paduano, partner in the law firm of Paduano & Weintraub, since 1983.[6] Porat is a survivor of breast cancer.[33]

Early life and education[edit]
Porat was born to a Jewish family[4] in Sale, Greater Manchester England,[5] the daughter of Dr. Dan and Frieda Porat.[6][7] She moved at a young age to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where her father was a research fellow in the physics department at Harvard University. Her father later relocated the family to Palo Alto, California where he worked at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for 26 years.[8] Porat has a bachelor of arts degree in Economics & International Relations from Stanford University, and holds a master of science degree in industrial relations from London School of Economics and an MBA with distinction from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[9]
Career[edit]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
Porat started her career at Morgan Stanley in 1987 but left to follow Morgan Stanley President Robert F. Greenhill to Smith Barney in 1993[10] and returned to Morgan Stanley in 1996. Before becoming CFO, she served as Vice Chairman of Investment Banking, from September 2003 to December 2009 and Global Head of the Financial Institutions Group from September 2006 through December 2009. She was previously the co-head of Technology Investment Banking and worked for Morgan Stanley in London.[5] She is credited with creating the European debt financing that saved Amazon from collapse during the dot-com melt down in 2000.[11] Her financial partner during the Internet investment banking craze was Mary Meeker, who is the godmother to Porat's three children.[10]
During the financial crisis, Porat led the Morgan Stanley team advising the United States Department of the Treasury regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank with respect to AIG.[12][13] In the 2011 HBO movie "Too Big to Fail," Porat is played by Jennifer van Dyck.[14] In May 2011, she presented to the Bretton Woods Committee hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. on post-crisis reform and financial legislation, and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, in 2013 on "trust" levels within and of the financial sector.[15][16][17]
In 2013 it was reported that President Barack Obama would nominate Porat as the next Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.[18] However, it was reported later by Bloomberg News and The New York Times that Porat had contacted White House officials to withdraw her name from consideration because of improving conditions at Morgan Stanley and the acrimonious confirmation process inflicted upon then Treasury Secretary-nominee Jack Lew.[19][20]
Porat's career was analyzed in the McKinsey & Company study "How Remarkable Women Lead".[21] She was named "Best Financial Institutions CFO" in a poll conducted by Institutional Investor for its "2014 All-America Executive Team".[22]
Google[edit]
On March 24, 2015 it was announced that Porat would join Google as their new CFO as of May 26, 2015.[1] Bloomberg Business reported that her hiring deal included financial incentives that will eventually amount to $70 million by 2016.[23] She has been credited with boosting Google's share price by reorganizing the Company and imposing financial discipline for the first time.[24]
Boardships[edit]
She is a vice chair of the Board of Trustees of Stanford University,[25] a member of the Board of Directors of Stanford Management Company[26] the Borrowing Advisory Committee of the United States Treasury,[27] the Board of Directors of The Council on Foreign Relations,[5] the Board of Trustees of the Economic Club of New York,[28] and the Bretton Woods Committee.[29] She is a member of the Advisory Council of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution.[30]
Political views[edit]
Porat supported Senator Hillary Clinton when she ran for President in 2008, hosting a fundraiser at her apartment in The Dakota in New York City.[31] In 2011, Porat expressed her support for increased taxes on the wealthy and declared on the topic of significant spending decreases that "we cannot cut our way to greatness."[32]
Personal life[edit]
Porat has been married to Anthony Paduano, partner in the law firm of Paduano & Weintraub, since 1983.[6] Porat is a survivor of breast cancer.[33]

Early life and education[edit]
Porat was born to a Jewish family[4] in Sale, Greater Manchester England,[5] the daughter of Dr. Dan and Frieda Porat.[6][7] She moved at a young age to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where her father was a research fellow in the physics department at Harvard University. Her father later relocated the family to Palo Alto, California where he worked at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for 26 years.[8] Porat has a bachelor of arts degree in Economics & International Relations from Stanford University, and holds a master of science degree in industrial relations from London School of Economics and an MBA with distinction from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[9]
Career[edit]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
Porat started her career at Morgan Stanley in 1987 but left to follow Morgan Stanley President Robert F. Greenhill to Smith Barney in 1993[10] and returned to Morgan Stanley in 1996. Before becoming CFO, she served as Vice Chairman of Investment Banking, from September 2003 to December 2009 and Global Head of the Financial Institutions Group from September 2006 through December 2009. She was previously the co-head of Technology Investment Banking and worked for Morgan Stanley in London.[5] She is credited with creating the European debt financing that saved Amazon from collapse during the dot-com melt down in 2000.[11] Her financial partner during the Internet investment banking craze was Mary Meeker, who is the godmother to Porat's three children.[10]
During the financial crisis, Porat led the Morgan Stanley team advising the United States Department of the Treasury regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank with respect to AIG.[12][13] In the 2011 HBO movie "Too Big to Fail," Porat is played by Jennifer van Dyck.[14] In May 2011, she presented to the Bretton Woods Committee hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. on post-crisis reform and financial legislation, and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, in 2013 on "trust" levels within and of the financial sector.[15][16][17]
In 2013 it was reported that President Barack Obama would nominate Porat as the next Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.[18] However, it was reported later by Bloomberg News and The New York Times that Porat had contacted White House officials to withdraw her name from consideration because of improving conditions at Morgan Stanley and the acrimonious confirmation process inflicted upon then Treasury Secretary-nominee Jack Lew.[19][20]
Porat's career was analyzed in the McKinsey & Company study "How Remarkable Women Lead".[21] She was named "Best Financial Institutions CFO" in a poll conducted by Institutional Investor for its "2014 All-America Executive Team".[22]
Google[edit]
On March 24, 2015 it was announced that Porat would join Google as their new CFO as of May 26, 2015.[1] Bloomberg Business reported that her hiring deal included financial incentives that will eventually amount to $70 million by 2016.[23] She has been credited with boosting Google's share price by reorganizing the Company and imposing financial discipline for the first time.[24]
Boardships[edit]
She is a vice chair of the Board of Trustees of Stanford University,[25] a member of the Board of Directors of Stanford Management Company[26] the Borrowing Advisory Committee of the United States Treasury,[27] the Board of Directors of The Council on Foreign Relations,[5] the Board of Trustees of the Economic Club of New York,[28] and the Bretton Woods Committee.[29] She is a member of the Advisory Council of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution.[30]
Political views[edit]
Porat supported Senator Hillary Clinton when she ran for President in 2008, hosting a fundraiser at her apartment in The Dakota in New York City.[31] In 2011, Porat expressed her support for increased taxes on the wealthy and declared on the topic of significant spending decreases that "we cannot cut our way to greatness."[32]
Personal life[edit]
Porat has been married to Anthony Paduano, partner in the law firm of Paduano & Weintraub, since 1983.[6] Porat is a survivor of breast cancer.[33]

Early life and education[edit]
Porat was born to a Jewish family[4] in Sale, Greater Manchester England,[5] the daughter of Dr. Dan and Frieda Porat.[6][7] She moved at a young age to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where her father was a research fellow in the physics department at Harvard University. Her father later relocated the family to Palo Alto, California where he worked at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for 26 years.[8] Porat has a bachelor of arts degree in Economics & International Relations from Stanford University, and holds a master of science degree in industrial relations from London School of Economics and an MBA with distinction from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[9]
Career[edit]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
Porat started her career at Morgan Stanley in 1987 but left to follow Morgan Stanley President Robert F. Greenhill to Smith Barney in 1993[10] and returned to Morgan Stanley in 1996. Before becoming CFO, she served as Vice Chairman of Investment Banking, from September 2003 to December 2009 and Global Head of the Financial Institutions Group from September 2006 through December 2009. She was previously the co-head of Technology Investment Banking and worked for Morgan Stanley in London.[5] She is credited with creating the European debt financing that saved Amazon from collapse during the dot-com melt down in 2000.[11] Her financial partner during the Internet investment banking craze was Mary Meeker, who is the godmother to Porat's three children.[10]
During the financial crisis, Porat led the Morgan Stanley team advising the United States Department of the Treasury regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank with respect to AIG.[12][13] In the 2011 HBO movie "Too Big to Fail," Porat is played by Jennifer van Dyck.[14] In May 2011, she presented to the Bretton Woods Committee hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. on post-crisis reform and financial legislation, and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, in 2013 on "trust" levels within and of the financial sector.[15][16][17]
In 2013 it was reported that President Barack Obama would nominate Porat as the next Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.[18] However, it was reported later by Bloomberg News and The New York Times that Porat had contacted White House officials to withdraw her name from consideration because of improving conditions at Morgan Stanley and the acrimonious confirmation process inflicted upon then Treasury Secretary-nominee Jack Lew.[19][20]
Porat's career was analyzed in the McKinsey & Company study "How Remarkable Women Lead".[21] She was named "Best Financial Institutions CFO" in a poll conducted by Institutional Investor for its "2014 All-America Executive Team".[22]
Google[edit]
On March 24, 2015 it was announced that Porat would join Google as their new CFO as of May 26, 2015.[1] Bloomberg Business reported that her hiring deal included financial incentives that will eventually amount to $70 million by 2016.[23] She has been credited with boosting Google's share price by reorganizing the Company and imposing financial discipline for the first time.[24]
Boardships[edit]
She is a vice chair of the Board of Trustees of Stanford University,[25] a member of the Board of Directors of Stanford Management Company[26] the Borrowing Advisory Committee of the United States Treasury,[27] the Board of Directors of The Council on Foreign Relations,[5] the Board of Trustees of the Economic Club of New York,[28] and the Bretton Woods Committee.[29] She is a member of the Advisory Council of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution.[30]
Political views[edit]
Porat supported Senator Hillary Clinton when she ran for President in 2008, hosting a fundraiser at her apartment in The Dakota in New York City.[31] In 2011, Porat expressed her support for increased taxes on the wealthy and declared on the topic of significant spending decreases that "we cannot cut our way to greatness."[32]
Personal life[edit]
Porat has been married to Anthony Paduano, partner in the law firm of Paduano & Weintraub, since 1983.[6] Porat is a survivor of breast cancer.[33]

The Wall Street Veteran Who’s Helping Google Get Disciplined

 





By Leena Rao


					Weinberg-Clark Photography 				

					September 12, 2016, 6:30 AM EDT				

CFO Ruth Porat is pushing Google “creatives” to bring their costs under control.
Subfreezing temperatures didn’t stop Ruth Porat from setting out for her beloved spinning class. But black ice kept her from getting there. Early one Sunday in January 2015, Porat slipped and fell near her home on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, shattering her left shoulder blade. After she rushed to an emergency room, doctors told her she would need immediate surgery.
Wrong answer. Porat was the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley 


ms



, whose annual earnings call was two days away. Instead of going under the knife, she went to her office, arm in a sling. Porat refused painkillers, saying they would impair her judgment, and put in two long workdays before the Tuesday morning call.
Only after that did she go in for surgery—driving straight from the office to the hospital. But within days she was back in Midtown Manhattan, explaining the company’s results to Morgan Stanley’s board. “We could all see her hand was very swollen and black and blue,” recalls Hutham Olayan, a senior executive at Saudi conglomerate Olayan Group and a longtime board member. But Porat “was presenting as if nothing had happened.” Porat’s shoulder remained painful for months, but it didn’t keep her from traveling. A few weeks after the accident, she flew to California on a trip that helped her land one of the most prominent and difficult jobs in technology—becoming CFO at Google

A high tolerance for pain isn’t literally a job requirement for most leaders. But over a career at the highest levels in corporate finance, Porat has been equally unflappable, navigating physical obstacles and fighting great metaphorical ­discomfort—the race-the-clock stress of the financial crisis, the tension of negotiations among big-ego executives, and now the culture clash of imposing financial discipline at tech’s biggest idea factory. In doing so, Porat, 58, has the rare distinction of having been one of the most powerful women in both finance and technology—two industries in which women have struggled to reach senior positions.
Porat’s work ethic stands out even by the caffeinated standards of Wall Street. But she far outshines the pack, according to former Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack, in her ability to reason her way through the most difficult financial problems. She matches that analytical rigor with an approachability and warmth that make her a consummate boardroom diplomat. “Ruth is the only person who can deliver bad news to me, and I’ll still like her,” says Jeff Immelt, CEO of GE

.
After nearly 30 years in finance, Porat now calls a different industry her home. At Google, where she started in May 2015, Porat has traded suits and heels for hoodies and jeans. She jumped immediately into the task of restructuring Google under a new corporate umbrella, Alphabet—and showing investors how much the company was earning from and spending on its core search and ads business on the one hand and its “moonshot” projects on the other.

So far she has given shareholders plenty to celebrate. After her first earnings report, in July 2015, Google’s market value increased $60 billion in a single day, the largest such gain ever for a U.S. company. In all, Google’s stock (now Alphabet’s) is up more than 40% since Porat switched to Pacific time. “No normal person could walk into a massive restructuring … with new subsidiaries and compensation and be completely fine,” says Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt, who calls Porat “extraordinary.”
Still, the Alphabet reshuffle is just one step in a long-term transformation, one that puts Porat at the center of a contentious struggle over Google’s future. For all its impressive innovations, from the Android operating system to advances in artificial intelligence, Google still gets about 95% of its revenue from online advertising, and industry watchers believe it will inevitably lose its edge there as rivals grow stronger. “The clock is ticking on Alphabet’s dominance,” says independent technology analyst Rob Enderle. Google needs another hit—ideally from one of the nonadvertising businesses now labeled Other Bets. Inventing the next breakthrough isn’t Porat’s job, but as CFO, she’s the one leaning on the inventors to show results.
Porat led Google’s ­reorganization under the holding company Alphabet last year; since she joined the company in May 2015, its stock price has risen more than 40%.Weinberg-Clark Photography
And that’s where the tension lies. Under Porat’s scrutiny, those business units are facing unprecedented pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenue. Schmidt and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin say such discipline will help Google spot winners more efficiently. But some of the company’s “smart creatives” fear that Alphabet could inadvertently strangle the next great innovation in its infancy, in the name of fiscal prudence.
Porat herself recently told an audience that “you can’t cost cut your way to greatness.” (She declined to speak on the record for this article.) Yet that principle hasn’t stopped the company from cutting, and a recent string of executive departures suggests that some cuts are drawing blood. In short, the hoodie honeymoon phase is over.


Porat’s transition to Silicon Valley was in fact a homecoming. She was born in England, but her family moved to Palo Alto when she was a child, when her father joined Stanford’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Dan Porat, a Holocaust survivor who never earned a high school diploma, became an accomplished physicist who authored more than 40 scientific and technical papers. Frieda Porat, Ruth’s mother, was a psychologist, and Ruth never doubted she would have both a family and a career.
Her love for math and problem solving led Porat to Wall Street. After graduating from Stanford and from business school at Wharton, Porat joined Morgan Stanley as a junior mergers-and-acquisitions banker in 1987. She hit her stride in the mid-1990s after becoming head of Morgan Stanley’s technology banking team, just as Wall Street was growing infatuated with the shiny new Internet.

Porat worked closely with Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley’s influential tech-stock analyst, who’s a confidante to Porat and godmother to her three sons. (Porat and securities lawyer Anthony ­Paduano married in 1983.) At a time when tech analysts tended to be exuberant bulls while bankers were more skeptical, “Ruth was the oil in the machinery” that helped the team agree on which transactions to back, says Joe Perella, then head of Morgan Stanley’s investment banking. Porat and Meeker could be an irresistible sales force, bombarding tech executives with data and ideas to win the right to lead their stock offerings. But Porat also had no problem telling startups to slow down and prove their business models before going public.

Mack eventually promoted Porat to vice chairwoman of investment banking—a job that gave her influence with bigger companies. When Immelt first met Porat, he had just succeeded Jack Welch at GE. “When bankers would visit, they would take the first 30 minutes and tell me Jack Welch stories, like that was supposed to make me feel good,” Immelt recalls. “Ruth never did that.” With Immelt, too, Ruth earned respect by advising against some deals, even when saying yes could have reaped big fees for Morgan Stanley. When GE spun off insurance unit Genworth 


gnw



 in 2004 in a $2.8 billion IPO, Porat pressed Immelt to set the opening share price lower, arguing that the stock would flounder if priced too high. “CEOs hate to hear shit like that,” Immelt says. “But she was right.”
In 2006, Morgan Stanley assigned Porat to its financial institutions banking business, which helped big banks raise capital. That meant she was, in effect, sitting in a lifeguard tower when the financial-crisis tidal wave made landfall. In June 2008, Mack received a call from Hank Paulson, then the Treasury secretary, who was assembling a team to help the ailing mortgage giants Fannie Mae

 and Freddie Mac

. “I need the best minds you have to help figure out what to do,” Paulson told Mack. Mack sent two top bankers, Porat and Bob Scully. When Porat arrived in Washington, Paulson told her, “This is going to be the most exhausting and rewarding thing you ever do.”

“Ruth is the only person who can deliver bad news to me, and I’ll still like her.”
—Jeff Immelt, CEO, GE
Porat and Scully designed a plan to put the two entities under conservatorship, with the feds taking over their management—the only way, Paulson says today, to provide “a very necessary long-term guarantee” to keep the mortgage market liquid. Executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bitterly opposed the move, but it very likely kept the Great Recession from getting even worse. “I can’t tell you how many times Paulson called to thank me for giving him Ruth,” Mack says. Paulson also tapped Porat to help rescue insurance giant AIG

. When she returned home late one night to shower during that ordeal, a former colleague recalls, she found a collage of Post-it notes of support waiting in the kitchen; Porat’s 11-year-old son wrote, “Fix this so I can have my mommy back.”
Porat’s Washington experience helped her earn a promotion to chief financial officer, in January 2010. The ensuing years weren’t great for Morgan Stanley—its profits have lagged since the financial crisis—but Porat earned plaudits for stabilizing its finances and helping it meet government “stress tests.” She also showed a knack for lightening the mood. When the staff would work weekends and nights to prep for earnings reports, for example, Porat would blast pop music and sing along.
 


By late 2014, Porat was ready for a change. She had been considered as a candidate for deputy Treasury secretary but withdrew rather than undergo a banker-bashing confirmation hearing. As a trustee at Stanford, she was making more trips to the West Coast, and colleagues say she felt nostalgia for Palo Alto, where her father still lives.

Mack encouraged Porat to reach out to Bill Campbell, the longtime top adviser to Google and Apple

. One Saturday in February 2015, Porat visited Campbell at his Palo Alto home to talk about a career change. As Campbell later told Fortune (in an interview before his death this April), Porat had one stipulation: She didn’t want another CFO job. Campbell responded, “Well, I have the perfect job for you. How about the CFO of Google?”
What Porat hadn’t known was that Google’s then-CFO, Patrick Pichette, was leaving—and that her work during the financial crisis had impressed Google’s leaders. Porat told Campbell she was intrigued, and word got around fast. Almost immediately after she left Campbell’s house, she got a call from Page’s assistant, setting up a meeting. The courtship was quick too: Less than a month after her visit with Campbell, Porat had a job offer, with stock and bonuses that brought her hiring package to almost $70 million.


Comparing today’s Google to crisis-era Wall Street may sound like comparing a mosquito bite to a heart attack. But even successful executives have nightmares, and at Google those involve the company becoming the next Yahoo or Nokia—tech bellwethers that fell behind as the industry’s landscape changed. That’s why the eventual success of Other Bets innovations matters so much. Investors, too, want assurances that Google’s research is paying off. When the company went public in 2004, Page and Brin publicly declared that Google would never sacrifice long-term goals in response to pressure from shareholders. Twelve years later, with Google one of the world’s most widely owned stocks, the company can no longer say, “Just trust us.”
On Porat’s first day at Google, Page explained to her his vision for a holding-company corporate structure and told Porat that implementing it would be her top priority. In August 2015, three months after Porat had started, she and Page announced the creation of Alphabet. Google became a subsidiary of Alphabet, as did most of its smaller, research-driven units, including connected-home business Nest and Google Fiber, its home broadband initiative. Alphabet now discloses revenue and profits for two categories: Google and Other Bets. The Google bucket includes not only the advertising business but also cloud services and Android. In the second quarter of this year, that bucket accounted for 99.1% of Alphabet’s $21.5 billion in revenue; all the Other Bets, just 0.9%.
Porat’s investor-relations team is explaining Wall Street analysts in 15- to 30-minute “office hours” meetings—standard procedure for many companies but previously unheard-of at Google. “I was shocked when I met Ruth for the first time, and she actually asked our team, ‘What can Alphabet do better?’ ” says Eric Sheridan, managing director of UBS’s Internet and interactive entertainment research group. ­Porat won more investor goodwill in October 2015 by announcing a $5.1 billion stock buyback.

But inside Alphabet, the new order is generating more tension than elation. Porat’s team meets regularly with each Other Bets business, walking them through their units’ spending and earnings, and urging them to make tradeoffs to bring them in line. This is Corporate Finance 101, but it represents a drastic shift—and an uncomfortable one for many project managers. “Ruth is approachable and warm, but she is persistent in what she wants—and she asks direct questions,” says one Google em­ployee, implying that such bluntness is, itself, new.
Current and former employees also say the scrutiny goes hand in hand with the kind of cost cutting companies that aren’t Google have endured for decades. Some cuts are relatively minor: Employees are encouraged to use video conferencing instead of traveling to meetings, for example. But others have deeper strategic implications. One source close to the company says it’s now difficult for Other Bets to get new hires approved. The Bets are also being told to be self-sufficient administratively: They can rely on Alphabet for functions like legal counsel, human resources, and public relations, but only if they pay Alphabet for the services. (One Other Bets subsidiary was billed $500,000 for a year’s worth of PR help.) If these units were independent companies, of course, they’d be shouldering these costs on their own. But within Alphabet, they represent unfamiliar constraints, and for some, a signal that the culture Google was built on—­focusing on innovation over profits—is dissipating.

Google executives reject that assertion. Schmidt, the chairman, acknowledges that the focus is new but says it allows Alphabet to invest more efficiently in its winners. Alphabet has been aggressively hiring engineers for cloud-computing and artificial-intelligence projects, for example. “The cost cutting is real, and it’s the right thing to be done, and it’s driven by [Porat],” Schmidt says. “Before she was there, we had lost discipline.”
But is discipline really the problem? In the most recent quarter, Other Bets lost an ugly $859 million on $185 million in revenue. Still, when you consider that Alphabet generated $7 billion in free cash that quarter, the losses seem like something the company could easily absorb. Cost cutting, says Enderle, the analyst, “is like taking painkillers when you are sick. At some point you are going to have to address what is making you sick.” The real issue at Alphabet, he adds, is that “what they are spending money on isn’t successful.”


Merited or not, Alphabet’s reforms have pushed some managers toward the exits. Nest founder Tony Fadell left in June, not long after telling tech website the Information that “the fiscal-discipline era has now descended upon everything.” (He remains an Alphabet adviser.) Three executives from Google’s self-driving-car unit left in August, as did Bill Maris, founder and head of Google’s venture arm. And there have been reports of an executive shakeup at X, Alphabet’s research lab.

The departures have prompted plentiful chatter around Palo Alto. But having navigated the battles of the financial crisis, Porat knows how to tune out noise. She also has the kind of personal experience that keeps corporate infighting in perspective: She has beaten breast cancer twice and has been in remission since 2003. As Meeker, now a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, puts it, “Don’t underestimate the leadership talent that develops from crisis management.”
That talent has made Porat an important voice for Google, inside the company and out, at a time of momentous change. This past January, at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland, Porat and Schmidt hosted a dinner for European leaders. They decided that Porat would make introductory remarks and then yield the floor to Schmidt. But as Porat began talking, Schmidt realized she was giving a far better speech than he could. “The way she spoke showed she knew Google so well,” he recalls.
For a moment, Schmidt wasn’t sure what to do. But he quickly arrived at an answer: “Just shut up and listen to Ruth.”

Early life and education[edit]
Porat was born to a Jewish family[4] in Sale, Greater Manchester England,[5] the daughter of Dr. Dan and Frieda Porat.[6][7] She moved at a young age to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where her father was a research fellow in the physics department at Harvard University. Her father later relocated the family to Palo Alto, California where he worked at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for 26 years.[8] Porat has a bachelor of arts degree in Economics & International Relations from Stanford University, and holds a master of science degree in industrial relations from London School of Economics and an MBA with distinction from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[9]
Career[edit]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
Porat started her career at Morgan Stanley in 1987 but left to follow Morgan Stanley President Robert F. Greenhill to Smith Barney in 1993[10] and returned to Morgan Stanley in 1996. Before becoming CFO, she served as Vice Chairman of Investment Banking, from September 2003 to December 2009 and Global Head of the Financial Institutions Group from September 2006 through December 2009. She was previously the co-head of Technology Investment Banking and worked for Morgan Stanley in London.[5] She is credited with creating the European debt financing that saved Amazon from collapse during the dot-com melt down in 2000.[11] Her financial partner during the Internet investment banking craze was Mary Meeker, who is the godmother to Porat's three children.[10]
During the financial crisis, Porat led the Morgan Stanley team advising the United States Department of the Treasury regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank with respect to AIG.[12][13] In the 2011 HBO movie "Too Big to Fail," Porat is played by Jennifer van Dyck.[14] In May 2011, she presented to the Bretton Woods Committee hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. on post-crisis reform and financial legislation, and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, in 2013 on "trust" levels within and of the financial sector.[15][16][17]
In 2013 it was reported that President Barack Obama would nominate Porat as the next Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.[18] However, it was reported later by Bloomberg News and The New York Times that Porat had contacted White House officials to withdraw her name from consideration because of improving conditions at Morgan Stanley and the acrimonious confirmation process inflicted upon then Treasury Secretary-nominee Jack Lew.[19][20]
Porat's career was analyzed in the McKinsey & Company study "How Remarkable Women Lead".[21] She was named "Best Financial Institutions CFO" in a poll conducted by Institutional Investor for its "2014 All-America Executive Team".[22]
Google[edit]
On March 24, 2015 it was announced that Porat would join Google as their new CFO as of May 26, 2015.[1] Bloomberg Business reported that her hiring deal included financial incentives that will eventually amount to $70 million by 2016.[23] She has been credited with boosting Google's share price by reorganizing the Company and imposing financial discipline for the first time.[24]
Boardships[edit]
She is a vice chair of the Board of Trustees of Stanford University,[25] a member of the Board of Directors of Stanford Management Company[26] the Borrowing Advisory Committee of the United States Treasury,[27] the Board of Directors of The Council on Foreign Relations,[5] the Board of Trustees of the Economic Club of New York,[28] and the Bretton Woods Committee.[29] She is a member of the Advisory Council of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution.[30]
Political views[edit]
Porat supported Senator Hillary Clinton when she ran for President in 2008, hosting a fundraiser at her apartment in The Dakota in New York City.[31] In 2011, Porat expressed her support for increased taxes on the wealthy and declared on the topic of significant spending decreases that "we cannot cut our way to greatness."[32]
Personal life[edit]
Porat has been married to Anthony Paduano, partner in the law firm of Paduano & Weintraub, since 1983.[6] Porat is a survivor of breast cancer.[33]

Early life and education[edit]
Porat was born to a Jewish family[4] in Sale, Greater Manchester England,[5] the daughter of Dr. Dan and Frieda Porat.[6][7] She moved at a young age to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where her father was a research fellow in the physics department at Harvard University. Her father later relocated the family to Palo Alto, California where he worked at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for 26 years.[8] Porat has a bachelor of arts degree in Economics & International Relations from Stanford University, and holds a master of science degree in industrial relations from London School of Economics and an MBA with distinction from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[9]
Career[edit]
Morgan Stanley[edit]
Porat started her career at Morgan Stanley in 1987 but left to follow Morgan Stanley President Robert F. Greenhill to Smith Barney in 1993[10] and returned to Morgan Stanley in 1996. Before becoming CFO, she served as Vice Chairman of Investment Banking, from September 2003 to December 2009 and Global Head of the Financial Institutions Group from September 2006 through December 2009. She was previously the co-head of Technology Investment Banking and worked for Morgan Stanley in London.[5] She is credited with creating the European debt financing that saved Amazon from collapse during the dot-com melt down in 2000.[11] Her financial partner during the Internet investment banking craze was Mary Meeker, who is the godmother to Porat's three children.[10]
During the financial crisis, Porat led the Morgan Stanley team advising the United States Department of the Treasury regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the New York Federal Reserve Bank with respect to AIG.[12][13] In the 2011 HBO movie "Too Big to Fail," Porat is played by Jennifer van Dyck.[14] In May 2011, she presented to the Bretton Woods Committee hosted by the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. on post-crisis reform and financial legislation, and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, in 2013 on "trust" levels within and of the financial sector.[15][16][17]
In 2013 it was reported that President Barack Obama would nominate Porat as the next Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.[18] However, it was reported later by Bloomberg News and The New York Times that Porat had contacted White House officials to withdraw her name from consideration because of improving conditions at Morgan Stanley and the acrimonious confirmation process inflicted upon then Treasury Secretary-nominee Jack Lew.[19][20]
Porat's career was analyzed in the McKinsey & Company study "How Remarkable Women Lead".[21] She was named "Best Financial Institutions CFO" in a poll conducted by Institutional Investor for its "2014 All-America Executive Team".[22]
Google[edit]
On March 24, 2015 it was announced that Porat would join Google as their new CFO as of May 26, 2015.[1] Bloomberg Business reported that her hiring deal included financial incentives that will eventually amount to $70 million by 2016.[23] She has been credited with boosting Google's share price by reorganizing the Company and imposing financial discipline for the first time.[24]
Boardships[edit]
She is a vice chair of the Board of Trustees of Stanford University,[25] a member of the Board of Directors of Stanford Management Company[26] the Borrowing Advisory Committee of the United States Treasury,[27] the Board of Directors of The Council on Foreign Relations,[5] the Board of Trustees of the Economic Club of New York,[28] and the Bretton Woods Committee.[29] She is a member of the Advisory Council of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution.[30]
Political views[edit]
Porat supported Senator Hillary Clinton when she ran for President in 2008, hosting a fundraiser at her apartment in The Dakota in New York City.[31] In 2011, Porat expressed her support for increased taxes on the wealthy and declared on the topic of significant spending decreases that "we cannot cut our way to greatness."[32]
Personal life[edit]
Porat has been married to Anthony Paduano, partner in the law firm of Paduano & Weintraub, since 1983.[6] Porat is a survivor of breast cancer.[33]
