      Appointment






February 17, 2014 03:15 PM Eastern Standard Time



MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Donaldson Company, Inc. (NYSE:DCI), announced a number of officer 
      changes today which are effective April 1st.
    


Charles J. McMurray, 60, Senior Vice President and Chief 
      Administrative Officer, retires after 33 distinguished years of service. 
      McMurray joined Donaldson in 1980 and has held key management roles in 
      the Company’s operations in the US and Europe and with the Company’s 
      joint venture with Caterpillar. Over McMurray’s career, he also held 
      other senior leadership roles, including Vice President of Human 
      Resources and Senior Vice President of Industrial Products, before 
      assuming his most recent role as Senior Vice President and Chief 
      Administrative Officer with responsibility for Latin America, South 
      Africa, and a number of the Company’s functional groups.
    

      “Charlie has been a key leader in building our Company’s outstanding 
      track record. I would like to thank Charlie for his dedication to the 
      needs of our Company, Customers, Shareholders, and Employees, and his 
      steadfast commitment to operational excellence which will be among the 
      many hallmarks of his Donaldson legacy,” said Bill Cook, CEO.
    

Tod E. Carpenter, 54, is appointed to the Company’s Board of 
      Directors and promoted to Chief Operating Officer (COO) from his current 
      role as Senior Vice President, Engine Products. Carpenter joined 
      Donaldson in 1996. He has held a number of positions including General 
      Manager of Gas Turbine Systems, Vice President of Industrial Filtration 
      Solutions, and Vice President, Europe and Middle East, before assuming 
      his current role. Carpenter has a Bachelor’s Degree in Manufacturing 
      Technology from Indiana State University and an MBA from Long Beach 
      State University.
    

      “Tod brings a wealth of general management and global leadership 
      experience to his new role. His track-record of driving strategic growth 
      initiatives, launching innovative proprietary products, and 
      strengthening relationships with our key global Customers is impressive 
      and prepares him well for the COO role,” said Bill Cook.
    

Thomas R. Scalf, 47, is promoted to Senior Vice President, Engine 
      Products, from his current role as Vice President of Global Industrial 
      Air Filtration. Scalf joined Donaldson in 1989 and has held a number of 
      key roles including Plant Manager in the US and Europe, Director of 
      Operations, and General Manager in the Exhaust and Emissions, Industrial 
      Air Filtration, and Industrial Filtration Solutions businesses before 
      assuming his current role. Scalf earned a Bachelor’s Degree in 
      Industrial Engineering from Iowa State University and an MBA from St. 
      Ambrose College.
    

      “In his current role, Tom has led the highly successful globalization of 
      our Industrial Air Filtration business, championed the dramatic 
      refreshment of our dust collection product line, and posted outstanding 
      revenue growth. He brings a wealth of leadership experience to his new 
      role, where he can build on the success of our Engine Products 
      business,” said Bill Cook.
    

Jeffrey E. Spethmann, 49, is appointed Vice President, Global 
      Industrial Air Filtration. Spethmann is currently the Vice President of 
      our Exhaust and Emissions business unit, a position he has held since 
      returning to Donaldson in 2013. Spethmann’s prior Donaldson experience 
      included a variety of engineering and technology positions from 1988 
      through 1999. From 1999 through 2013, Spethmann held positions of 
      General Manager and then President of Blow Molded Specialties, Inc. and 
      President and CEO of Waltek, Inc. Spethmann holds a Bachelor’s Degree in 
      Mechanical Engineering from the University of Minnesota’s Institute of 
      Technology and an MBA from the University of Minnesota.
    

      “Jeff’s deep operations and technical experience, as well as broad 
      management and strategic perspectives, provided the impressive 
      foundation for his return to Donaldson and will serve him well in his 
      new role,” said Bill Cook.
