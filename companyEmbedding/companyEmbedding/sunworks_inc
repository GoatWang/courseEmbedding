I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!

I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.







SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!







Update: 9/20/16
I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.

Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.







Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.







Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  

The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.

I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. 

I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.







Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!







This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.
The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permit
Inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.







WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  
To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)
Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.







This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!

Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!







This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?







After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   

We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   

The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   

Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.

We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. 

PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!

The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.

Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               

As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.

We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.

The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.

In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!







We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!







After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. 

I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.

After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.

I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.

Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.







I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.







From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  

This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.

I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.







We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. 
Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.

Will update this review after install.







Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.







This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)
I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.
I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.
I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,
and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...
I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.
I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,
through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.
The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.
One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the work
The roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.







Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.







Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.

SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!

Updated review



Update: 9/20/16I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.

Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.

Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.

Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!

This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permitInspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.

WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.

After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!

We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!

After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.

I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.

From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.

We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.Will update this review after install.

Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.

This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the workThe roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.

Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

Rebrands Its Solar Racking System "Rapid Rack"MarketwiredMay 26, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareROSEVILLE, CA--(Marketwired - May 26, 2016) - Sunworks, Inc. (SUNW), a leading provider of solar power solutions, is also a manufacturer of its own solar racking system. The proprietary mounting system (originally purchased from a company in Germany) was recently rebranded as "Rapid Rack", now an American-made product with a name that embodies its main feature: Speed.Solar racking is one of the most important cost items in a solar system. Reducing its cost without surrendering quality is critical for continuing efficiency improvements. Solar installers and EPC's are focused on "installed cost." Management of Sunworks believes that Rapid Rack can reduce the cost of installation by as much as 10%."For the past eight years before joining this team, I sold the top solar racking brands in the market and never have I seen a solar racking solution that can be installed as fast as Rapid Rack," commented Robert Lopez, V.P. of Sales and Marketing for Rapid Rack. "In a market filled with competition you must either be better or be different. Rapid Rack is both!"Speed is not the only thing that sets Rapid Rack apart. This solar mounting system is constructed using high-quality, corrosion-resistant materials, and built-in wire management. These qualities enable Rapid Rack to be the most aesthetically pleasing solar mounts, as well as the fastest and most durable, according to Lopez.Rapid Rack has been used on hundreds of MW's of installations all over the world, and is currently a racking system of choice in the rapidly growing solar market in Mexico. This success abroad has led to the company's need for an international website that is slated to be released in early June.Rapid Rack (formerly known as Universal Racking Solutions) has just launched its new and improved website www.rapidrack.com. The site will allow solar contractors to download technical and instructional documents, and also gives potential clients access to new media and FAQ's."The product advancement of Rapid Rack is one more way that we are able to use innovation to drive down the cost of solar installations and expand our influence to make solar energy affordable," concludes Jim Nelson, CEO of Sunworks, Inc. "While the costs of solar systems have steadily decreased over the years, we have visibility into continued efficiency gains through product and process improvement."About Sunworks, Inc.Sunworks, (formerly known as Solar3D) a leading provider of solar power solutions, is focused on the design, installation and management of solar power systems for commercial, agricultural and residential customers. Sunworks is one of the fastest growing solar systems providers in the western United States, delivering 2.5 kilowatt to multi-megawatt commercial systems. The Company's mission is to further the widespread adoption of solar power by deploying affordable, state-of-the-art systems and developing breakthrough new solar technologies. The Company's focus is on putting the customer first, providing the best value systems in the industry, and delivering on what is promised.To learn more about Sunworks, visit our website at http://sunworksusa.com/.Safe Harbor StatementMatters discussed in this press release contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!

I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.







SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!







Update: 9/20/16
I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.

Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.







Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.







Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  

The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.

I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. 

I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.







Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!







This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.
The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permit
Inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.







WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  
To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)
Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.







This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!

Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!







This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?







After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   

We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   

The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   

Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.

We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. 

PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!

The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.

Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               

As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.

We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.

The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.

In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!







We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!







After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. 

I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.

After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.

I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.

Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.







I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.







From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  

This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.

I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.







We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. 
Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.

Will update this review after install.







Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.







This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)
I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.
I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.
I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,
and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...
I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.
I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,
through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.
The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.
One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the work
The roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.







Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.







Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.

SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!

Updated review



Update: 9/20/16I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.

Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.

Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.

Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!

This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permitInspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.

WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.

This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!

This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?

After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!

We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!

After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.

I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.

From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.

We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.Will update this review after install.

Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.

This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the workThe roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.

Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!

I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.







SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!







Update: 9/20/16
I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.

Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.







Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.







Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  

The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.

I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. 

I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.







Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!







This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.
The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permit
Inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.







WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  
To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)
Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.







This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!

Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!







This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?







After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   

We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   

The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   

Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.

We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. 

PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!

The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.

Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               

As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.

We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.

The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.

In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!







We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!







After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. 

I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.

After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.

I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.

Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.







I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.







From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  

This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.

I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.







We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. 
Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.

Will update this review after install.







Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.







This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)
I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.
I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.
I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,
and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...
I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.
I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,
through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.
The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.
One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the work
The roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.







Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.







Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.

Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!

This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permitInspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.

WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.

This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!

This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?

After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!

We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!

After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.

I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.

From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.

We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.Will update this review after install.

Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.

This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the workThe roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.

Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!

I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.







SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!







Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!







My wife and I had spent a couple of years talking with different companies, to get an idea of what would fit our needs for going solar. At first we were left a little confused by how the plans varied and also by the outlandish quotes we received, and had given up looking at solar. But with the continuing higher bills we were paying to PG&E, we decided to re-evaluate going solar. About this same time, we heard an ad for SUNworks Solar on our local radio station. We scheduled an appointment with SUNworks and they explained everything, from what our needs were, by comparing our yearly usage, to how the equipment worked and ideas of how to finance it. We were very happy with their proposal, the installation was neat and professional, and we have been enjoying seeing what we save each month since April of 2015. Sure, you give up one bill for another, but our payments are a lot less than the monthly utility bill was, and the system will be paid for in a few years. I would recommend going with SUNworks Solar to my friends.







WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  
To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)
Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.







We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!







We worked with Jose to get our solar completed from start to finish. Everything was explained clearly and the install was completed without any problems. We are very happy with the service from Sunworks and love not having an electricity bill!







Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.







Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  

The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.

I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. 

I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.







I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.







After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   

We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   

The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   

Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.

We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. 

PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!

The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.

Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               

As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.

We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.

The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.

In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!







From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  

This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.

I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.







We interviewed 5 different solar companies and decided to go with Sunworks due to the high quality equipment and the comprehensive 25 year warranty.  Within a few days of us signing the contract, the engineer came out to do the site inspection.  We had drawings to approve within a week and two weeks later the crew was out installing the system.  The crew was very professional and friendly.  They were very careful to not damage anything around the house and did a beautiful job routing the conduit so that it was not too noticeable.  I have worked with contractors and construction my whole life and this team was one of the most impressive I have ever encountered.  Would highly recommend them!







I would also like to extend my gratitude and pleasure in dealing with all areas of the SunWorks team. This includes Tony in sales, the installation team (the whole team was prompt and professional), the office clerical, and Vince in Technical support. SunWorks has delivered on every and all aspects of work and has shown true professionalism in all areas. I found it hard to believe that SunWorks did not try to take advantage of me or attempt to insult my integrity. In this day and age to find a local company that has the most competitive pricing as well as covering the cost of material and installation with no down payment until the project is complete, is just remarkable. In our geographic location our homeowners association is not the easiest to comply with and there were NO hickups along the way. We are producing power and our first electric PG&E bill was $0000, during stormy weather. Fantastic is the only word I can use to describe SunWorks!!!! 

I would like this E-mail to be forwarded to the individuals that were involved with our Solar system as well as the SunWorks management team and owners. To say that I am a satisfied customer is truly an understatement. You guys are great and I will forward this E-mail to YELP and the BBB (Better Business Buearu).







This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!

Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!







Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.







We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. 
Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.

Will update this review after install.







Excellent experience from beginning to end.  The communication with my sales rep (Trever Mickelson) exceeded my expectations.  The installation was on time and accommodated my adjustment requests.  When inspected, the words from the inspector were "One of the cleanest solar installs I've ever seen".  I've referred them to several friends and family all of who have been pleased with their experience.  Happy customer :-)







SunWorks is a great solar company. They are honest, responsive, offer great products, offer a solid 25 year warranty  and offer the best value of any solar company I had quote. You must have them quote your solar job or else you will be leaving thousands of dollars on the table!!







SUNworks was a great experience for our family. We decided to go with them after comparing them with several competitors. (And I have to say, their quote was FAR more reasonable than at least one of their top competitors, so be sure to do your due diligence!) From the sales process all the way to the team of experienced install technicians, (who installed my 6 kilowatt system in just a few hours) we thought the team was extremely knowledgeable and professional. It's been six months since our install, and I've been tracking the data and comparing it to the ROI estimates from their sales team. Somewhat to my surprise, (since I know how sales teams operate) their estimates were VERY on-target. Highly recommended!

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.

SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!

Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!

My wife and I had spent a couple of years talking with different companies, to get an idea of what would fit our needs for going solar. At first we were left a little confused by how the plans varied and also by the outlandish quotes we received, and had given up looking at solar. But with the continuing higher bills we were paying to PG&E, we decided to re-evaluate going solar. About this same time, we heard an ad for SUNworks Solar on our local radio station. We scheduled an appointment with SUNworks and they explained everything, from what our needs were, by comparing our yearly usage, to how the equipment worked and ideas of how to finance it. We were very happy with their proposal, the installation was neat and professional, and we have been enjoying seeing what we save each month since April of 2015. Sure, you give up one bill for another, but our payments are a lot less than the monthly utility bill was, and the system will be paid for in a few years. I would recommend going with SUNworks Solar to my friends.

WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.

We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!

Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.

I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.

After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!

From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.

We interviewed 5 different solar companies and decided to go with Sunworks due to the high quality equipment and the comprehensive 25 year warranty.  Within a few days of us signing the contract, the engineer came out to do the site inspection.  We had drawings to approve within a week and two weeks later the crew was out installing the system.  The crew was very professional and friendly.  They were very careful to not damage anything around the house and did a beautiful job routing the conduit so that it was not too noticeable.  I have worked with contractors and construction my whole life and this team was one of the most impressive I have ever encountered.  Would highly recommend them!

I would also like to extend my gratitude and pleasure in dealing with all areas of the SunWorks team. This includes Tony in sales, the installation team (the whole team was prompt and professional), the office clerical, and Vince in Technical support. SunWorks has delivered on every and all aspects of work and has shown true professionalism in all areas. I found it hard to believe that SunWorks did not try to take advantage of me or attempt to insult my integrity. In this day and age to find a local company that has the most competitive pricing as well as covering the cost of material and installation with no down payment until the project is complete, is just remarkable. In our geographic location our homeowners association is not the easiest to comply with and there were NO hickups along the way. We are producing power and our first electric PG&E bill was $0000, during stormy weather. Fantastic is the only word I can use to describe SunWorks!!!! I would like this E-mail to be forwarded to the individuals that were involved with our Solar system as well as the SunWorks management team and owners. To say that I am a satisfied customer is truly an understatement. You guys are great and I will forward this E-mail to YELP and the BBB (Better Business Buearu).

This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!

Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.Will update this review after install.

Excellent experience from beginning to end.  The communication with my sales rep (Trever Mickelson) exceeded my expectations.  The installation was on time and accommodated my adjustment requests.  When inspected, the words from the inspector were "One of the cleanest solar installs I've ever seen".  I've referred them to several friends and family all of who have been pleased with their experience.  Happy customer :-)

SunWorks is a great solar company. They are honest, responsive, offer great products, offer a solid 25 year warranty  and offer the best value of any solar company I had quote. You must have them quote your solar job or else you will be leaving thousands of dollars on the table!!

SUNworks was a great experience for our family. We decided to go with them after comparing them with several competitors. (And I have to say, their quote was FAR more reasonable than at least one of their top competitors, so be sure to do your due diligence!) From the sales process all the way to the team of experienced install technicians, (who installed my 6 kilowatt system in just a few hours) we thought the team was extremely knowledgeable and professional. It's been six months since our install, and I've been tracking the data and comparing it to the ROI estimates from their sales team. Somewhat to my surprise, (since I know how sales teams operate) their estimates were VERY on-target. Highly recommended!

Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.







Update: 9/20/16
I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.

Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.







This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?







So here is the deal. When a sales person comes out to your house and gives you a price and also offers different financing solutions you should be able to take them at their word. So when their sales person gave us the price and financing numbers I called back a couple days later and told the sales person that I was ready to do the deal. Instantly he told me that the financing would not work because work we would not be borrowing enough. Didn't he know that when he told us about it? I gave him another chance because he said he had other financing things we could do. I told him that the monthly cost better not go up or we would not do the deal. The next day I received an email with the new terms. While the monthly "cost" went down, it went from a 15 year note to a 20 year note and the price went up $2000 because we had "fees" to pay for now. So to all you sales people out there, if you want to sell the job, don't do the old bait and switch thing.







The initial process went fairly smooth. Sunworks was vary quick to respond to my questions and complete the installation. The installation was completed in a day. The crew was friendly and competent. Unfortunately they did leave a mess of insulation in my home that had fallen from the Attic. That's unfortunately when the customer service stopped. I have been attempting to nail down my inspection and enrolment in the net metering program for over 5 weeks now. I kept getting the same story about operations calling me back with all my answers from Scott Feuerherm. The responses were a little slow at first. Now he appears to stop responding all together. It's been 5 days since I last made contact and have had no response. At this point I am happy to return the 20k system and deal with someone who gives a crap about completing the contract. Just because they have received a check doesn't mean the job is complete. Get your act together sunworks.







After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. 

I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.

After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.

I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.

Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.







I have a No soliciting sign next to my front door. They still rang my doorbell and pushed a flyer through the Crack around the door. A company that doesn't respect a homeowner's right to not be bombarded at home will never get my business and I have already told my friends. Will never use this company or give a referral to them.







I received a knock on my door one evening to see if I was interested in solar. I am, so I scheduled an appointment with the salesman at my door for him to come give me an estimate. They called me to re-schedule that appointment because they had double booked. I understand, so I rescheduled. They they called me again to reschedule that appointment because they had "something else come up". Obviously I wasn't a priority, so I didn't reschedule again. About 2 months later, I received a call from a "Manager" who was sorry that it previously didn't work out. He asked if I would allow them to come back out and give me "an offer I couldn't refuse". I was hesitant, but gave them another opportunity. Well, they canceled that appointment the day before they were supposed to be there. Customer service is clearly not their strong suit. Seems silly to review a company that I've never done business with, but they've gone out of their way to waste my time.







SUNworks Solar delivers a bad customer service, their management is greedy & unprofessional. My friends also shared with me their unpleasant experience while trying to buy a solar system for their home from Sunworks; being older folks, they don't care to leave a negative feedback online, they just sent Sunworks team their way & found a better company to buy a solar system from. I got quotes from a number of solar companies before making a choice & this wasn't the company I chose or can recommend anyone to deal with.







Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.







This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.
The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permit
Inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.







This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)
I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.
I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.
I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,
and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...
I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.
I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,
through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.
The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.
One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the work
The roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.







I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!

I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.







SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!







Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!







My wife and I had spent a couple of years talking with different companies, to get an idea of what would fit our needs for going solar. At first we were left a little confused by how the plans varied and also by the outlandish quotes we received, and had given up looking at solar. But with the continuing higher bills we were paying to PG&E, we decided to re-evaluate going solar. About this same time, we heard an ad for SUNworks Solar on our local radio station. We scheduled an appointment with SUNworks and they explained everything, from what our needs were, by comparing our yearly usage, to how the equipment worked and ideas of how to finance it. We were very happy with their proposal, the installation was neat and professional, and we have been enjoying seeing what we save each month since April of 2015. Sure, you give up one bill for another, but our payments are a lot less than the monthly utility bill was, and the system will be paid for in a few years. I would recommend going with SUNworks Solar to my friends.







WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  
To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)
Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.







We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!







We worked with Jose to get our solar completed from start to finish. Everything was explained clearly and the install was completed without any problems. We are very happy with the service from Sunworks and love not having an electricity bill!







Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

I have a No soliciting sign next to my front door. They still rang my doorbell and pushed a flyer through the Crack around the door. A company that doesn't respect a homeowner's right to not be bombarded at home will never get my business and I have already told my friends. Will never use this company or give a referral to them.

I received a knock on my door one evening to see if I was interested in solar. I am, so I scheduled an appointment with the salesman at my door for him to come give me an estimate. They called me to re-schedule that appointment because they had double booked. I understand, so I rescheduled. They they called me again to reschedule that appointment because they had "something else come up". Obviously I wasn't a priority, so I didn't reschedule again. About 2 months later, I received a call from a "Manager" who was sorry that it previously didn't work out. He asked if I would allow them to come back out and give me "an offer I couldn't refuse". I was hesitant, but gave them another opportunity. Well, they canceled that appointment the day before they were supposed to be there. Customer service is clearly not their strong suit. Seems silly to review a company that I've never done business with, but they've gone out of their way to waste my time.

SUNworks Solar delivers a bad customer service, their management is greedy & unprofessional. My friends also shared with me their unpleasant experience while trying to buy a solar system for their home from Sunworks; being older folks, they don't care to leave a negative feedback online, they just sent Sunworks team their way & found a better company to buy a solar system from. I got quotes from a number of solar companies before making a choice & this wasn't the company I chose or can recommend anyone to deal with.

Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.

This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permitInspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.

This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the workThe roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.

SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!

Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!

My wife and I had spent a couple of years talking with different companies, to get an idea of what would fit our needs for going solar. At first we were left a little confused by how the plans varied and also by the outlandish quotes we received, and had given up looking at solar. But with the continuing higher bills we were paying to PG&E, we decided to re-evaluate going solar. About this same time, we heard an ad for SUNworks Solar on our local radio station. We scheduled an appointment with SUNworks and they explained everything, from what our needs were, by comparing our yearly usage, to how the equipment worked and ideas of how to finance it. We were very happy with their proposal, the installation was neat and professional, and we have been enjoying seeing what we save each month since April of 2015. Sure, you give up one bill for another, but our payments are a lot less than the monthly utility bill was, and the system will be paid for in a few years. I would recommend going with SUNworks Solar to my friends.

WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.

We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!

Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!







Update: 9/20/16
I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.

Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.







Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.







Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  

The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.

I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. 

I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.







Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!







This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.
The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permit
Inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.







WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  
To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)
Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.







This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!

Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!







This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?







After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   

We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   

The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   

Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.

We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. 

PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!

The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.

Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               

As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.

We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.

The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.

In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!







We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!







After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. 

I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.

After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.

I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.

Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.







I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.







From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  

This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.

I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.







We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. 
Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.

Will update this review after install.







Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.







This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)
I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.
I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.
I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,
and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...
I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.
I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,
through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.
The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.
One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the work
The roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.







Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.







Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.

SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!

Updated review



Update: 9/20/16I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.

Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.

Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.

Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!

This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permitInspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.

WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.

This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!

This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?

After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!

We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!

After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.

I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.

From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.

We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.Will update this review after install.

Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.

This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the workThe roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.

Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!

I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.







Update: 9/20/16
I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.

Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.







Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.







Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  

The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.

I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. 

I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.







Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!







This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.
The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permit
Inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.







WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  
To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)
Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.







This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!

Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!







This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?







After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   

We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   

The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   

Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.

We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. 

PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!

The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.

Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               

As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.

We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.

The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.

In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!







We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!







After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. 

I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.

After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.

I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.

Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.







I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.







From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  

This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.

I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.







We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. 
Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.

Will update this review after install.







Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.







This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)
I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.
I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.
I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,
and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...
I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.
I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,
through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.
The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.
One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the work
The roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.







Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.







Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!

Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.

Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!

This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permitInspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.

WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.

This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!

This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?

After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!

We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!

After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.

I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.

From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.

We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.Will update this review after install.

Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.

This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the workThe roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.

Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!

I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.







SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!







Update: 9/20/16
I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.

Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.







Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  

The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.

I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. 

I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.







Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!







This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.
The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permit
Inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.







WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  
To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)
Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.







This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!

Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!







This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?







After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   

We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   

The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   

Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.

We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. 

PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!

The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.

Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               

As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.

We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.

The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.

In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!







We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!







After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. 

I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.

After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.

I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.

Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.







I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.







From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  

This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.

I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.







We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. 
Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.

Will update this review after install.







Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.







This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)
I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.
I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.
I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,
and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...
I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.
I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,
through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.
The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.
One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the work
The roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.







Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.







Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.

SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!

Updated review



Update: 9/20/16I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.

Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.

Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!

This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permitInspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.

WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.

This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!

This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?

After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!

We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!

After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.

I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.

From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.

We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.Will update this review after install.

Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.

This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the workThe roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.

Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!

I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.







SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!







Update: 9/20/16
I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.

Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.







Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.







Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  

The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.

I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. 

I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.







Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!







This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.
The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permit
Inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.







WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  
To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)
Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.







This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!

Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!







This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?







After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   

We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   

The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   

Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.

We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. 

PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!

The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.

Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               

As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.

We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.

The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.

In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!







We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!







After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. 

I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.

After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.

I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.

Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.







I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.







From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  

This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.

I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.







We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. 
Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.

Will update this review after install.







Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.







This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)
I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.
I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.
I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,
and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...
I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.
I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,
through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.
The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.
One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the work
The roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.







Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.







Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.

Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!

This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permitInspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.

WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.

This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!

This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?

After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!

We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!

After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.

I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.

From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.

We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.Will update this review after install.

Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.

This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the workThe roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.

Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!

I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.







SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!







Update: 9/20/16
I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.

Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.







Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.







Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  

The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.

I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. 

I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.







Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!







This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.
The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permit
Inspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.







WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  
To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)
Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.







This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!

Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!







This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?







After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   

We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   

The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   

Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.

We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. 

PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!

The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.

Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               

As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.

We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.

The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.

In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!







We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!







After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. 

I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.

After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.

I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.

Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.







I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.







From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  

This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.

I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.







We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. 
Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.

Will update this review after install.







Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.







This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)
I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.
I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.
I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,
and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...
I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.
I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,
through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.
The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.
One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the work
The roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.







Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.







Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.

I put our inquiry for a newPV system out to bid using 'Energy Sage.'  After reviewing 4 competitive bids,I chose Sunworks because their salesperson was extremely engaged, informed and flexible.  He helped us identify local financing for our system, facilitated the loan application, and drove rapid installation of our 5.7 kw system (5 weeks from date our deal was signed until installers arrived to take down my 14 year-old system and install all new racking, inverter and panels in 6 hours!I could go on and on with praise for this entire company's commitment, availability and professionalism.  Short story - I give highest possible recommendation that you consider selecting this company to install a PV system for you.

SunWorks, have installed a 16 panel Solar Roof in early December 2016.  The YTD PG&E savings have met the original Agreement Projections, and have been as expected a great savings from the typical monthly Billings, from PG&E etc... The original installation was fantastic, and we are very grateful to Emil the SunWorks President for his efforts, to assure a great Customer experience, for our family home here in Rocklin.. We would like a big shout OUT to Aspen, the DOO at Sunworks too for making the agreement and business side of the transaction, very pleasant, and transparent...Keep Rockin SunWorks!!!

Updated review



Update: 9/20/16I was going to build a pool with a small down payment and decided to go with panels first with that down. As I said below salesman was very informative on his first visit and mentioned they had great financing "options" which I told him I'd need financing. Months later as I have become more serious and prepping financially to start the panels job he seemed to have forgot my need for financing and when it came down to it I was only given one financing option which I was told I'd need my house to "NOT BE IN A TRUST" and if it was I'd have to get a lawyer and switch it. Not sure if that is the norm but that is not a great option for me. I've decided to not go with this company and will be looking elsewhere as I save my money.Salesperson was very informative on first visit but subsequent emails were answered late in first occasion and second occasion Kris never responded to my emailed questions over 9 days ago. Not good service and I haven't even had any work done yet. Not a good sign. I'll be looking at other solar companies if this is the method of operation they use.

Vultures. I went to a home show TWO DAYS AGO. I am very interested in solar, but I am a teacher, and I'm not available to do a project until this summer. I explained this to them at the booth, and they wrote down that I wouldn't be able to do this until June. I got a call from this company TODAY, asking me if I wanted to move up the date. Seriously? I spoke to many solar companies at this home show. The others seem to be respectful of my job responsibilities and timeline. You just helped me cross one off of my list.

Purchased our solar panels from Mike Del Vecchio, who was a great guy and went around our schedule to go over everything.  Mike did a great job explaining the different types of panels available and hitting it home with the industry leading warranty of 25 years that covers everything.  He even helped us setup and deal with the financing aspect.  The install crew showed up 30 minutes early and finished 4 hours early!  They were all super nice guys who were prompt, courteous and were even able to hide the power cable in our wall so there is nothing extra on the exterior of our house.I live in an area with HOA and SunWorks took care of all the paperwork, permitting and filing.  All we had to do was make sure we were home when the inspectors and SMUD came by.  Communication throughout the project was top notch, and it started at the very beginning. I highly recommend SunWorks if you are looking to get into solar, they have the best warranty, the best panels (half the amount required for the same output that others supply) and just a top notch team to deal with in all facets.

Great service from start to finish.  I met with several companies - Sunworks offered competitive pricing, a great warranty and installed in under three weeks. Communication from our sales person and our account manager about the installation process was great so there were no surprises. On the day of our install the workers arrived on time at 8A,  did a great job communicating and confirming the details of what they would be doing, got the team working almost immediately, did a walk through when the work was completed to show us our new equipment, had the site cleaned and were done by 2P.  Impressive!

This process was pretty easy and well done. Everyone including sales, installation and customer service, were very professional.The only reason for not granting 5 stars as there was some poor and/or mis-communication regarding the permitInspection which cause a bit of frustration and delay.

WOW!  Fantastic purchase!  We leased our system in our old house, but this time we purchased, as the costs would be much better in the long run.  We selected Sunworks because they were local, used highest quality American-Made panels, were able to carefully listen to our needs, and were very reasonably priced.  Others are cheaper, but they use lower quality parts... no thanks!  Tino LaConte in the Sunworks design center in Rocklin held our hands throughout the entire process, especially when we had hiccups in the financing (we had just bought the house!).  To top it off, the install team was fantastic.  They also carefully listened to my needs as I wanted the system to be nearly invisible... they delivered!!!!  If I don't tell my friends I have a solar system, they wouldn't even see it!  All the internal components were placed right where I requested.  We could not be more pleased!  I have recommended SunWorks to all my friends.  We wholeheartedly recommend them!  Now we have electricity from the Sun, and not from country that doesn't like us! (Some traditional electricity is still made by burning oil!)Ask for Tino, that gentleman really takes the time to explain the process.

This company is absolutely fantastic, I have nothing but the best things to say about them. They use the best products, they have been in business much longer than their competitors, and their warranty is second to no one. I was so impressed with the company, I asked if they had any jobs available!Unfortunately, I had to cancel at the last minute, due to a family crisis. Up until this point, I was extremely impressed with everything. I would highly recommend calling the sales rep Tino, he was awesome!

This company offers solar systems but they also offer deceptive advertising practices. I signed up to meet with a representative who came to the house and pitched their pitch. We opted not to proceed with their quote but three months later we are still waiting for the $50 gift card promised to all kept appointments during that promotion. Hindsight being what it is, I'm glad we didn't move forward with them because if they can't keep that easy promise, who knows what else they will fail on?

After reading the reviews I cannot believe we are talking about the same company.   We were given a presentation at the showroom in Roseville.  It was excellent.   After going home and thinking about it overnight and we came back the next day to start our project.   The cost for the solar that we were given at the presentation is the cost that we financed and nothing changed from the beginning to the end of the project.   Installation was within the same week.   The crew from Sunworks were all very professional and when they left there wasn't any debris left behind.   The inspection was done the next day and we were online.  A Sunwork employee was here for the inspection.We were kept well informed of every step by either a phone call or email. PG&E gave us the PTO (Permit to Operate) quicker then expected.   Of course we haven't received our first PG&E billing but with the amount of energy our panels are generating we expect to be very pleased.   Our meter is running BACKWARDS!!!!The sales team of Tino and Jose by Blue Oaks were excellent.  Their presentation was very professional and easy to understand.Aspen in the Winding Creek office answered many of our questions regarding the tax credit benefit as it can be a bit confusing.               As a team from the sales people to operations to their Vice President of sales and marketing, (who I am sorry to say I can't remember his name),  they are all top in their field.We had gotten estimate from another highly recommended solar company but Sunworks said we needed less panels then the other company.   Therefore less cost.   Also Sunworks panels are made in America which was a factor in our decision.The situation at Sun City Lincoln Hills was not in Sunworks control   Billy Casper who owns the golf course made the decision of where to place panels.   However, it is my understanding that after pressure from property owners the golf course will be relocating the panels so as not to block residences views.In closing I have a very happy neighbor who got the referral fee for our installation!

We just received notice for PGE that we could turn on our system!  We had many presentations from many providers and ended up choosing Sunworks.  For us, it was absolutely the write decision.  From the beginning Brent Baker and Shirley Montalvo did a great job explaining their system and why it was the best.  From there, the communications from Yolanda and the rest of the team has been amazing.  The installation team was on time and they left our home neat and clean.  I highly recommend using them.  Now we can just sit back and watch the meter spin in reverse!

After meeting with numerous solar installers, we ultimately chose Sunworks. We were impressed with the salesperson and it seemed that they had a process that would make the whole ordeal seamless and fairly painless. I was surprised that they were ready to install the system within days of signing the contract, rather than the weeks we were told. Installation took two days due to our steep roof. The installers were mostly polite, but they did trample and destroy one of our blueberry plants.After installation, we were supposed to be contacted within days to set up an inspection under the permit process. We were never contacted. My husband discovered a permit packet on the system several weeks later. Then we received the bill. I contacted sunworks to find out why we had not been contacted for the inspection, and why we have not been contacted to sign the required PG&E paperwork or to learn about monitoring. The woman asked me to scan and email her the permit from the packet. I did so by the next day. We never heard from her in acknowledgement of receipt. My husband emailed her again to follow up and request acknowledgment of receipt. Again, she never responded.I have now called sunworks directly and their records show that they are still waiting on this permit I emailed weeks ago. At this point, we have paid over twenty thousand dollars for a system but are not getting the benefit we were promised and relied upon in going with this company. We do, however, have a ruined blueberry plant.Also: a coworker referred this company to us, and, despite the fact that we mentioned it several times, she was apparently not listed as our referral to get her promised referral bonus. This company clearly has a problem with follow through once they've received your money.

I went with the local solar installer. Was very satisfied with the sales rep Tony, office staff kept me informed and the install crew was terrific. Did exactly what was promised. Roseville electric informed us we now have the biggest system in Roseville. Got our rebate and all of the mpower paperwork was done for us. We went with 46 solar panels and the credits in March and April paid our garbage, water, and sewer bill too! Have had the system installed since September, no issues. I would highly recommend Sunworks. Have referred 2 friends since, they had the same experience with Sunworks.

From the first meeting with Sherridan, I knew this company would be great to work with.  She had answers to all my questions and made me feel that she knew her product.  Once the design team had a layout ready, the install happened quickly.  There was a small change made at regarding panel placement, but it didn't delay the install.  Because of the change, they had to submit the new plans to the county.  This is where the only hiccup occurred.  As is typical with government, the county sat on the new plans for a while.  I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I contacted Sherridan.  She referred me to customer service.  I spoke with Adriana, who got to the cause of the delay right away.  From there, it was about a week and we were connected to PG&E.  Now we are enjoying our new solar system.I highly recommend this company.  They take good care of their customers, do great work and sell a great product.

We were referred to SUNworks from a friend who just had solar installed. Haven't gotten it installed yet, but met with the sales rep tonight (Jose Alvarez) and we were pleasantly surprised with his presentation and honesty. Love how quickly we were able to get an appointment, and that they work late hours. We have an appointment next week for a guy to check out the roofs integrity and will get a more thorough estimate on how much our system will be. Love the fact that we will get $1000 for any body we refer... And love that we are getting a kindle as a monitor for the solar. Also love that a new roof is being included in our financing.Will update this review after install.

Their price is not low, but willing to match to certain degree. Initial pricing was ok from Trever, but the later communication is an issue from Karina/Adriana. They do not respond in email"s" and you'll have to call to catch them. They said it takes about a week to draw up the plan and I have not heard a thing in passed 10 days, even with couple email inquiries.

This review is for the South Bay Area Team! (San Jose)I have gone round and round with more than a dozen solar companies.I was so tired of all the run around with sales departments, I decided to go a slightly different route. like lots of people I wanted the best overall deal. I decided to go with an energy broker.I used Your Energy Ally. I did my deal through them. They then shop around for your needs,and provide one of the best competitive prices without haggling.. With that said...I Just finished with my solar installation. These guys were fast, friendly, and on time.I purchased a 6.21 kw system. Not a lease. Within a week after giving them my deposit,through my energy broker, I had all the permits in place, product ordered, and a schedule for the installation. Due to the volume of people getting solar, it was scheduled for a month away. A week later, I got a call from the main office, telling me of a cancellation, asking if I would like to be scheduled 2 weeks earlier. I jumped at the opportunity. They told us 2 days to install.The 1st day they had done more than 80 % of the work by noon. They came back the following day, and had it finished within a couple of hours!. PG&E inspected 2 days later for final approval! I now am enjoying all the benefits of a commercial solar system for my residence.One last item. The installation looks beautiful. The attention to the details shows in the workThe roof panels, the inverter installation, the conduit runs in the attic, everything is looks and functions great.

Wanted to have our system up and running for sometime before reviewing SunWorks. When we decided to consider putting in a solar system we got estimates and talked to 3 other companies before ultimately choosing to go with Sunworks.  SunWorks  bid was not only the best price of the others before the rebates and specials but also they were able to get the system installed sooner as well. We live in a community with an HOA and SunWorks handled the permitting for the HOA and the city. The installation crew were professional and quick. The data line for the inverter was the only thing that was installed wrong and it was resolved. We got the incentive from their advertised special as well as the SMUD rebate quickly. I have since called them twice. Once for a data outage that was caused by the company that hosts the inverter software and once to verify the solar output and both times they have been very helpful. I would recommend them to anyone.

Had sun works install my system in stockton a few months ago.got the e20 panel and didn't need that many to get the power I needes. The install was only 4-5 hours. A clean install and now I can monitor the power I make. The low profile panels look good. Very happy with the service and feed back for all my questions.
