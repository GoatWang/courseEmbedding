About Us
Mission & Vision




                                BITOPI Group :
                            

                                Bitopi was founded in 1968 by a young ambitious man called Mr. Reza Ali. His visionary
                                and entrepreneurial skills were the impetus for him to begin his foray in business
                                in Bangladesh. Thus started Bitopi’s journey through the creation of Bitopi Advertising
                                Limited, the oldest advertising agency in Bangladesh.
                            

                                While the advertising business grew and flourished, Reza saw an opportunity in business
                                expansion into a completely new venture. Ready made garment business was only just
                                developing in Bangladesh and in 1984, Reza entered the world of apparel manufacturing.
                                Now the Group is engaged in Apparel Manufacturing, Advertising, Event Management,
                                Fisheries & Agro sectors, with a total workforce of approximately 14,000 people.
                            

                                The Apparel Manufacturing began with Misami Garments Ltd, and has gradually expanded
                                into factories in the Comilla EPZ, in Adamjee, in Manikganj, and of course the original
                                building still standing in Shewrapara, Mirpur.

                                The chairman, Mr. Ali has always upheld a vision for his company – to be the best
                                bar none, and it has done so by investing in human resources, to train people and
                                bring about the competitive edge to its partners and customers. Bitopi is a family
                                owned company, headed at the top by a board comprising of individuals from competent

Worker Welfare Initiatives


Sustainabilities





Fair Price Shop: Our main goal is to provide
                        authentic and standard products on ex-factory price to all the workers so that all
                        the workers can get the product within reach. At the same time help worker benefit
                        through decreases in monthly costs on grocery items.
                    

Inclusive programme for person with disability:
                        Bitopi has always taken initiatives through undertaking charity work for the underprivileged
                        sections of the society. After collaborating with ILO on such inclusive program
                        we believe if we train them properly and recruits them as per their skills we will
                        be able to change the mindset of the society and they can perform as mainstream
                        worker in any kind of organization.
                        We have created job opportunities for the disabled people by accommodating supporting
                        equipment and training thus the initiatives can generate a great impact on economical
                        growth of our country.
                    

Women’s Economic Empowerment:There is
                        an overwhelming evidence that achieving gender sensitization for women has immediate
                        impacts that benefit them directly and larger ripple effects that are good for society
                        more broadly. Through affiliation with ILO and UNICEF and organizing awareness program
                        we wish to unleash the potential of women which is one of the most powerful and
                        enduring ways to help families and communities prosper.
                        From raising their voice to make knowledgeable about their rights regarding basic
                        facilities at work, work environment and proper evolution of work, health consciousness
                        and so on.
                        We make sure they get the support from us through skill training and various kinds
                        of health programme initiatives.

                                                    Incineration Boiler
                                                


                                                        To minimize the volume and disposal costs of the wastes generated at the different
                                                        units, TAL installed a 2 ton incineration boiler, which uses factory wastes - fabric
                                                        waste, thread cones, and carton boxes/paper as combustion fuel.




                                                    Biogas Plant
                                                


                                                        Biogas is the product of the natural biological breakdown of organic & carbon-rich
                                                        waste when the supply of oxygen is restricted. Our technology extracts the value
                                                        contained in non-recyclable waste by producing ‘biogas’, a methane-rich natural
                                                        gas.
                                                        It is renewable Source of Energy where wastage food has been used as a raw material.
                                                        Instead of disposing off the food waste every day, the factory uses it as feedstock
                                                        for its biogas plant for cooking.

                                                    Skylight
                                                


                                                        Prismatic skylights have been installed to reduce consumption of electricity. The
                                                        prismatic skylights diffuses the sun’s lights and make the interior not only bright,
                                                        but healthier for the occupants by improving the working environment of factories.




                                                    Solar panel
                                                


                                                        In order to manage electricity consumption, solar panels have been fitted on the
                                                        roof of the factories. 125 kw solar panels have installed and it helps to meet 5%
                                                        of the total electricity requirement of the factory.













                                            HVLS Fans
                                        



                                                    Unlike the usual fans used in offices, factories and houses, special fans have been
                                                    installed in the sewing floor of the factory. The factory has a total of 10 such
                                                    fans. The US-based technology helps to keep the inside temperature of the factory
                                                    at least 7-degree Celsius lower than the outside temperature, resulting in a healthy
                                                    and comfortable working atmosphere.













                                                Waste Water Treatment
                                            


                                                    ETP
                                                


                                                        Has been installed in 2 facilities of Bitopi Group to purify water and remove any
                                                        toxic and non toxic materials or chemicals from it. The Electro catalytic oxidation
                                                        technology is Innovative & a First in Bangladesh. The reactor synthesizes Nano catalysts
                                                        that continuously enter the wastewater and accelerate treatment processes. ETP is
                                                        essential to purify the waste water generated at the factory. The purified water
                                                        is again recycyled for washroom flush and plantation, with zero hazardous materials.




                                                    Condensate Recovery System
                                                


                                                        The condensate recovery system helps to conserve the steam and recover and reuse
                                                        it so that the energy consumption is reduced.




                                                    Thermos Oil Heater
                                                


                                                        Unlike conventional boilers, which use water/steam as heat transfer fluid, thermal
                                                        oil heaters can operate at atmospheric pressure and achieve temperatures up to 300°C.
                                                        Thermal oil heaters are thus relatively cheaper and convenient. Plus, they minimize
                                                        the risk of corrosion, lime deposits, and scale formation.
                                                        Two of the facilities replaced 12 steam dryers in the wet processing section with
                                                        12 thermal oil heaters and 9 Washing M/c Steam heating to Thermal oil Heating, thus
                                                        leading to less energy consumption.

                                                Water recycling is wastewater collected from Rain Water harvest plant and through
                                                ETP, as well as the wet wash process. This water is used in sustainable landscaping
                                                irrigation, industrial water needs, and toilet purpose.
