Company Overview


Icagen is an integrated early discovery partner, offering clients specialized technologies and deep scientific expertise to solve myriad challenges and optimize efficiency moving from target to lead. The process begins with druggable targets, and Icagen scientists bring exceptional experience in kinases, GPCR's, ion channels and transporters. Icagen works with clients to determine drug feasibility using state-of-the-art computational chemistry methods. Once a target is selected, Icagen can combine virtual screening, ultra-high throughput screening (uHTS), biology and medicinal chemistry to generate viable leads in a much shorter time than has traditionally been possible.

Pfizer To Acquire Icagen | Business Wire
























































Pfizer To Acquire Icagen






July 20, 2011 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK, N.Y., and RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Icagen, Inc. (Nasdaq: ICGN) today announced 
      that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. Pfizer, which 
      currently owns approximately 11% of Icagen’s fully diluted shares, will 
      acquire the remaining 8.3 million shares at a price of $6.00 per share. 
      The aggregate transaction value, including the value of the shares 
      currently owned by Pfizer, is approximately $56 million.
    


      In 2007, Pfizer and Icagen entered into a worldwide collaboration for 
      the discovery, development and commercialization of compounds that 
      modify three specific sodium ion channels as new potential treatments 
      for pain and related disorders. These sodium ion channels are important 
      in the generation of electrical signals in nerve fibers that mediate the 
      initiation, transmission and sensation of pain. By selectively targeting 
      these sodium channels, the companies are seeking to develop effective 
      treatments for serious pain disorders with fewer side effects.
    

      “We’re excited that Icagen, a global leader in pain research, will join 
      Pfizer, further strengthening our innovative core,” said Ruth McKernan, 
      senior vice president, Pfizer’s Pain & Sensory Disorders and 
      Regenerative Medicine unit, known as Neusentis. “Icagen’s capabilities 
      and core ion channel technology will help to further expand Pfizer’s 
      position in the pain relief disease area and our ability to develop 
      potential first-in-industry drugs for the treatment of pain and related 
      disorders.”
    

      "We are delighted to announce today Pfizer’s agreement to acquire 
      Icagen. During the nearly four years since the initiation of our 
      collaboration, each side has developed a mutual appreciation of the 
      expertise and capabilities of the other. By joining forces in a more 
      integrated manner, we believe that our joint efforts towards the 
      identification and development of novel pharmaceuticals targeting 
      specific ion channels will be significantly enhanced," noted P. Kay 
      Wagoner, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Icagen. "Importantly, I would 
      like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the dedicated efforts of 
      our employees, who have been responsible for the progress we have made. 
      We very much look forward to continuing our efforts as a part of the 
      Pfizer research organization."
    

      Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement, Pfizer will promptly 
      commence a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of 
      Icagen common stock for $6.00 per share in cash. The agreement also 
      provides for the parties to effect, subject to customary conditions, a 
      merger to be completed following the completion of the tender offer 
      which would result in all shares not tendered in the tender offer being 
      converted into the right to receive $6.00 per share in cash. The 
      completion of the tender offer is conditioned on Pfizer acquiring 
      sufficient shares to own a majority of the shares of Icagen on a 
      fully-diluted basis and other customary conditions.
    

      The companies are targeting closing before the end of the year.
    

      J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as financial advisor to Icagen.

      "could," "would," "might," "possible," "will," "should," "expect," 
      "intend," "plan," "anticipate," or "continue," the negative of these 
      words, other terms of similar meaning or the use of future dates. 
      Forward-looking statements in this release include without limitation 
      statements regarding the expected timing of the completion of the 
      acquisition of Icagen by Pfizer, and the potential benefits of the 
      acquisition, including the expected impact of the acquisition on

      the pain relief disease area. Investors and security holders are 
      cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking 
      statements. Actual results could differ materially from those currently 
      anticipated due to a number of risks and uncertainties.


Risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition of Icagen by

      control; transaction costs; actual or contingent liabilities; Pfizer's 
      ability to realize the expected benefits from its acquisition of Icagen; 
      and other uncertainties related to the business of Icagen and Pfizer. In

      risks inherent in the drug development process, and there can be no 
      assurance that the development of these compounds will be commercially 
      successful.


Forward-looking statements in this release should be evaluated 
      together with other risks and uncertainties discussed in Pfizer's and 
      Icagen's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
      "SEC"), including the "Risk Factors" sections of Pfizer's and Icagen's 
      most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports 
      on Form 10-Q, as well as the tender offer documents to be filed by 
      Eclipse Acquisition Corp., a subsidiary of Pfizer, and the 
      Solicitation/Recommendation Statement to be filed by Icagen. Neither

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
