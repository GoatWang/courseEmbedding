      and Senior Vice President of Fiesta. Mr. Meisenheimer has been interim 
      CEO of Fiesta since September 2016, and Chief Operating Officer and Vice 
      President of Pollo Tropical since 2013. Mr. Meisenheimer previously 
      served as Chief Brand Officer of Pollo Tropical in 2012. Prior to 
      joining Pollo Tropical, Mr. Meisenheimer was Chief Operating Officer 
      at Souper Salad, Inc. from 2010 to 2012 and Chief Brand Officer at 
      Souper Salad, Inc. from 2008 to 2010. Before that, Mr. Meisenheimer was 
      Vice President, Brand Management at Pizza Inn from 2005 to 2008.
    

      Board Chair Stacey Rauch said, “We are very pleased to welcome Rich 
      Stockinger as Fiesta’s new CEO and President. Rich is a respected, 
      results-driven industry veteran who understands the value of our Pollo 
      Tropical and Taco Cabana brands and has the skills and experience 
      necessary to be a strong and effective leader in advancing our strategic 
      initiatives at this critical juncture. Danny Meisenheimer’s material 
      contributions over the past five years at Pollo Tropical and as recent 
      Interim CEO and President make him the obvious choice to become COO of 
      Fiesta and partner with Rich to lead operations across both brands. I 
      would also like to welcome to our Board Paul Twohig, who brings 
      extensive restaurant leadership and operating experience, and thank Jack 
      Smith for his long-standing service as Chairman and continued leadership 
      as a non-executive Director.”
    

      Richard Stockinger said, “The opportunity at Fiesta is extraordinary. 
      The competitive positioning and potential upside of both Pollo Tropical 
      and Taco Cabana makes me optimistic about the future of the Company. I 
      look forward to working closely with the Board, the rest of management 
      and all of our dedicated team members to establish a comprehensive 
      operating and growth plan that we can deliver as a cohesive unit.”
    

Strategic Update


      For the past four months, a Committee of the Board of Fiesta carefully 
      evaluated a range of strategic alternatives potentially available to the 
      Company, including a possible sale of the Company. The Company retained 
      financial and legal advisors to assist it in evaluating a sale of the 
      Company and to conduct a confidential sale process. Following the review 
      of information provided by the Company, no potential counterparty 
      presented a final proposal to acquire Fiesta. Given recent soft Company 
      performance and a weak industry outlook, the Board concluded that the 
      Company should suspend the sale evaluation process, complete the hiring 
      of a permanent CEO and new director to bolster Company leadership and 
      continue to pursue a business plan focused on value creation as a 
      standalone company.
    

      The Board also affirmed its previously stated position that it will not 
      pursue the spin-off of the Taco Cabana brand at this time. In addition, 
      Fiesta will not pursue a divestiture of Taco Cabana given the 
      opportunities the Board believes remain with the brand and the 
      significant tax inefficiencies currently inherent in a sale transaction.
    

      For the time being, as previously disclosed, the Company intends to 
      maintain growth initiatives and restaurant development focused on 
      lower-risk and higher return Florida markets for Pollo Tropical and 
      Texas markets for Taco Cabana. In 2017, the Company expects to open 12 
      new Company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants in Florida and 10 new Taco 
      Cabana restaurants in Texas. Also during 2017, the Company plans to 
      remodel approximately 20 Pollo Tropical restaurants in its most 
      profitable region, south Florida. In addition, Fiesta’s current year 
      priorities at both Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana include improving 
      field operations through retraining and recertification of restaurant 
      managers and team members, optimizing and evolving its menus through new 
      product innovation, impactful marketing and expanding off-premise sales 
      through online ordering, catering, and third-party delivery services.
    

      Ms. Rauch concluded, “Fiesta operates two powerful brands with 
      tremendous appeal. Significant opportunities remain for growth in Pollo 
      Tropical and Taco Cabana’s existing markets, and while our expansion 
      into Texas for Pollo Tropical has been challenging, we continue to 
      believe in the long term attractiveness of the business model and its 
      potential beyond its traditional markets. In addition, we believe our 
      2017 priorities will enhance the overall brand experience, increase 
      guest frequency and open additional channels of sales growth. With an 
      energized team in place, we are eager to continue to deliver to our 
      loyal guests the quality and value they have long appreciated at Pollo 
      Tropical and Taco Cabana and to introduce new guests to our unique and 
      craveable product offerings.”

Great tasting Caribbean-inspired food you feel better about eating






Mexican-inspired food, made fresh by hand.







Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc
Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc., owns, operates and franchises the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurant brands. The brands specialize in the operation of fast-casual, ethnic restaurants that offer distinct and unique flavors with broad appeal at a compelling value. The brands feature made-from-scratch cooking, fresh salsa bars, drive-through service, online ordering, and catering.








What began in Miami as a simple recipe for citrus-marinated grilled chicken has evolved into a world of tropical flavors, and is quickly transforming into a lifestyle of happy, healthy, laid-back fun. Pollo Tropical continues to prove that life’s better under the palm. Welcome to Pollo Tropical where passion is married to freshness to create a one-of-a-kind experience.

Founded in San Antonio, Texas in 1978, Taco Cabana specializes in Mexican-inspired food made fresh by hand – tacos, quesadillas, flautas, enchiladas, rice, beans, and a selection of made-from-scratch salsas offered on our complimentary salsa bar. Flour tortillas are pressed and grilled from fresh dough balls in view of the guests while fajitas are grilled over an open flame. Taco Cabana offers a selection of beer and tequila margaritas, patio dining, and a convenient drive-thru.
