	Explanation of Responses:








	(


	1) 





	KAFU Holdings, L.P., KAFU Holdings (QP), L.P., and KAFU Holdings II, L.P. (collectively "KAFU") along with Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, L.P. ("KACALP") hold Class B shares representing limited partner interests in Plains GP Holdings L.P. (the "Issuer"), an equivalent number of units representing limited liability company interests of the Issuer's general partner ("GP Units"), and an equivalent number of Class A units representing limited partner interests in Plains AAP, L.P. ("AAP"). The limited partnership agreement of AAP was amended and restated to provide that each limited partner of AAP, including KAFU and KACALP, will have the right at any time (without expiration) to immediately exchange (the "Exchange Right") its Class A units in AAP together with a like number of Class B shares and the GP Units, for a like number of Class A shares of the Issuer.







	(


	2) 





	On March 26, 2015, KAFU Holdings, L.P. transferred a total of 87,435,415 Class B shares, Class A units in AAP, and GP Units to KAFU Holdings (QP), L.P., a sister entity under common control.







	(


	3) 





	KACALP is the manager of the general partner of KAFU and may be deemed to beneficially own the Class B shares, Class A units in AAP, and the GP Units held by KAFU. The filing of this statement shall not be construed as an admission that either KAFU or KACALP are, for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, as amended, the beneficial owner of any security.







	(


	4) 





	The reported transaction is an in-kind distribution to redeeming limited partners of KAFU. Such redemptions were made in-kind with Class A shares.
