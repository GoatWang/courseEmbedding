Past performance does not guarantee future results. The performance data quoted represents past performance and current returns may be lower or higher. The investment return and net asset value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns greater than one year are annualized. Investment performance reflects contractual fee waivers. Without these fee waivers, the performance would have been lower.
 
Performance information for the Nebraska Tax-Free Fund from December 31, 2007 to January 3, 2016 reflects the performance of the Fund’s predecessor common trust fund. The common trust fund had investment objectives, policies and restrictions, restrictions and guidelines that were equivalent in all material respects to those of the Fund, and was managed by First National Bank of Omaha. The Fund commenced business on January 4, 2016. The performance of the Predecessor Fund was calculated net of the Predecessor Fund’s fees and expenses. The performance of the Predecessor Fund has not been restated to reflect the fees, estimated expenses and fee waivers and/or expense limitations of the Fund. If the performance of the Predecessor Fund had been restated to reflect the applicable fees and expenses of the Fund, the performance may have been higher or lower than the performance displayed above. The predecessor common trust fund was not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and therefore was not subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by that Act. If the common trust fund had been registered, its performance might have been adversely affected.
 
The performance information shown above for the Institutional Plus Class reflects the Fund’s Institutional Class returns for the periods prior to the inception date of the Institutional Plus Class as noted above. Unlike Institutional Plus Class shares, Institutional Class shares impose a non-12b-1 shareholder services fee of 0.25%, which is reflected in the return information. Accordingly, had the Institutional Plus Class been in operation prior to the inception date noted above, the performance for that period would have been different as a result of lower annual operating expenses.
 
The current expense ratio reflects the annualized expense ratio as of the quarter end.
 
The gross and net expense ratios are as reflected in the current prospectus.
 
Equity securities (stocks) are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments, including investments in high grade fixed income securities. The net asset value per share will fluctuate as the value of the securities in the portfolio changes. Common stocks, and funds investing in common stocks, generally provide greater return potential when compared with other types of investments.
 
Small capitalization funds typically carry additional risks since smaller companies generally have a higher risk of failure.
 
Stock funds are more volatile and carry more risk and return potential than other forms of investments. Bonds offer a relatively stable level of income, although bond prices will fluctuate, providing the potential for principal gain or loss. Cash equivalents offer low risk and low return potential.
 
Bond Funds will tend to experience smaller fluctuations in value than stock funds. However, investors in any bond fund should anticipate fluctuations in price, especially for longer-term issues and in environments of rising interest rates.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Income Fund – Tributary Funds





















 
















Income Fund
(FOINX, FOIPX)




Philosophy

            We believe in order to achieve long-term success in the fixed-income market, we must avoid permanent loss of capital and consistently exploit the inefficiencies and opportunities that the bond market inevitable exhibits.



Strategy

            The Fund intends to invest primarily all, but must invest at least 80%, of its total assets in fixed income securities and expects to maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of four years or more under normal market conditions.



Objective

            The objective of the Tributary Income Fund is to maximize total returns in a manner consistent with the generation of current income and the preservation of capital.  We believe our focus on avoiding a permanent loss of capital leads to a greater consistency of performance and superior returns over a long-term horizon.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. The performance data quoted represents past performance and current returns may be lower or higher. The investment return and net asset value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns greater than one year are annualized. Investment performance reflects contractual fee waivers. Without these fee waivers, the performance would have been lower.
 
The performance information shown above for the Institutional Plus Class reflects the Fund’s Institutional Class returns for the periods prior to the inception date of the Institutional Plus Class as noted above. Unlike Institutional Plus Class shares, Institutional Class shares impose a non-12b-1 shareholder services fee of 0.25%, which is reflected in the return information. Accordingly, had the Institutional Plus Class been in operation prior to the inception date noted above, the performance for that period would have been different as a result of lower annual operating expenses.
 
The current expense ratio reflects the annualized expense ratio as of the quarter end.
 
The gross and net expense ratios are as reflected in the current prospectus.
 
Bond Funds will tend to experience smaller fluctuations in value than stock funds. However, investors in any bond fund should anticipate fluctuations in price, especially for longer-term issues and in environments of rising interest rates.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Nebraska Tax-Free Fund – Tributary Funds





















 
















Nebraska Tax-Free Fund
(FONPX)




Philosophy

            We believe in order to achieve long-term success in the fixed-income market, we must avoid permanent loss of capital and consistently exploit the inefficiencies and opportunities that the bond market inevitable exhibits.



Strategy

            Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests primarily, but not less than 80% of its assets in municipal securities that generate income exempt from Nebraska state income tax and federal income tax, including the alternative minimum tax.



Objective

            The objective of the Tributary Nebraska Tax-Free Fund is to seek as high a level of current income exempt from both federal and Nebraska income tax as is consistent with the preservation of capital.  We believe our focus on avoiding a permanent loss of capital leads to a greater consistency of performance and superior returns over a long-term horizon.

Performance information for the Nebraska Tax-Free Fund from December 31, 2007 to January 3, 2016 reflects the performance of the Fund’s predecessor common trust fund. The common trust fund had investment objectives, policies and restrictions, restrictions and guidelines that were equivalent in all material respects to those of the Fund, and was managed by First National Bank of Omaha. The Fund commenced business on January 4, 2016. The performance of the Predecessor Fund was calculated net of the Predecessor Fund’s fees and expenses. The performance of the Predecessor Fund has not been restated to reflect the fees, estimated expenses and fee waivers and/or expense limitations of the Fund. If the performance of the Predecessor Fund had been restated to reflect the applicable fees and expenses of the Fund, the performance may have been higher or lower than the performance displayed above. The predecessor common trust fund was not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and therefore was not subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by that Act. If the common trust fund had been registered, its performance might have been adversely affected.
 
Past performance does not guarantee future results. The performance data quoted represents past performance and current returns may be lower or higher. The investment return and net asset value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns greater than one year are annualized. Investment performance reflects contractual fee waivers. Without these fee waivers, the performance would have been lower.
 
The current expense ratio reflects the annualized expense ratio as of the quarter end.
 
The gross and net expense ratios are as reflected in the current prospectus.
 
Bond Funds will tend to experience smaller fluctuations in value than stock funds. However, investors in any bond fund should anticipate fluctuations in price, especially for longer-term issues and in environments of rising interest rates.
