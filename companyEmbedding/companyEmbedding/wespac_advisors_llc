What are analysts saying about Illinois Tool Works stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Illinois Tool Works stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "In the last three months, Illinois Tool's shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Machinery-General Industrial market. Over the long run, the company’s organic and inorganic growth tactics, its long-term Enterprise Strategy and sound capital allocation schemes will prove beneficial. For 2017, it increased its earnings guidance to $6.20-$6.40 per share. Organic revenue growth is expected to be 2-4%, an improvement over the prior forecast of 1.5-3.5%. Total revenue is anticipated to come within $13.9-$14.1 billion range. Over the last 60 days, earnings estimates on the stock increased for 2018. " (7/12/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "ITW hosted an Investor Day in New York this morning and provided initial guidance for 2017. Organic revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% and 100bps of EBIT expansion from Enterprise Initiatives are projected to yield EPS in the range of $6.00-$6.20 (Consensus at $6.14 on revenue growth of 3%). With a strong history of execution and low drama, we continue to view ITW as a core holding. Bottom Line: 2017 another year of stable growth. ITW’s preliminary forecast for organic revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% for 2017 compares to current consensus forecast of ~3% but assumes no improvement in end market trends. The guidance includes roughly 50bps of headwind from Product Line Simplification (PLS) actions, lower than the 100bps headwind since 2014-16. ITW’s targeted EPS range of $6.00-$6.20 compares to current consensus of $6.14. Of note: ITW’s 2017 EBIT margin target is 23.5%, 100bps above the 2016 target, and indeed management noted the target could be conservative." (12/5/2016)

Our Firm 

WESPAC was founded to deliver administration and recordkeeping services to retirement plans. Through WESPAC Plan Services, LLC, we still continue to offer the personalized service and creative level of plan design to small and mid-sized employers that the larger providers cannot.  As a third party retirement plan administrator, we perform the duties necessary for a plan to comply with legal, regulatory, and the plan’s own requirements as set forth in the plan document.
Wespac Advisors, LLC has been an SEC registered investment advisor* since 1995. Wespac Advisors provides portfolio management services to our retirement plan clients, high net worth clients, and other registered investment advisors. Learn More.
WESPAC Benefit and Insurance Services provides an array of benefit plan solutions designed to save employers both time and money.  A good health and welfare benefit plan is one of the largest recurring (and increasing) costs for businesses today, and our strategic relationships with the most prominent insurance providers can help save our clients money at each step of the way.
