                                Report abuseTranscript of Auschwitz by Charles N WhittakerAuschwitz by Charles N WhittakerWhat is the poem about?The poem describes prisoners traveling toAuschwitz concentration camp in WWII. Auschwitz was a formidable camp and was famous for being very horrific for prisoners. It had a train track linking it so Germany so they could transport prisoners easily and this train is what the poem describes as it was very terrifying for them.Whittaker is an activist for Holocaust Memorial Day Trust (HMDT) a UK charity. Whittaker wrote this poem for Holocaust Memorial Day its purpose being to raise awareness of the horrors that were performed at the the concentration camps to make sure that something like this never happens again.Prisoners arriving at the concentration campConclusionThe PoemMood The theme of the poem about the concentration camp Auschwitz creates a sinister mood. The poet highlights the fear and desperation of the prisoners by such phrases as "And the terror in the eyes of all the young ones to go". The ideas of death and murder are clearly conveyed such as the phrase " And the people on board who will ne...ver go.Back." (The isolation of the word back on its own line emphasises that this journey is final just as death is final).The History behind The PoemAuschwitzPoetic Devices used by the PoetThe Poet uses enjambment to keep the flow of the poem. The rhythm of it makes you feel like you are on a train.Rhyming couplets also give the poem a constant rhythm like the chugging motion of a train and the continued transport of the prisoners.By creating this idea of traveling on a train, the poet makes us empathise with the prisoners who were on their way to the camp. It evokes feelings of anxiety and suspense.Personification is used in the line "And the blue ink stabs a little harder in the skin", which makes you imagine and almost feel the needle as it tattoos the concentration camp numbers on the prisoners arms.AuschwitzThe semiquaver chugging of the train on the trackAnd the people on board who will never go backAnd the terror in the eyes of all the young ones to goWith no one knowing as the train comes to slowThose men at the station as the ramps drop downWhere humanity lost is the only crippled soundHope gone for those who stand behind the hard sharp wireAnd the smoke in the towers rises just a little higherAnd the blue ink stabs a little harder in the skinAbove the veins of despair where murder let it inAnd the terror in the eyes of all those about to leaveAnother train on the track no last minute reprieveAnd the slow, cro...chet chugging of the train on the track;And the people on board. Who will ne...ver go.Back.By Charles N WhittakerThe Poets IntentionsIn conclusion we believe that the poet definitely achieved his original idea with this poem of highlighting the horrors of Auschwitz therefor raising awareness, We think that he did this by creating a very vivid dark picture of the prisoners and the camp/train. Also as mentioned by using poetic techniques such as enjambment he gave the poem a good rhythm and flow to reflect the mood of the text.Full transcriptMore presentations by

Go Back

 












The poem was written by HMD activity organiser Charles N Whittaker, about the transportation of people to the Auschwitz camp.  The poem has a rhythm which evokes the trains used to forcibly transport people to extermination camps during the Holocaust.  Double BAFTA winning actor Olivia Colman has lent her support to Holocaust Memorial Day 2014 by recording Auschwitz.  You can listen to the recording here.AuschwitzThe semiquaver chugging of the train on the trackAnd the people on board who will never go backAnd the terror in the eyes of all the young ones to goWith no one knowing as the train comes to slowThose men at the station as the ramps drop downWhere humanity lost is the only crippled soundHope gone for those who stand behind the hard sharp wireAnd the smoke in the towers rises just a little higherAnd the blue ink stabs a little harder in the skinAbove the veins of despair where murder let it inAnd the terror in the eyes of all those about to leaveAnother train on the track no last minute reprieveAnd the slow, cro...chet chugging of the train on the track;And the people on board. Who will ne...ver go.Back.By Charles N WhittakerDownload Auschwitz
