SQUARETWO FINANCIAL’S L. HEATH SAMPSON NAMED A COLORADOBIZ MAGAZINE “TOP 25 MOST INFLUENTIAL YOUNG PROFESSIONAL”
DENVER, Colo. – Nov. 8, 2010 – SquareTwo Financial, a leader in the $40 billion asset recovery and management industry, today announced chief financial officer L. Heath Sampson as one of ColoradoBIZ Magazine’s “Top 25 Most Influential Young Professionals.”
Sampson, who joined SquareTwo Financial in 2009, recently led the company’s successful development and completion of a $475 million financing package. He came to Colorado in 1991 from Calgary, Alberta, after earning a Division 1 hockey scholarship from the University of Denver, and began his financial career in 1996 after graduating from DU, which in 2006 recognized him as the “Young Alumnus of the Year“ for the accounting profession. Sampson is also a coach for children in hockey and soccer and has been involved in the United Way and the Western Union Foundation.
“I want to congratulate Heath on this well-deserved recognition as a ‘Top 25 Most Influential Professional,’” said Paul A. Larkins, CEO and president of SquareTwo Financial. “From the moment Heath’s feet hit the ground here at SquareTwo, he’s been a tremendous asset for both the financial expertise he brings to our organization and his role in community. He successfully led SquareTwo Financial’s public bond offering earlier this year during a challenging economic environment, which helped position us for growth and created new jobs in Colorado. I’m pleased that Health is being recognized for achievements we are privileged to see every day.”
To select the Top 25, judges viewed more than 150 nominations of professionals younger than 40 and chose individuals based on their professional achievements and involvement in the community. The magazine announced the Top 25 in its October issue and recognized the Top 25 individuals at a celebratory dinner.
“It is an honor be named one of the Top 25 Young Professionals in Colorado. It is a very exciting time in my career,” Sampson said. “I enjoy coming to work every day because I’m surrounded by smart, hard-working, innovative colleagues. Their passion and drive pushes me to be my best. Without them, I would not have been able to achieve what I have at this point in my career.”
