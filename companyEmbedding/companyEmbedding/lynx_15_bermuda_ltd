The Company
Lynx Asset Management was founded in 1999 and is today one of the world's leading firms in model-based asset management. From our office in the heart of Stockholm’s financial district we manage the Lynx programme, a fully-diversified managed futures programme that aims to deliver high risk-adjusted returns that are uncorrelated to traditional asset classes.

Lynx’s business idea involves the use of quantitative methods to predict price movements on the financial markets. This quantitative and systematic approach is typical of all aspects of our business. The number of employees has been increasing steadily, and we now have a team of around seventy people. Most of our employees are engaged in the development of new quantitative strategies and models. We are continually improving the investment process and reward curiosity and innovative thinking among our personnel.The company is responsible for investments in the Swedish hedge funds Lynx and Lynx Dynamic, as well as the offshore based fund Lynx (Bermuda) Ltd. We also manage Lynx 1.5 (Bermuda) Ltd., which offers a higher level of risk. Finally, the company also manages separate managed accounts with a similar investment mandate according to the Lynx programme.The company is jointly owned by its three founding partners, the other portfolio managers, a few key employees and Brummer & Partners, Scandinavia’s leading hedge fund company.Please visit www.brummer.se for information about Brummer & Partners’ other funds.

Lynx Asset Management (Lynx
1.5 (Bermuda) Ltd.)

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        LYNX is a global managed futures fund. The objective of the Fund's investments is to achieve a high risk-adjusted return in combination with a low correlation with the stock and bond markets. The target is to generate an average yearly return of 15-20 percent subject to a risk level defined as a yearly standard deviation of 18 percent. 
The Fund invests in futures contracts, on the global futures markets. The Fund's holdings can be divided into four types of assets: stock indices, fixed-income, currencies and commodities. 
Lynx's main approach is systematic trend-following applied to a broadly diversified portfolio of markets. Further diversification is achieved by using models over multiple time frames, with holding periods varying from a couple of hours up to a year or more. The programme also trades contrarian models in an attempt to achieve better risk-adjusted returns and enhance performance in a non-trending market environment. Intermarket models use other inputs than the price in the market itself. There is also a short-term module where trades are held from a few hours to a few days. In aggregate, these models are used to make quantitative analyses of price fluctuations on the market. They are designed to identify market situations in which there is an enhanced probability that future price changes will be in a certain direction.
By using different models in conjunction with each other on each market, the programme can generate a more stable risk-adjusted return than a pure trend-following strategy.
Risk management is an integrated feature in the investment process and Lynx focuses on diversification and portfolio construction. Around 65 futures markets are traded across four sectors; equity indices, fixed income, currencies and commodities. Position sizes are determined based on correlations with other markets.
The models operate independently and the portfolio is built "bottom-up" based on the signals from each model. Minimization of each investment's loss is integrated in the design of the models e.g. by using automated stop-loss mechanisms. As a result the risk utilization in the programme changes dynamically over time, limiting drawdowns.
Value-at-Risk is used to limit position concentration and risk levels. Three parallel VaR-models are monitored in real-time by the trading desk and there are limits on instrument, asset class and total portfolio level.
