Meet Our Founder


 


Curtis W. Mewbourne, a native of Shreveport, Louisiana, obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Oklahoma, where he has been honored as a Distinguished Graduate. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Army and working as a petroleum engineer in industry, he founded Mewbourne Oil Company in 1965. Mewbourne Oil is one of the most successful privately owned oil and gas producers in America. Mr. Mewbourne continues to operate the company privately.
In recognition of his longtime support, the University of Oklahoma named the Mewbourne School of Petroleum and Geological Engineering in his honor in May of 2000, and granted him the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 2002. On November 2, 2007, the Mewbourne College of Earth & Energy was named in his honor and he was given the Trailblazer Award for his professional achievements and lifetime commitment to the energy center.

April 20, 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-14,
“Accounting for Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas:
Amendments to Paragraph 932-10-S99-1” to make the definitions
in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 932-10-S99-1 consistent
with those in the SEC Final Rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas
Accounting”. The Partnership adopted the new standards
effective December 31, 2009. This update had no effect on the
Partnership’s financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

    Accounting
for Oil and Gas Producing Activities




The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil
and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and
non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties
subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas
properties. At June 30, 2010, approximately $6.2 million of
capitalized costs were excluded from amortization. Proceeds from
the sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the
full cost pool. Gains and losses on the sale or other disposition
of properties are not recognized unless such adjustments would
significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and
the proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a
quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of
the present value of future net cash flows of proved reserves and
the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties.

    Asset
Retirement Obligations




The
Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future
plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on
historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is
discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to
the liability could occur due to changes in well ownership
interests, well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful
lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration
requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in
connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of
the well.

A
reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for well
plugging and abandonment costs for the six months ended
June 30, 2010 and the period from February 26, 2009 (date
of inception) through December 31, 2009 is as

In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership.
Mewbourne Oil Company (“MOC”) is operator of oil and
gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc.
is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions
are with MD and MOC.

In
the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that
will be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will receive their portion of these costs
based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and
customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision,
pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which
will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in
accordance with the program and partnership agreements.

In
consideration for services rendered by MD in managing the business
of the Partnership, the Partnership during each of the initial
three years of the Partnership will pay to MD a management fee in
the amount equal to .75% of the subscriptions by the investor
partners to the Partnership. The Partnership will include the
management fee as part of the full cost pool pursuant to 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X.

In
general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall
not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership’s
gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production
during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating
costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000
plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general
partners.

CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    Description
of Business




Mewbourne
Energy Partners 06-A, L.P. (the “Registrant” or the
“Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership, is
engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in
Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, and was organized on
November 16, 2005. The offering of limited and general
partnership interests began July 11, 2006 as a part of an
offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners 06-07
Drilling Program, (the “Program”), and concluded
September 1, 2006, with total investor contributions of
$50,000,000 originally being sold to 1,576 subscribers of which
$43,174,000 were sold to 1,342 subscribers as general partner
interests and $6,826,000 were sold to 234 subscribers as limited
partner interests. During, 2008, all general partner equity
interests were converted to limited partner equity interests. In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the
Partnership.

 




2.



    Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies




Reference is
hereby made to the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for 2010, which contains a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Partnership in the preparation of its
financial statements. These policies are also followed in preparing
the quarterly report included herein.

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial
statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods
presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the
full year.

 




3.



    
Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities




The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil
and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and
non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties
subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas
properties. At June 30, 2011 and 2010, all capitalized costs
were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains
and losses on the sale or other disposition of properties are not
recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the
relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas
reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test
that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of
future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or
fair value of unproved properties. There was no cost ceiling
write-down for the three or six months ended June 30, 2011 or
2010.

Asset Retirement Obligations




The
Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future
plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on
historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is
discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to
the liability could occur due to changes in well ownership
interests or well plugging and abandonment costs, or if federal or
state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The
Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the
discounted liability over the remaining life of the
well.

A
reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for well
plugging and abandonment costs for the six months ended
June 30, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010 is as
follows:

Related Party Transactions




In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership.
Mewbourne Oil Company (“MOC”) is operator of oil and
gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc.
is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions
are with MD and MOC.

In
the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that
will be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will receive their portion of these costs
based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and
customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision,
pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which
will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in
accordance with the program and partnership agreements.

In
general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall
not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership’s
gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production
during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating
costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000
plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general
partners.

The
Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through the
Program. The Partnership and MD are the parties to the Program, and
the costs and revenues are allocated between them as

Pursuant to the
Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and offering costs
and lease acquisition costs which should approximate 20% of total
capital costs. To the extent that organization and offering costs
and lease acquisition costs are less than 20% of total capital
costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its
share of the Program’s total capital costs reaches
approximately 20%. The Partnership’s financial statements
reflect its respective proportionate interest in the
Program.




   Item 2.
  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Mewbourne
Energy Partners 06-A, L.P. (the “Partnership”) was
formed November 16, 2005. The offering of limited and general
partnership interests began July 11, 2006 and concluded
September 1, 2006, with total investor contributions of
$50,000,000. During 2008, all general partner equity interests were
converted to limited partner equity interests.

Future capital
requirements and operations will be conducted with available funds
generated from oil and gas activities. No bank borrowing is
anticipated. The Partnership had net working capital of $840,129 at
June 30, 2011.

During the six
months ended June 30, 2011, the Partnership made cash
distributions to the investor partners in the amount of $1,704,799
as compared to $2,656,378 for the six months ended June 30,
2010. The Partnership expects that cash distributions will continue
during 2011 as additional oil and gas revenues are sufficient to
produce cash flows from operations.

The sale of
crude oil and natural gas produced by the Partnership will be
affected by a number of factors that are beyond the
Partnership’s control. These factors include the price of
crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for
these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation,
extensive federal and state regulations governing the production
and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive
conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the
future effect of these factors on the Partnership.
