This document contains and incorporates by reference certain forward-looking statements regarding our financial condition, results of operations and business. These statements are not historical facts and include expressions about management's confidence and strategies and management's expectations about new and existing programs and products, acquisitions, relationships, opportunities, taxation, technology, market conditions and economic expectations.
You may identify these statements by looking for:

forward-looking terminology, like "should," "expect," "believe," "view," "opportunity," "allow," "continues," "reflects," "typically," "usually," or "anticipate;" 
expressions of confidence like "strong" or "on-going;" or 
similar statements or variations of those terms.

These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results the forward-looking statements contemplate because of, among others, the following possibilities:

failure to obtain shareholder or regulatory approval for the merger of USAB with Valley or to satisfy other conditions to the merger on the proposed terms and within the proposed timeframe; 
delays in closing the merger; 
the inability to realize expected cost savings and synergies from the merger in amounts or in the timeframe anticipated; 
changes in the estimate of non-recurring charges; 
the diversion of management's time on issues relating to the merger; 
costs or difficulties relating to USAB integration matters might be greater than expected; 
material adverse changes in Valley's or USAB's operations or earnings; 
an increase or decrease in the stock price of Valley during the 30 day pricing period prior to the closing of the merger which could cause an adjustment to the exchange ratio or give either Valley or USAB the right to terminate the merger agreement under certain conditions; 
the inability to retain USAB's customers and employees; 
weakness or a decline in the economy, mainly in New Jersey, New York, Florida and Alabama, as well as an unexpected decline in commercial real estate values within our market areas; 
less than expected cost savings and revenue enhancement from Valley's cost reduction plans, including its earnings enhancement program called "LIFT"; 
damage verdicts or settlements or restrictions related to existing or potential litigations arising from claims of breach of fiduciary responsibility, negligence, fraud, contractual claims, environmental laws, patent or trade mark infringement, employment related claims, and other matters; 
the loss of or decrease in lower-cost funding sources within our deposit base may adversely impact our net interest income and net income; 
cyber attacks, computer viruses or other malware that may breach the security of our websites or other systems to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage our systems; 
results of examinations by the OCC, the FRB, the CFPB and other regulatory authorities, including the possibility that any such regulatory authority may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for credit losses, write-down assets, require us to reimburse customers, change the way we do business, or limit or eliminate certain other banking activities; 
changes in accounting policies or accounting standards, including the new authoritative accounting guidance (known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model) which may increase the required level of our allowance for credit losses after adoption on January 1, 2020; 
higher or lower than expected income tax expense or tax rates, including increases or decreases resulting from changes in tax laws, regulations and case law; 
our inability to pay dividends at current levels, or at all, because of inadequate future earnings, regulatory restrictions or limitations, and changes in capital requirements; 
higher than expected loan losses within one or more segments of our loan portfolio; 
unanticipated loan delinquencies, loss of collateral, decreased service revenues, and other potential negative effects on our business caused by severe weather or other external events; 
unexpected significant declines in the loan portfolio due to the lack of economic expansion, increased competition, large prepayments, changes in regulatory lending guidance or other factors; and 
the failure of other financial institutions with whom we have trading, clearing, counterparty and other financial relationships.

A detailed discussion of factors that could affect our results is included in our SEC filings, including the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in our expectations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.

This document contains and incorporates by reference certain forward-looking statements regarding our financial condition, results of operations and business. These statements are not historical facts and include expressions about management's confidence and strategies and management's expectations about new and existing programs and products, acquisitions, relationships, opportunities, taxation, technology, market conditions and economic expectations.
You may identify these statements by looking for:

forward-looking terminology, like "should," "expect," "believe," "view," "opportunity," "allow," "continues," "reflects," "typically," "usually," or "anticipate;" 
expressions of confidence like "strong" or "on-going;" or 
similar statements or variations of those terms.

These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results the forward-looking statements contemplate because of, among others, the following possibilities:

failure to obtain shareholder or regulatory approval for the merger of USAB with Valley or to satisfy other conditions to the merger on the proposed terms and within the proposed timeframe; 
delays in closing the merger; 
the inability to realize expected cost savings and synergies from the merger in amounts or in the timeframe anticipated; 
changes in the estimate of non-recurring charges; 
the diversion of management's time on issues relating to the merger; 
costs or difficulties relating to USAB integration matters might be greater than expected; 
material adverse changes in Valley's or USAB's operations or earnings; 
an increase or decrease in the stock price of Valley during the 30 day pricing period prior to the closing of the merger which could cause an adjustment to the exchange ratio or give either Valley or USAB the right to terminate the merger agreement under certain conditions; 
the inability to retain USAB's customers and employees; 
weakness or a decline in the economy, mainly in New Jersey, New York, Florida and Alabama, as well as an unexpected decline in commercial real estate values within our market areas; 
less than expected cost savings and revenue enhancement from Valley's cost reduction plans, including its earnings enhancement program called "LIFT"; 
damage verdicts or settlements or restrictions related to existing or potential litigations arising from claims of breach of fiduciary responsibility, negligence, fraud, contractual claims, environmental laws, patent or trade mark infringement, employment related claims, and other matters; 
the loss of or decrease in lower-cost funding sources within our deposit base may adversely impact our net interest income and net income; 
cyber attacks, computer viruses or other malware that may breach the security of our websites or other systems to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage our systems; 
results of examinations by the OCC, the FRB, the CFPB and other regulatory authorities, including the possibility that any such regulatory authority may, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for credit losses, write-down assets, require us to reimburse customers, change the way we do business, or limit or eliminate certain other banking activities; 
changes in accounting policies or accounting standards, including the new authoritative accounting guidance (known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model) which may increase the required level of our allowance for credit losses after adoption on January 1, 2020; 
higher or lower than expected income tax expense or tax rates, including increases or decreases resulting from changes in tax laws, regulations and case law; 
our inability to pay dividends at current levels, or at all, because of inadequate future earnings, regulatory restrictions or limitations, and changes in capital requirements; 
higher than expected loan losses within one or more segments of our loan portfolio; 
unanticipated loan delinquencies, loss of collateral, decreased service revenues, and other potential negative effects on our business caused by severe weather or other external events; 
unexpected significant declines in the loan portfolio due to the lack of economic expansion, increased competition, large prepayments, changes in regulatory lending guidance or other factors; and 
the failure of other financial institutions with whom we have trading, clearing, counterparty and other financial relationships.

A detailed discussion of factors that could affect our results is included in our SEC filings, including the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in our expectations. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.

 VALLEY NATIONAL BANCORP (NYSE:VLY) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
On July26, 2017, Valley National Bancorp (“Valley”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with USAmeriBancorp, Inc. (“USAB”), providing for the merger of USAB with and into Valley, with Valley as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). Immediately following the Merger, USAmeriBank, a Florida state-chartered commercial bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of USAB, will merge with and into Valley National Bank, a national banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary of Valley, with Valley National Bank surviving the merger. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, each share of common stock of USAB will be converted into 6.100 shares of Valley common stock, subject to adjustment as described below and subject to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. Subject to the termination rights set forth below, in the event Valley’s volume-weighted average share price during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending 5 trading days prior to closing (the “Average Closing Price”) is less than $11.50, then Valley will increase the 6.100 exchange ratio (or, in lieu of such increase, make a cash payment to USAB shareholders equal to the difference between (i)$69.00 and (ii)the product of the Average Closing Price multiplied by 6.100) so that USAB shareholders receive $69.00 in Valley common stock for each USAB share they hold. Subject to the termination rights set forth below, in the event the Average Closing Price is greater than $13.00, then Valley will decrease the 6.100 exchange ratio so that USAB shareholders receive $79.30 in Valley common stock for each USAB share they hold. In the event the Average Closing Price is less than $11.00, either Valley or USAB may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement. In the event the Average Closing Price is greater than $13.50, then USAB may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement. Each outstanding share of Valley common stock will remain outstanding and be unaffected by the Merger. 
In addition to the foregoing, at the effective time of the Merger, Valley will either (i)convert each outstanding share of Series C preferred stock of USAB (the “USAB Preferred Stock”) into shares of Valley preferred stock having identical rights and preferences as the USAB Preferred Stock or (ii)redeem the USAB Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with its terms. 
With respect to outstanding USAB stock options to acquire USAB common stock, such USAB stock options will vest only to the extent set forth in the USAB stock plans and option grant agreements. In addition, such USAB stock options will be converted, at the effective time of the Merger, into Valley stock options to acquire Valley common stock where the number of shares of Valley common stock underlying such Valley stock options will be equal to the number of shares of USAB common stock underlying such USAB stock options multiplied by the exchange ratio and the exercise price per share of Valley common stock subject to such Valley stock options will be equal to the exercise price per share of USAB common stock subject to such USAB stock option divided by the exchange ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Valley elects to make a cash payment to USAB shareholders as described above, the exchange ratio will be based on the total merger consideration so that the USAB stock options are converted on economically equivalent terms. 
With respect to outstanding USAB warrants to acquire USAB common stock, such USAB warrants will be converted at the effective time of the Merger into Valley warrants to acquire Valley common stock where the number of shares of Valley common stock underlying such Valley warrants will be equal to the number of shares of USAB common stock underlying such USAB warrants multiplied by the exchange ratio and the exercise price per share of Valley common stock subject to such Valley warrants will be equal to the exercise price per share of USAB common stock subject to such USAB warrants divided by the exchange ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Valley elects to make a cash payment to USAB shareholders as described above, the exchange ratio will be based on the total merger consideration so that the USAB warrants are converted on economically equivalent terms. 
With respect to USAB restricted stock units representing the right to receive a share of USAB common stock, such USAB restricted stock units will vest only to the extent set forth in the USAB stock plans and award agreements and be converted into the right to receive, at the effective time of the Merger, the same consideration as holders of USAB common stock are receiving in the Merger. 
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties, and covenants of Valley and USAB, including, among others, a covenant that requires (i)each of Valley and USAB to conduct its business in the ordinary course and consistent with past banking practice during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and consummation of the Merger and (ii)USAB to not engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period (without the prior written consent of Valley). USAB has also agreed, subject to certain exceptions generally related to the Board’s evaluation and exercise of its fiduciary duties, to not (i)solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or (ii)enter into discussions or negotiations or provide confidential information in connection with any proposals for alternative business combination transactions. Valley has also agreed to elect Jennifer Steans, Chairperson of USAB, to serve as a Valley director, subject to her meeting Valley’s qualifications for service on Valley’s board of directors, as of the effective time of the Merger. In addition, if Valley pays a cash dividend on Valley common stock, USAB will have the right, subject to the receipt of any required regulatory approvals, to pay its shareholders an equivalent cash dividend. 
The Merger Agreement provides certain termination rights for both Valley and USAB, and further provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, USAB will be obligated to pay Valley a termination fee of $30 million, plus Valley’s reasonable out of pocket expenses up to $2 million, and if the Merger Agreement is terminated under other certain circumstances, Valley will be obligated to pay USAB up to $2 million of USAB’s reasonable out of pocket expenses. 
Completion of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including (i)receipt of the requisite approval (a)of the Merger by shareholders of USAB and (b)of the issuance of Valley common stock in the Merger by shareholders of Valley, (ii)receipt of regulatory approvals, (iii)the absence of any law or order prohibiting the closing, (iv)no more than 10% of CNL shareholders exercising their dissenters’ rights under Florida law and (v)effectiveness of the registration statement to be filed by Valley with respect to the capital stock to be issued in the Merger. In addition, each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to certain other conditions, including the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party and compliance of the other party with its covenants in all material respects. 
The Merger Agreement also contains representations and warranties that the parties have made to each other as of specific dates. Except for its status as a contractual document that establishes and governs the legal relations among the parties with respect to the Merger described therein, the Merger Agreement is not intended to be a source of factual, business or operational information about the parties. The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specific dates, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a shareholder might view as material, may have been used for purposes of allocating risk between the respective parties rather than establishing matters as facts, may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the Merger Agreement that were made to the other party in connection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement and generally were solely for the benefit of the parties to that agreement. 
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein. 
Additional Information and Where to Find It 
This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed Merger, Valley intends to file a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that will include a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”). Valley may file other documents with the Commission regarding the proposed transaction.

Grenz, Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp, at 1455 Valley Road, Wayne, New Jersey 07470, telephone (973)305-3380. 
Participants in the Solicitation

However, Valley, USAmeriBancorp, their respective directors and executive officers and other persons may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from USAmeriBancorp’s shareholders in respect of approval of the Merger and the solicitation of proxies from Valley’s shareholders in respect of approval of the issuance of shares of common stock of Valley in connection with the Merger. Information regarding the directors and executive officers of Valley may be found in its definitive proxy statement relating to its 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which was filed with the Commission on March17, 2017 and in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2016, each of which can be obtained free of charge from Valley’s website.

In recent trading, shares of Valley National Bancorp have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $11.58, changing hands for $11.88/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level.

VLY September 15th Options Begin Trading
Investors in Valley National Bancorp saw new options become available today, for the September 15th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 235 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.
