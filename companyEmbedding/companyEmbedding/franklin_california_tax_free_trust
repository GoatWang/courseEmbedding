                                                        OPINION AND ORDER re 95 Motion to Dismiss, 97 Motion to Dismiss, 78 Motion for summary judgment. The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Commonwealth defendants' motion to dismiss, Docket No. 95. The motion is DENIED as to plaint iffs' preemption and Contract Clause claims; GRANTED as to plaintiffs' stay of federal court proceedings claim; DENIED as to plaintiffs' Takings Clause claim based on their contractual right to seek the appointment of a receiver; and G RANTED as to plaintiffs' Takings Clause claim based on their lien on PREPA revenues. The stay of federal court proceedings claim and Takings Clause claim based on plaintiffs' lien on PREPA revenues are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. PREPA 39;s motion to dismiss, Docket No. 97, is GRANTED as to all claims to the extent that they are asserted against PREPA. PREPA is DISMISSED from this case because plaintiffs lack standing against it. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, Docke t No. 78, is GRANTED as to plaintiffs' preemption claim and DENIED as to plaintiffs' stay of federal court proceedings claim.The Recovery Act is preempted by the federal Bankruptcy Code and is therefore void pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Signed by Judge Francisco A. Besosa on 02/06/2015. (RRS)

For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund, Franklin Large Cap Equity Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin Ultra-Short California Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.
