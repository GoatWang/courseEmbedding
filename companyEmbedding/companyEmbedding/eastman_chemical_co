History[edit]
Early years[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


An effect of World War I was a scarcity in raw materials such as photographic paper, optical glass, gelatin and many chemicals, including methanol, acetic acid and acetone. After the war ended, Eastman Kodak founder George Eastman began working to have an independent supply of chemicals for his photographic processes. His search for suitable quantities of methanol and acetone led him to the southern United States.
In 1920, Tennessee Eastman was founded with two major platforms – organic chemicals and acetyls. Products such as calcium acetate, sodium acetate, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride became the basis for the company’s platforms.
During World War II, RDX, a powerful explosive, was manufactured for the U.S. government at Holston Ordnance Works at Tennessee Eastman sites. At the peak of production near the end of the war, the ordnance plant was producing a million and a half pounds of explosives each day. Tennessee Eastman was responsible for managing the Y-12 National Security Complex at Oak Ridge, Tennessee which produced enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, from 1943 to May 1947.
Since the 1980s[edit]
In 1983, Eastman opened the first commercial coal gasification facility in the United States at its Kingsport plant site to produce chemicals from syngas rather than petroleum. Eastman also owns and operates a gasification facility at its Longview, Texas, site to produce syngas from natural gas. Eastman Gasification Services Company, formed in 2003, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Eastman that supplies gasification facility design and start-up. The "Chemicals from Coal Facility" at the Kingsport plant was recognized as a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in 1995.[4]
In 1994 Eastman Chemical Company spun off from Eastman Kodak and became an independent corporation. In early 2005 Eastman broke ground on the first world-scale manufacturing facility using IntegRex, a technology that reduces the number of intermediate process steps in producing PET resin. This technology is now owned by DAK Americas.
In July 2012, Eastman Chemical Corporation completed its acquisition of Solutia Inc., a manufacturer of performance materials and specialty chemicals, for $4.8 billion.[5]

Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility[edit]
As of 2006 Eastman was ranked twenty-seventh among U.S. corporate producers of air pollution according to a 2010 study conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute. Eastman facilities in four U.S. states released 7.02 million pounds of toxic chemicals into the air in that year. The Environmental Protection Agency has also linked Eastman to several Superfund toxic waste sites, according to the Center for Public Integrity.
Eastman has been a member of Responsible Care®, a global voluntary initiative developed autonomously by the chemical industry to improve health, safety, and environmental performance, for more than 25 years. In 2013, Eastman was named Responsible Care Company of the Year in the large company category by the American Chemistry Council (ACC).[7] Eastman was awarded the 2009 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award presented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The award recognizes technologies that incorporate the principles of green chemistry into chemical design, manufacture, and use.
Through 2015, Eastman improved energy intensity by approximately 8% compared to a 2008 baseline. The company established a goal to improve energy intensity 20% by 2020. In 2014 and early 2016, Eastman converted two boilers at its Kingsport, Tennessee, site from coal to natural gas combustion.[8] Three additional boilers will be converted by 2018 for a total of five. The Kingsport boiler conversion project is the most significant air pollution control project in the history of Eastman and will diversify the Kingsport facility’s energy mix from 90% coal to 50% coal and 50% natural gas. Eastman also converted a coal-fired boiler at its Indian Orchard facility in Springfield, Massachusetts, to natural gas in 2015.[8]
As of 2016, Eastman has been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year five consecutive years. Eastman has also been recognized three consecutive years by Glassdoor as an Employees’ Choice Best Place to Work and by Ethisphere Institute as a World’s Most Ethical Company.

Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility[edit]
As of 2006 Eastman was ranked twenty-seventh among U.S. corporate producers of air pollution according to a 2010 study conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst Political Economy Research Institute. Eastman facilities in four U.S. states released 7.02 million pounds of toxic chemicals into the air in that year. The Environmental Protection Agency has also linked Eastman to several Superfund toxic waste sites, according to the Center for Public Integrity.
Eastman has been a member of Responsible Care®, a global voluntary initiative developed autonomously by the chemical industry to improve health, safety, and environmental performance, for more than 25 years. In 2013, Eastman was named Responsible Care Company of the Year in the large company category by the American Chemistry Council (ACC).[7] Eastman was awarded the 2009 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award presented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The award recognizes technologies that incorporate the principles of green chemistry into chemical design, manufacture, and use.
Through 2015, Eastman improved energy intensity by approximately 8% compared to a 2008 baseline. The company established a goal to improve energy intensity 20% by 2020. In 2014 and early 2016, Eastman converted two boilers at its Kingsport, Tennessee, site from coal to natural gas combustion.[8] Three additional boilers will be converted by 2018 for a total of five. The Kingsport boiler conversion project is the most significant air pollution control project in the history of Eastman and will diversify the Kingsport facility’s energy mix from 90% coal to 50% coal and 50% natural gas. Eastman also converted a coal-fired boiler at its Indian Orchard facility in Springfield, Massachusetts, to natural gas in 2015.[8]
As of 2016, Eastman has been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year five consecutive years. Eastman has also been recognized three consecutive years by Glassdoor as an Employees’ Choice Best Place to Work and by Ethisphere Institute as a World’s Most Ethical Company.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


An effect of World War I was a scarcity in raw materials such as photographic paper, optical glass, gelatin and many chemicals, including methanol, acetic acid and acetone. After the war ended, Eastman Kodak founder George Eastman began working to have an independent supply of chemicals for his photographic processes. His search for suitable quantities of methanol and acetone led him to the southern United States.
In 1920, Tennessee Eastman was founded with two major platforms – organic chemicals and acetyls. Products such as calcium acetate, sodium acetate, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride became the basis for the company’s platforms.
During World War II, RDX, a powerful explosive, was manufactured for the U.S. government at Holston Ordnance Works at Tennessee Eastman sites. At the peak of production near the end of the war, the ordnance plant was producing a million and a half pounds of explosives each day. Tennessee Eastman was responsible for managing the Y-12 National Security Complex at Oak Ridge, Tennessee which produced enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, from 1943 to May 1947.
Since the 1980s[edit]
In 1983, Eastman opened the first commercial coal gasification facility in the United States at its Kingsport plant site to produce chemicals from syngas rather than petroleum. Eastman also owns and operates a gasification facility at its Longview, Texas, site to produce syngas from natural gas. Eastman Gasification Services Company, formed in 2003, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Eastman that supplies gasification facility design and start-up. The "Chemicals from Coal Facility" at the Kingsport plant was recognized as a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in 1995.[4]
In 1994 Eastman Chemical Company spun off from Eastman Kodak and became an independent corporation. In early 2005 Eastman broke ground on the first world-scale manufacturing facility using IntegRex, a technology that reduces the number of intermediate process steps in producing PET resin. This technology is now owned by DAK Americas.
In July 2012, Eastman Chemical Corporation completed its acquisition of Solutia Inc., a manufacturer of performance materials and specialty chemicals, for $4.8 billion.[5]

Eastman Chemical (EMN) to Hike Prices of Specific Products


July 19, 2017, 10:01:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

  Eastman Chemical Company EMN  announced plans to increase the price of specific products The company will raise the prices of isopthalic acid by 6 cents per pound in North and Latin America while prices of acetic anhydride will increase by 3 cents  in these regions. The company noted that it is raising the prices of isopthalic acid owing to higher market demand and operating costs, especially in raw materials. Eastman Chemical has modestly outperformed the Zacks categorized Chemicals-Diversified  industry over the last three months. The company's shares have gained around 6.8% over this period compared with roughly 6.4% gain recorded by the industry.    The company expects to drive growth on the back of innovation and high margin products amid uncertain global business environment. It believes that disciplined capital allocation and aggressive cost management policies should contribute to earnings growth and offset challenges in the Fibers segment. In 2017, the company expects adjusted earnings per share to grow 8-12%. Earnings for its Advanced Materials unit in the first quarter increased owing to strong sales volume growth, better product mix of premium products and fixed cost leverage that more than offset higher raw material energy costs and modestly lower selling prices. Also, the company witnessed an increase in operating margin in the quarter amid an environment of raw materials inflation and unfavorable currency. The Additives & Functional Products segment witnessed modest increase in operating earnings in the quarter as improved sales volume was mostly offset by higher raw material and energy costs, lower selling prices and unfavorable currency. The company intends to continue increasing prices beyond the second quarter in response to a spike in raw materials prices. Eastman Chemical remains focused on cost cutting and productivity actions amid a challenging operating environment. Further, the company should gain from its strategic acquisitions and capacity expansion actions. Eastman Chemical also remains committed to reduce debt and boost shareholders return by leveraging healthy free cash flows.  Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus           Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus    |      Eastman Chemical Company Quote   Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider  Eastman Chemical currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked companies in the chemical space are Arkema S.A. ARKAY  , Koninklijke DSM N.V. RDSMY  and Hitachi Chemical Company, Ltd. HCHMY  . All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here  .  Arkema has expected long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. Koninklijke has expected long-term earnings growth rate of 7.7%.

Eastman Chemical (EMN) Q2 Earnings: What’s in the Cards?

Tuesday, July 25, 2017 Zacks Equity Research News, stream 


Eastman Chemical Company EMN is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after closing the bell on Jul 27.
Eastman Chemical witnessed higher profits on a reported basis in first-quarter 2017, aided by its aggressive cost management actions, disciplined capital allocation and growth of high-margin products. The chemical maker recorded earnings of $278 million or $1.89 per share in the first quarter, up from the year-ago figure of $251 million or $1.69.
Barring one-time items, earnings were $1.83 per share for the quarter, up from $1.71 in the year ago-quarter. Earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 per share.
Revenues rose around 2.9% year over year to $2,303 million in the first quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,241 million.
Eastman Chemical topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 4.21%.
Eastman Chemical stock has gained 5.4% in the last three months, outperforming the 3.1% gain of the industry it belongs to.
 
Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.
Factors to Consider
Eastman Chemical, in its last earnings call, announced that it expects growth to be driven by innovation and high margin products, amid uncertain global business environment. The company believes that disciplined capital allocation and aggressive cost management policies should contribute to earnings growth and offset challenges faced by the company in Fibers segment. In 2017, the company expects adjusted earnings per share to grow 8–12%.
Earnings for the company’s Advanced Materials unit in the first quarter increased owing to strong sales volume growth, better product mix of premium products and fixed cost leverage that more than offset higher raw material energy costs and modestly lower selling prices. Also, the company witnessed an increase in operating margin in the quarter amid an environment of raw materials inflation and unfavorable currency.
The Additives & Functional Products segment witnessed modest increase in operating earnings in the quarter as improved sales volume was mostly offset by higher raw material and energy costs, lower selling prices and unfavorable currency.
Eastman Chemical remains focused on cost cutting and productivity actions amid a challenging operating environment. Further, the company should gain from its strategic acquisitions (especially Taminco Corporation) and capacity expansion actions. The company also remains committed to reduce debt and boost shareholders return by leveraging healthy free cash flows.

Eastman Chemical Company

Kingsport, Tennessee

Partner of the Year - Sustained Excellence


Energy Management



Eastman is a global specialty chemical company that manufactures a broad range of products found in everyday items. Eastman is receiving ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year—Sustained Excellence recognition for improving efficiency while transforming its portfolio toward specialty chemicals and for developing energy efficiency breakthroughs in chemical production processes. Key 2016 accomplishments include:

Reducing energy intensity by more than three percent over 2015. Energy intensity has improved more than 10 percent since 2008. Using the baseline energy intensity compared to current production at present energy prices, Eastman would have spent $36.3 million more in 2016 on energy if the energy intensity had not changed since 2008.
Formulating successful energy management strategies to control inefficiencies as the business shifted to the manufacture of specialty chemicals, which tend to be more energy intensive.
Initiating 120 energy savings projects with a focus on optimizing steam and electrical systems by engaging consultants and internal utility, capital, and manufacturing staff. Simple payback of these projects is greater than industry average indicating the maturity of the Eastman energy program.
Participating in the ENERGY STAR Challenge for Industry by achieving a 10-percent reduction in energy intensity at two Eastman sites and entering two buildings in EPA’s National Building Competition: BOOTCAMP.
Supporting ENERGY STAR industrial partners and the community by engaging and informing about energy efficiency and opportunities for savings.
