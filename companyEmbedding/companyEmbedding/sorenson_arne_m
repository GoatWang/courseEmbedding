(LINDA SPILLERS/ BLOOMBERG NEWS)  Marriott International plans to relocate its headquarters from its sprawling Bethesda campus in coming years, chief executive Arne M. Sorenson said last week, prompting what could be a high-stakes battle for the prominent corporate nameplate among local jurisdictions. A little more than 2,000 people work at Marriott’s corporate headquarters, located in over 900,000 square square feet on Fernwood Road in Bethesda. Sorenson said last week that the global icon would be relocating within the region and that he had begun informally discussing the company’s options with local leaders. Marriott’s lease expires in 2022. “It’s time to start thinking about it,” Sorenson said. “We’ve got almost a million square feet in Bethesda. Obviously you can’t decide one month you’re going to move one million square feet worth of office and move the next month. This is something that’s going to take some years to get worked out.” Sorenson said he considered the Washington area the hospitality capital of the world, with competitors Hilton Worldwide, Choice Hotels, DiamondRock Hospitality and other firms in close proximity. He praised the area’s “supremely well-educated workforce” but said in order to attract the best talent he needed a location that would appeal to young workers. “I think it’s essential we be accessible to Metro and that limits the options. I think as with many other things our younger folks are more inclined to be Metro-accessible and more urban. That doesn’t necessarily mean we will move to downtown Washington, but we will move someplace.” Marriott is currently housed in a suburban office park, the center of which was built in 1978, and the likes of which some companies have been vacating in recent years during a rush back into urban areas. Though it is located near Interstate 270 and the Capital Beltway, the complex is about three miles from the nearest Metro stop, the Grosvenor station. Sorenson, 56, the first non-member of the Marriott family to run the company, would not commit to remaining in Maryland. He said had already had informal discussions with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and D.C. officials about his interest in relocating. He gave a mixed review of the Maryland business climate. “Maryland has not been great for business, but it hasn’t been aggressively trying to run them out,” Sorenson said. “I think it’s more just in the last few years [the state] probably hasn’t cared about it. I don’t think it’s been against it.”    Arne M. Sorenson, chief executive of Marriott International. (Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg)  Keeping the company may constitute a first major test for new Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who made waves on the campaign trail about the fact that his state is no longer home to many Fortune 500 companies. There are currently only four, as previously Maryland entries including Black & Decker, Coventry Health Care and Constellation New Energy have been acquired or merged with companies headquartered elsewhere. Another major employer, McCormick & Co., maker of Old Bay Seasoning, is also mulling a relocation.  “We’ve had the largest mass exodus of taxpayers fleeing our state, of any state in our region, and one of the worst in the nation,” Hogan said during his first State of the State address, in February. State officials are working to make sure the company remains, said Karen Glenn Hood, a spokeswoman for the state department of business and economic development. “Obviously Marriott’s an iconic company. It’s a world-class company and we have a great relationship with them. We are engaged with them on a regular basis. And it’s a company that we clearly want to continue to call Maryland home so we are going to work with them and make sure that happens,” she said. Sally Sternbach, acting director of the Montgomery County Department of Economic Development, said the county was taking a “very thoughtful and very thorough look at what will help them to grow and succeed.” “Accessibility is important and amenities are important. And yes we will try to work with them on both and put them where they feel they will get a good return for that,” she said. Spokespeople for McAuliffe and D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) declined comment. Marriott’s headquarters have been in Montgomery County since 1955, but if its proposed relocation prompts something of a bidding war among local jurisdictions it will not be the first time. . In 1999 the company flirted with a move to Fairfax County before Maryland put up an incentive package worth as much as $58 million, depending on an array of circumstances. Marriott has been a darling of the stock market during the past two years, and increased its fourth quarter earnings by 30 percent last year. It posted 2014 profits of $753 million, or $2.54 per share, on revenue of $13.8 billion. Sorenson expects it will have 1 million rooms open or in development by later this year. In all, the state said Marriott employs 9,970 people in Maryland.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Arne Sorenson has the following 1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Anesthesiology
    Anesthesiologists are physicians who are trained to administer anesthetics, which are medicines used to block nerve sensation. Anesthesia can be either local to one specific part of a body, like a tooth, or regional to block feeling to a larger portion of the body, such as during an epidural for child birth. It can also be more general to block sensation to the entire body, resulting in unconsciousness.


    Anesthesiologists assist in surgery by determining how much anesthesia is necessary and by monitoring the patient's level of responsiveness and vital signs throughout the procedure. The anesthesia specialist will also bring the patient out of anesthesia and then continue to monitor his or her vital signs post-operation.


    Besides assisting in surgeries, anesthesiologists may also treat patients suffering from chronic pain.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
