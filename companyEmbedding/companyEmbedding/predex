Indications and Usage for Precedex







Intensive Care Unit Sedation
PrecedexTM is indicated for sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in an intensive care setting. Precedex should be administered by continuous infusion not to exceed 24 hours.
Precedex has been continuously infused in mechanically ventilated patients prior to extubation, during extubation, and post-extubation. It is not necessary to discontinue Precedex prior to extubation.

Procedural Sedation
Precedex is indicated for sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures.

Precedex Dosage and Administration

Dosing Guidelines

•
Precedex dosing should be individualized and titrated to desired clinical response.
•
Precedex is not indicated for infusions lasting longer than 24 hours.
•
Precedex should be administered using a controlled infusion device.


Dosage Information

Table 1: Dosage Information





INDICATION


DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 




Initiation of Intensive Care Unit Sedation


For adult patients: a loading infusion of one mcg/kg over 10 minutes.
For adult patients being converted from alternate sedative therapy: a loading dose may not be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
For patients over 65 years of age: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
For adult patients with impaired hepatic-function: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Maintenance of Intensive Care Unit Sedation


For adult patients: a maintenance infusion of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hour. The rate of the maintenance infusion should be adjusted to achieve the desired level of sedation.
For patients over 65 years of age: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
For adult patients with impaired hepatic function: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]




Initiation of Procedural Sedation


For adult patients: a loading infusion of one mcg/kg over 10 minutes. For less invasive procedures such as ophthalmic surgery, a loading infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg given over 10 minutes may be suitable.
For awake fiberoptic intubation in adult patients: a loading infusion of one mcg/kg over 10 minutes.
For patients over 65 years of age: a loading infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg over 10 minutes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
For adult patients with impaired hepatic function: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Maintenance of Procedural Sedation


For adult patients: the maintenance infusion is generally initiated at 0.6 mcg/kg/hour and titrated to achieve desired clinical effect with doses ranging from 0.2 to 1 mcg/kg/hour. The rate of the maintenance infusion should be adjusted to achieve the targeted level of sedation.
For awake fiberoptic intubation in adult patients: a maintenance infusion of 0.7 mcg/kg/hour is recommended until the endotracheal tube is secured.
For patients over 65 years of age: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
For adult patients with impaired hepatic function: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





Dosage Adjustment
Due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, a reduction in dosage of Precedex or other concomitant anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics or opioids may be required when co-administered [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
Dosage reductions may need to be considered for adult patients with hepatic impairment, and geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Preparation of Solution
Strict aseptic technique must always be maintained during handling of Precedex.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
Precedex Injection, 200 mcg/2 mL (100 mcg/mL)
Precedex must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection to achieve required concentration (4 mcg/mL) prior to administration. Preparation of solutions is the same, whether for the loading dose or maintenance infusion.
To prepare the infusion, withdraw 2 mL of Precedex Injection, and add to 48 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection to a total of 50 mL. Shake gently to mix well.
Precedex in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 80 mcg/20 mL (4 mcg/mL), 200 mcg/50 mL (4 mcg/mL) and 400 mcg/100 mL (4 mcg/mL)
Precedex in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is supplied in glass containers containing a premixed, ready to use dexmedetomidine hydrochloride solution in 0.9% sodium chloride in water. No further dilution of these preparations are necessary.

Administration with Other Fluids
Precedex infusion should not be co-administered through the same intravenous catheter with blood or plasma because physical compatibility has not been established.
Precedex has been shown to be incompatible when administered with the following drugs: amphotericin B, diazepam.
Precedex has been shown to be compatible when administered with the following intravenous fluids:

•
0.9% sodium chloride in water
•
5% dextrose in water
•
20% mannitol
•
Lactated Ringer's solution
•
100 mg/mL magnesium sulfate solution
•
0.3% potassium chloride solution


Compatibility with Natural Rubber
Compatibility studies have demonstrated the potential for absorption of Precedex to some types of natural rubber. Although Precedex is dosed to effect, it is advisable to use administration components made with synthetic or coated natural rubber gaskets.


Dosage Forms and Strengths
Precedex Injection
Precedex Injection, 200 mcg/2 mL dexmedetomidine (100 mcg/mL) in a glass vial. To be used after dilution.

Warnings and Precautions

Drug Administration
Precedex should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting. Due to the known pharmacological effects of Precedex, patients should be continuously monitored while receiving Precedex.

Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest
Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with Precedex administration in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration.
Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with Precedex infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of Precedex, increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because Precedex has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of Precedex-induced bradycardia. However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required.
Caution should be exercised when administering Precedex to patients with advanced heart block and/or severe ventricular dysfunction. Because Precedex decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients.
In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with Precedex an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed. Nonetheless, caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with Precedex.

Transient Hypertension
Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of Precedex. Treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary, although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable.

Arousability
Some patients receiving Precedex have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms.

Withdrawal
Intensive Care Unit Sedation
With administration up to 7 days, regardless of dose, 12 (5%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 (3%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug. The most common events were nausea, vomiting, and agitation.
In adult subjects, tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of <5%. If tachycardia and/or hypertension occurs after discontinuation of Precedex supportive therapy is indicated.
Procedural Sedation
In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short term infusions of Precedex (<6 hours).

Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis
Use of dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Hepatic Impairment
Since Precedex clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].





Adverse Reactions

Clinical Studies Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
Use of Precedex has been associated with the following serious adverse reactions:

•
Hypotension, bradycardia and sinus arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
•
Transient hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions, occurring in greater than 2% of patients in both Intensive Care Unit and procedural sedation studies include hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth.
Intensive Care Unit Sedation
Adverse reaction information is derived from the continuous infusion trials of Precedex for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit setting in which 1007 adult patients received Precedex. The mean total dose was 7.4 mcg/kg (range: 0.8 to 84.1), mean dose per hour was 0.5 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.1 to 6.0) and the mean duration of infusion of 15.9 hours (range: 0.2 to 157.2). The population was between 17 to 88 years of age, 43% ≥65 years of age, 77% male and 93% Caucasian. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of >2% are provided in Table 2. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Procedural Sedation
Adverse reaction information is derived from the two trials for procedural sedation [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] in which 318 adult patients received Precedex. The mean total dose was 1.6 mcg/kg (range: 0.5 to 6.7), mean dose per hour was 1.3 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.3 to 6.1) and the mean duration of infusion of 1.5 hours (range: 0.1 to 6.2). The population was between 18 to 93 years of age, ASA I-IV, 30% ≥65 years of age, 52% male and 61% Caucasian.
Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of >2% are provided in Table 6. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Pre-specified criteria for the vital signs to be reported as adverse reactions are footnoted below the table. The decrease in respiratory rate and hypoxia was similar between Precedex and comparator groups in both studies.

Postmarketing Experience
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Precedex. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
Hypotension and bradycardia were the most common adverse reactions associated with the use of Precedex during post approval use of the drug.

Drug Interactions

Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids
Co-administration of Precedex with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between Precedex and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with Precedex, a reduction in dosage of Precedex or the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required.

Neuromuscular Blockers
In one study of 10 healthy adult volunteers, administration of Precedex for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of one ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Pregnancy
Pregnancy Category C
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Precedex use in pregnant women. In an in vitro human placenta study, placental transfer of dexmedetomidine occurred. In a study in the pregnant rat, placental transfer of dexmedetomidine was observed when radiolabeled dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously. Thus, fetal exposure should be expected in humans, and Precedex should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus.
Teratogenic effects were not observed in rats following subcutaneous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis (from gestation day 5 to 16) with doses up to 200 mcg/kg (representing a dose approximately equal to the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or in rabbits following intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis (from gestation day 6 to 18) with doses up to 96 mcg/kg (representing approximately half the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose based on plasma area under the time-curve comparison). However, fetal toxicity, as evidenced by increased post-implantation losses and reduced live pups, was observed in rats at a subcutaneous dose of 200 mcg/kg. The no-effect dose in rats was 20 mcg/kg (representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison). In another reproductive toxicity study when dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats at 8 and 32 mcg/kg (representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison) from gestation day 16 through weaning, lower offspring weights were observed. Additionally, when offspring of the 32 mcg/kg group were allowed to mate, elevated fetal and embryocidal toxicity and delayed motor development was observed in second generation offspring.

Labor and Delivery
The safety of Precedex during labor and delivery has not been studied.

Nursing Mothers
It is not known whether Precedex is excreted in human milk. Radio-labeled dexmedetomidine administered subcutaneously to lactating female rats was excreted in milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Precedex is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use
Safety and efficacy have not been established for Procedural or ICU Sedation in pediatric patients. One assessor-blinded trial in pediatric patients and two open label studies in neonates were conducted to assess efficacy for ICU sedation. These studies did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints and the safety data submitted were insufficient to fully characterize the safety profile of Precedex for this patient population. The use of Precedex for procedural sedation in pediatric patients has not been evaluated.

Geriatric Use
Intensive Care Unit Sedation
A total of 729 patients in the clinical studies were 65 years of age and over. A total of 200 patients were 75 years of age and over. In patients greater than 65 years of age, a higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was observed following administration of Precedex [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Therefore a dose reduction may be considered in patients over 65 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Procedural Sedation
A total of 131 patients in the clinical studies were 65 years of age and over. A total of 47 patients were 75 years of age and over. Hypotension occurred in a higher incidence in Precedex-treated patients 65 years or older (72%) and 75 years or older (74%) as compared to patients <65 years (47%). A reduced loading dose of 0.5 mcg/kg given over 10 minutes is recommended and a reduction in the maintenance infusion should be considered for patients greater than 65 years of age.

Hepatic Impairment
Since Precedex clearance decreases with increasing severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Drug Abuse and Dependence

Controlled Substance
Precedex (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) is not a controlled substance.

Dependence
The dependence potential of Precedex has not been studied in humans. However, since studies in rodents and primates have demonstrated that Precedex exhibits pharmacologic actions similar to those of clonidine, it is possible that Precedex may produce a clonidine-like withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Overdosage
The tolerability of Precedex was studied in one study in which healthy adult subjects were administered doses at and above the recommended dose of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr. The maximum blood concentration achieved in this study was approximately 13 times the upper boundary of the therapeutic range. The most notable effects observed in two subjects who achieved the highest doses were first degree atrioventricular block and second degree heart block. No hemodynamic compromise was noted with the atrioventricular block and the heart block resolved spontaneously within one minute.
Five adult patients received an overdose of Precedex in the intensive care unit sedation studies. Two of these patients had no symptoms reported; one patient received a 2 mcg/kg loading dose over 10 minutes (twice the recommended loading dose) and one patient received a maintenance infusion of 0.8 mcg/kg/hr. Two other patients who received a 2 mcg/kg loading dose over 10 minutes, experienced bradycardia and/or hypotension. One patient who received a loading bolus dose of undiluted Precedex (19.4 mcg/kg), had cardiac arrest from which he was successfully resuscitated.

Precedex - Clinical Pharmacology

Mechanism of Action
Precedex is a relatively selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist with sedative properties. Alpha2 selectivity is observed in animals following slow intravenous infusion of low and medium doses (10-300 mcg/kg). Both alpha1 and alpha2 activity is observed following slow intravenous infusion of high doses (≥1000 mcg/kg) or with rapid intravenous administration.

Pharmacodynamics
In a study in healthy volunteers (N = 10), respiratory rate and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits and there was no evidence of respiratory depression when Precedex was administered by intravenous infusion at doses within the recommended dose range (0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr).

Pharmacokinetics
Following intravenous administration, dexmedetomidine exhibits the following pharmacokinetic parameters: a rapid distribution phase with a distribution half-life (t1/2) of approximately 6 minutes; a terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of approximately 2 hours; and steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of approximately 118 liters. Clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L/h. The mean body weight associated with this clearance estimate was 72 kg.
Dexmedetomidine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the dosage range of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr when administered by intravenous infusion for up to 24 hours. Table 8 shows the main pharmacokinetic parameters when Precedex was infused (after appropriate loading doses) at maintenance infusion rates of 0.17 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 0.3 ng/mL) for 12 and 24 hours, 0.33 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 0.6 ng/mL) for 24 hours, and 0.70 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 1.25 ng/mL) for 24 hours.

The loading doses for each of the above indicated groups were 0.5, 0.5, 1 and 2.2 mcg/kg, respectively.
Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic parameters after Precedex maintenance doses of 0.2 to 1.4 mcg/kg/hr for >24 hours were similar to the PK parameters after Precedex maintenance dosing for < 24 hours in other studies. The values for clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V), and t1/2 were 39.4 L/hr, 152 L, and 2.67 hours, respectively.
Distribution
The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of dexmedetomidine was approximately 118 liters. Dexmedetomidine protein binding was assessed in the plasma of normal healthy male and female subjects. The average protein binding was 94% and was constant across the different plasma concentrations tested. Protein binding was similar in males and females. The fraction of Precedex that was bound to plasma proteins was significantly decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects.
The potential for protein binding displacement of dexmedetomidine by fentanyl, ketorolac, theophylline, digoxin and lidocaine was explored in vitro, and negligible changes in the plasma protein binding of Precedex were observed. The potential for protein binding displacement of phenytoin, warfarin, ibuprofen, propranolol, theophylline and digoxin by Precedex was explored in vitro and none of these compounds appeared to be significantly displaced by Precedex.
Metabolism
Dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexmedetomidine excreted in urine and feces. Biotransformation involves both direct glucuronidation as well as cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism. The major metabolic pathways of dexmedetomidine are: direct N-glucuronidation to inactive metabolites; aliphatic hydroxylation (mediated primarily by CYP2A6 with a minor role of CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) of dexmedetomidine to generate 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, the glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, and 3-carboxy-dexmedetomidine; and N-methylation of dexmedetomidine to generate 3-hydroxy N-methyl-dexmedetomidine, 3-carboxy N-methyl-dexmedetomidine, and dexmedetomidine-N-methyl O-glucuronide.
Elimination
The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of dexmedetomidine is approximately 2 hours and clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L/h. A mass balance study demonstrated that after nine days an average of 95% of the radioactivity, following intravenous administration of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine, was recovered in the urine and 4% in the feces. No unchanged dexmedetomidine was detected in the urine. Approximately 85% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted within 24 hours after the infusion. Fractionation of the radioactivity excreted in urine demonstrated that products of N-glucuronidation accounted for approximately 34% of the cumulative urinary excretion. In addition, aliphatic hydroxylation of parent drug to form 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, the glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, and 3-carboxylic acid-dexmedetomidine together represented approximately 14% of the dose in urine. N-methylation of dexmedetomidine to form 3-hydroxy N-methyl dexmedetomidine, 3-carboxy N-methyl dexmedetomidine, and N-methyl O-glucuronide dexmedetomidine accounted for approximately 18% of the dose in urine. The N-Methyl metabolite itself was a minor circulating component and was undetected in urine. Approximately 28% of the urinary metabolites have not been identified.
Gender
There was no observed difference in Precedex pharmacokinetics due to gender.
Geriatrics
The pharmacokinetic profile of Precedex was not altered by age. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of Precedex in young (18–40 years), middle age (41–65 years), and elderly (>65 years) subjects.
Hepatic Impairment
In subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C), clearance values for Precedex were lower than in healthy subjects. The mean clearance values for patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were 74%, 64% and 53% of those observed in the normal healthy subjects, respectively. Mean clearances for free drug were 59%, 51% and 32% of those observed in the normal healthy subjects, respectively.
Although Precedex is dosed to effect, it may be necessary to consider dose reduction in subjects with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
Renal Impairment
Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics (Cmax, Tmax, AUC, t1/2, CL, and Vss) were not significantly different in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance: <30 mL/min) compared to healthy subjects.
Drug Interactions
In vitro studies: In vitro studies in human liver microsomes demonstrated no evidence of cytochrome P450 mediated drug interactions that are likely to be of clinical relevance.

Nonclinical Toxicology

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
Animal carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with dexmedetomidine.
Dexmedetomidine was not mutagenic in vitro, in either the bacterial reverse mutation assay (E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium) or the mammalian cell forward mutation assay (mouse lymphoma). Dexmedetomidine was clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test with, but not without, rat S9 metabolic activation. In contrast, dexmedetomidine was not clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test with or without human S9 metabolic activation. Although dexmedetomidine was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test in NMRI mice, there was no evidence of clastogenicity in CD-1 mice.
Fertility in male or female rats was not affected after daily subcutaneous injections of dexmedetomidine at doses up to 54 mcg/kg (less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose on a mcg/m2 basis) administered from 10 weeks prior to mating in males, and 3 weeks prior to mating and during mating in females.

Animal Pharmacology and/or Toxicology
There were no differences in the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol response in dogs following a single dose of dexmedetomidine compared to saline control. However, after continuous subcutaneous infusions of dexmedetomidine at 3 mcg/kg/hr and 10 mcg/kg/hr for one week in dogs (exposures estimated to be within the clinical range), the ACTH-stimulated cortisol response was diminished by approximately 27% and 40%, respectively, compared to saline-treated control animals indicating a dose-dependent adrenal suppression.

Clinical Studies
The safety and efficacy of Precedex has been evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials in 1185 adult patients.

Intensive Care Unit Sedation
Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials included 754 adult patients being treated in a surgical intensive care unit. All patients were initially intubated and received mechanical ventilation. These trials evaluated the sedative properties of Precedex by comparing the amount of rescue medication (midazolam in one trial and propofol in the second) required to achieve a specified level of sedation (using the standardized Ramsay Sedation Scale) between Precedex and placebo from onset of treatment to extubation or to a total treatment duration of 24 hours. The Ramsay Level of Sedation Scale is displayed in Table 9.

In the first study, 175 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 178 to receive Precedex by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr (with allowed adjustment between 0.2 and 0.7 mcg/kg/hr) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg/kg intravenous over 10 minutes. The study drug infusion rate was adjusted to maintain a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3. Patients were allowed to receive "rescue" midazolam as needed to augment the study drug infusion. In addition, morphine sulfate was administered for pain as needed. The primary outcome measure for this study was the total amount of rescue medication (midazolam) needed to maintain sedation as specified while intubated. Patients randomized to placebo received significantly more midazolam than patients randomized to Precedex (see Table 10).
A second prospective primary analysis assessed the sedative effects of Precedex by comparing the percentage of patients who achieved a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3 during intubation without the use of additional rescue medication. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the Precedex group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3 without receiving any midazolam rescue compared to the placebo group (see Table 10).

A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the Precedex and placebo groups. On average, Precedex-treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo-treated patients (0.47 versus 0.83 mg/h). In addition, 44% (79 of 178 patients) of Precedex patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 19% (33 of 175 patients) in the placebo group.
In a second study, 198 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 203 to receive Precedex by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr (with allowed adjustment between 0.2 and 0.7 mcg/kg/hr) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg/kg intravenous over 10 minutes. The study drug infusion was adjusted to maintain a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3. Patients were allowed to receive "rescue" propofol as needed to augment the study drug infusion. In addition, morphine sulfate was administered as needed for pain. The primary outcome measure for this study was the total amount of rescue medication (propofol) needed to maintain sedation as specified while intubated.
Patients randomized to placebo received significantly more propofol than patients randomized to Precedex (see Table 11).
A significantly greater percentage of patients in the Precedex group compared to the placebo group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3 without receiving any propofol rescue (see Table 11).

A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the Precedex and placebo groups. On average, Precedex-treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo-treated patients (0.43 versus 0.89 mg/h). In addition, 41% (83 of 203 patients) of Precedex patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 15% (30 of 198 patients) in the placebo group.
In a controlled clinical trial, Precedex was compared to midazolam for ICU sedation exceeding 24 hours duration. Precedex was not shown to be superior to midazolam for the primary efficacy endpoint, the percent of time patients were adequately sedated (81% versus 81%). In addition, administration of Precedex for longer than 24 hours was associated with tolerance, tachyphylaxis, and a dose-related increase in adverse events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Procedural Sedation
The safety and efficacy of Precedex for sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials. Study 1 evaluated the sedative properties of Precedex in patients having a variety of elective surgeries/procedures performed under monitored anesthesia care. Study 2 evaluated Precedex in patients undergoing awake fiberoptic intubation prior to a surgical or diagnostic procedure.
In Study 1, the sedative properties of Precedex were evaluated by comparing the percent of patients not requiring rescue midazolam to achieve a specified level of sedation using the standardized Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (see Table 12).

Patients were randomized to receive a loading infusion of either Precedex 1 mcg/kg, Precedex 0.5 mcg/kg, or placebo (normal saline) given over 10 minutes and followed by a maintenance infusion started at 0.6 mcg/kg/hr. The maintenance infusion of study drug could be titrated from 0.2 mcg/kg/hr to 1 mcg/kg/hr to achieve the targeted sedation score (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale ≤4). Patients were allowed to receive rescue midazolam as needed to achieve and/or maintain an Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale ≤4. After achieving the desired level of sedation, a local or regional anesthetic block was performed. Demographic characteristics were similar between the Precedex and comparator groups. Efficacy results showed that Precedex was more effective than the comparator group when used to sedate non-intubated patients requiring monitored anesthesia care during surgical and other procedures (see Table 13).
In Study 2, the sedative properties of Precedex were evaluated by comparing the percent of patients requiring rescue midazolam to achieve or maintain a specified level of sedation using the Ramsay Sedation Scale score ≥2 (see Table 9). Patients were randomized to receive a loading infusion of Precedex 1 mcg/kg or placebo (normal saline) given over 10 minutes and followed by a fixed maintenance infusion of 0.7 mcg/kg/hr. After achieving the desired level of sedation, topicalization of the airway occurred. Patients were allowed to receive rescue midazolam as needed to achieve and/or maintain a Ramsay Sedation Scale ≥2. Demographic characteristics were similar between the Precedex and comparator groups. For efficacy results see Table 13.

 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 



      •
     

      Monitoring: Continuously monitor patients while receiving Precedex. (
      5.1) 
     

      •
     

      Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest: Have occurred in young healthy volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration, e.g., rapid intravenous or bolus administration. (
      5.2)
     

      •
     

      Hypotension and Bradycardia: May necessitate medical intervention. May be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension, and in the elderly. Use with caution in patients with advanced heart block or severe ventricular dysfunction. (
      5.2)
     

      •
     

      Co-administration with Other Vasodilators or Negative Chronotropic Agents: Use with caution due to additive pharmacodynamic effects. (
      5.2)
     

      •
     

      Transient Hypertension: Observed primarily during the loading dose. Consider reduction in loading infusion rate. (
      5.3)
     

      •
     

      Arousability: Patients can become aroused/alert with stimulation; this alone should not be considered as lack of efficacy. (
      5.4)

2.2 Dosage Information



Table 1: Dosage Information







  INDICATION  
  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  


  Initiation of Intensive Care Unit Sedation  
  For adult patients: a loading infusion of one mcg/kg over 10 minutes.  For adult patients being converted from alternate sedative therapy: a loading dose may not be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].  For patients over 65 years of age: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].  For adult patients with impaired hepatic-function: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


  Maintenance of Intensive Care Unit Sedation  
  For adult patients: a maintenance infusion of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hour. The rate of the maintenance infusion should be adjusted to achieve the desired level of sedation.  For patients over 65 years of age: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].   For adult patients with impaired hepatic function: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 


  Initiation of Procedural Sedation  
  For adult patients: a loading infusion of one mcg/kg over 10 minutes. For less invasive procedures such as ophthalmic surgery, a loading infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg given over 10 minutes may be suitable.  For awake fiberoptic intubation in adult patients: a loading infusion of one mcg/kg over 10 minutes.  For patients over 65 years of age: a loading infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg over 10 minutes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].   For adult patients with impaired hepatic function: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


  Maintenance of Procedural Sedation  
  For adult patients: the maintenance infusion is generally initiated at 0.6 mcg/kg/hour and titrated to achieve desired clinical effect with doses ranging from 0.2 to 1 mcg/kg/hour. The rate of the maintenance infusion should be adjusted to achieve the targeted level of sedation.   For awake fiberoptic intubation in adult patients: a maintenance infusion of 0.7 mcg/kg/hour is recommended until the endotracheal tube is secured.  For patients over 65 years of age: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].   For adult patients with impaired hepatic function: a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 









2.3 Dosage Adjustment
Due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, a reduction in dosage of Precedex or other concomitant anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics or opioids may be required when co-administered [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
Dosage reductions may need to be considered for adult patients with hepatic impairment, and geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





2.4 Preparation of Solution
Strict aseptic technique must always be maintained during handling of Precedex.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
 Precedex Injection, 200 mcg/2 mL (100 mcg/mL) 
Precedex must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection to achieve required concentration (4 mcg/mL) prior to administration. Preparation of solutions is the same, whether for the loading dose or maintenance infusion.
To prepare the infusion, withdraw 2 mL of Precedex Injection, and add to 48 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection to a total of 50 mL. Shake gently to mix well.
 Precedex in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 80 mcg/20 mL (4 mcg/mL), 200 mcg/50 mL (4 mcg/mL) and 400 mcg/100 mL (4 mcg/mL) 
Precedex in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is supplied in glass containers containing a premixed, ready to use dexmedetomidine hydrochloride solution in 0.9% sodium chloride in water. No further dilution of these preparations are necessary.





2.5 Administration with Other Fluids
Precedex infusion should not be co-administered through the same intravenous catheter with blood or plasma because physical compatibility has not been established. 
Precedex has been shown to be incompatible when administered with the following drugs: amphotericin B, diazepam.
Precedex has been shown to be compatible when administered with the following intravenous fluids:


     •
    

     0.9% sodium chloride in water 
    

     •
    

     5% dextrose in water 
    

     •
    

     20% mannitol 
    

     •
    

     Lactated Ringer's solution 
    

     •
    

     100 mg/mL magnesium sulfate solution 
    

     •
    

     0.3% potassium chloride solution
    






2.6 Compatibility with Natural Rubber
Compatibility studies have demonstrated the potential for absorption of Precedex to some types of natural rubber. Although Precedex is dosed to effect, it is advisable to use administration components made with synthetic or coated natural rubber gaskets.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS








5.1 Drug Administration
Precedex should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting. Due to the known pharmacological effects of Precedex, patients should be continuously monitored while receiving Precedex.





5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest
Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with Precedex administration in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration.
Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with Precedex infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of Precedex, increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because Precedex has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of Precedex-induced bradycardia. However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required.
Caution should be exercised when administering Precedex to patients with advanced heart block and/or severe ventricular dysfunction. Because Precedex decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients.
In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with Precedex an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed. Nonetheless, caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with Precedex.





5.3 Transient Hypertension
Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of Precedex. Treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary, although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable.





5.4 Arousability
Some patients receiving Precedex have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms.





5.5 Withdrawal
 Intensive Care Unit Sedation 
With administration up to 7 days, regardless of dose, 12 (5%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 (3%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug. The most common events were nausea, vomiting, and agitation. 
In adult subjects, tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of <5%. If tachycardia and/or hypertension occurs after discontinuation of Precedex supportive therapy is indicated.
 Procedural Sedation 
In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short term infusions of Precedex (<6 hours).





5.6 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis
Use of dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].





5.7 Hepatic Impairment
Since Precedex clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Close
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS








6.1 Clinical Studies Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
Use of Precedex has been associated with the following serious adverse reactions:


     •
    

     Hypotension, bradycardia and sinus arrest [
     see 
     Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
    

     •
    

     Transient hypertension [
     see 
     Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
    

Most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions, occurring in greater than 2% of patients in both Intensive Care Unit and procedural sedation studies include hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth. 
 Intensive Care Unit Sedation  
Adverse reaction information is derived from the continuous infusion trials of Precedex for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit setting in which 1007 adult patients received Precedex. The mean total dose was 7.4 mcg/kg (range: 0.8 to 84.1), mean dose per hour was 0.5 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.1 to 6.0) and the mean duration of infusion of 15.9 hours (range: 0.2 to 157.2). The population was between 17 to 88 years of age, 43% ≥65 years of age, 77% male and 93% Caucasian. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of >2% are provided in Table 2. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

 Procedural Sedation 
Adverse reaction information is derived from the two trials for procedural sedation [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] in which 318 adult patients received Precedex. The mean total dose was 1.6 mcg/kg (range: 0.5 to 6.7), mean dose per hour was 1.3 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.3 to 6.1) and the mean duration of infusion of 1.5 hours (range: 0.1 to 6.2). The population was between 18 to 93 years of age, ASA I-IV, 30% ≥65 years of age, 52% male and 61% Caucasian. 
Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of >2% are provided in Table 6. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Pre-specified criteria for the vital signs to be reported as adverse reactions are footnoted below the table.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Precedex. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. 
Hypotension and bradycardia were the most common adverse reactions associated with the use of Precedex during post approval use of the drug.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS








7.1 Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids
Co-administration of Precedex with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between Precedex and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with Precedex, a reduction in dosage of Precedex or the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required.





7.2 Neuromuscular Blockers
In one study of 10 healthy adult volunteers, administration of Precedex for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of one ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS








8.1 Pregnancy
 Pregnancy Category C  
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Precedex use in pregnant women. In an in vitro human placenta study, placental transfer of dexmedetomidine occurred. In a study in the pregnant rat, placental transfer of dexmedetomidine was observed when radiolabeled dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously. Thus, fetal exposure should be expected in humans, and Precedex should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus.
Teratogenic effects were not observed in rats following subcutaneous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis (from gestation day 5 to 16) with doses up to 200 mcg/kg (representing a dose approximately equal to the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or in rabbits following intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis (from gestation day 6 to 18) with doses up to 96 mcg/kg (representing approximately half the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose based on plasma area under the time-curve comparison). However, fetal toxicity, as evidenced by increased post-implantation losses and reduced live pups, was observed in rats at a subcutaneous dose of 200 mcg/kg. The no-effect dose in rats was 20 mcg/kg (representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison). In another reproductive toxicity study when dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats at 8 and 32 mcg/kg (representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison) from gestation day 16 through weaning, lower offspring weights were observed. Additionally, when offspring of the 32 mcg/kg group were allowed to mate, elevated fetal and embryocidal toxicity and delayed motor development was observed in second generation offspring.





8.2 Labor and Delivery
The safety of Precedex during labor and delivery has not been studied.





8.3 Nursing Mothers
It is not known whether Precedex is excreted in human milk. Radio-labeled dexmedetomidine administered subcutaneously to lactating female rats was excreted in milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Precedex is administered to a nursing woman.





8.4 Pediatric Use
Safety and efficacy have not been established for Procedural or ICU Sedation in pediatric patients. One assessor-blinded trial in pediatric patients and two open label studies in neonates were conducted to assess efficacy for ICU sedation. These studies did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints and the safety data submitted were insufficient to fully characterize the safety profile of Precedex for this patient population. The use of Precedex for procedural sedation in pediatric patients has not been evaluated.





8.5 Geriatric Use
 Intensive Care Unit Sedation  
A total of 729 patients in the clinical studies were 65 years of age and over. A total of 200 patients were 75 years of age and over. In patients greater than 65 years of age, a higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was observed following administration of Precedex [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Therefore a dose reduction may be considered in patients over 65 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
 Procedural Sedation 
A total of 131 patients in the clinical studies were 65 years of age and over. A total of 47 patients were 75 years of age and over. Hypotension occurred in a higher incidence in Precedex-treated patients 65 years or older (72%) and 75 years or older (74%) as compared to patients <65 years (47%). A reduced loading dose of 0.5 mcg/kg given over 10 minutes is recommended and a reduction in the maintenance infusion should be considered for patients greater than 65 years of age.





8.6 Hepatic Impairment
Since Precedex clearance decreases with increasing severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Close
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE








9.1 Controlled Substance
Precedex (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) is not a controlled substance.





9.3 Dependence
The dependence potential of Precedex has not been studied in humans. However, since studies in rodents and primates have demonstrated that Precedex exhibits pharmacologic actions similar to those of clonidine, it is possible that Precedex may produce a clonidine-like withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Close
10 OVERDOSAGE




The tolerability of Precedex was studied in one study in which healthy adult subjects were administered doses at and above the recommended dose of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr. The maximum blood concentration achieved in this study was approximately 13 times the upper boundary of the therapeutic range. The most notable effects observed in two subjects who achieved the highest doses were first degree atrioventricular block and second degree heart block. No hemodynamic compromise was noted with the atrioventricular block and the heart block resolved spontaneously within one minute. 
Five adult patients received an overdose of Precedex in the intensive care unit sedation studies. Two of these patients had no symptoms reported; one patient received a 2 mcg/kg loading dose over 10 minutes (twice the recommended loading dose) and one patient received a maintenance infusion of 0.8 mcg/kg/hr. Two other patients who received a 2 mcg/kg loading dose over 10 minutes, experienced bradycardia and/or hypotension. One patient who received a loading bolus dose of undiluted Precedex (19.4 mcg/kg), had cardiac arrest from which he was successfully resuscitated.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY








12.1 Mechanism of Action
Precedex is a relatively selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist with sedative properties. Alpha2 selectivity is observed in animals following slow intravenous infusion of low and medium doses (10-300 mcg/kg). Both alpha1 and alpha2 activity is observed following slow intravenous infusion of high doses (≥1000 mcg/kg) or with rapid intravenous administration.





12.2 Pharmacodynamics
In a study in healthy volunteers (N = 10), respiratory rate and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits and there was no evidence of respiratory depression when Precedex was administered by intravenous infusion at doses within the recommended dose range (0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr).





12.3 Pharmacokinetics
Following intravenous administration, dexmedetomidine exhibits the following pharmacokinetic parameters: a rapid distribution phase with a distribution half-life (t1/2) of approximately 6 minutes; a terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of approximately 2 hours; and steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of approximately 118 liters. Clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L/h. The mean body weight associated with this clearance estimate was 72 kg.
Dexmedetomidine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the dosage range of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr when administered by intravenous infusion for up to 24 hours. Table 8 shows the main pharmacokinetic parameters when Precedex was infused (after appropriate loading doses) at maintenance infusion rates of 0.17 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 0.3 ng/mL) for 12 and 24 hours, 0.33 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 0.6 ng/mL) for 24 hours, and 0.70 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 1.25 ng/mL) for 24 hours.

The loading doses for each of the above indicated groups were 0.5, 0.5, 1 and 2.2 mcg/kg, respectively.
Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic parameters after Precedex maintenance doses of 0.2 to 1.4 mcg/kg/hr for >24 hours were similar to the PK parameters after Precedex maintenance dosing for < 24 hours in other studies. The values for clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V), and t1/2 were 39.4 L/hr, 152 L, and 2.67 hours, respectively.
 Distribution 
The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of dexmedetomidine was approximately 118 liters. Dexmedetomidine protein binding was assessed in the plasma of normal healthy male and female subjects. The average protein binding was 94% and was constant across the different plasma concentrations tested. Protein binding was similar in males and females. The fraction of Precedex that was bound to plasma proteins was significantly decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects.
The potential for protein binding displacement of dexmedetomidine by fentanyl, ketorolac, theophylline, digoxin and lidocaine was explored in vitro, and negligible changes in the plasma protein binding of Precedex were observed. The potential for protein binding displacement of phenytoin, warfarin, ibuprofen, propranolol, theophylline and digoxin by Precedex was explored in vitro and none of these compounds appeared to be significantly displaced by Precedex.
 Metabolism 
Dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexmedetomidine excreted in urine and feces. Biotransformation involves both direct glucuronidation as well as cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism. The major metabolic pathways of dexmedetomidine are: direct N-glucuronidation to inactive metabolites; aliphatic hydroxylation (mediated primarily by CYP2A6 with a minor role of CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) of dexmedetomidine to generate 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, the glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, and 3-carboxy-dexmedetomidine; and N-methylation of dexmedetomidine to generate 3-hydroxy N-methyl-dexmedetomidine, 3-carboxy N-methyl-dexmedetomidine, and dexmedetomidine-N-methyl O-glucuronide.
 Elimination 
The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of dexmedetomidine is approximately 2 hours and clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L/h. A mass balance study demonstrated that after nine days an average of 95% of the radioactivity, following intravenous administration of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine, was recovered in the urine and 4% in the feces. No unchanged dexmedetomidine was detected in the urine. Approximately 85% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted within 24 hours after the infusion. Fractionation of the radioactivity excreted in urine demonstrated that products of N-glucuronidation accounted for approximately 34% of the cumulative urinary excretion. In addition, aliphatic hydroxylation of parent drug to form 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, the glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, and 3-carboxylic acid-dexmedetomidine together represented approximately 14% of the dose in urine. N-methylation of dexmedetomidine to form 3-hydroxy N-methyl dexmedetomidine, 3-carboxy N-methyl dexmedetomidine, and N-methyl O-glucuronide dexmedetomidine accounted for approximately 18% of the dose in urine. The N-Methyl metabolite itself was a minor circulating component and was undetected in urine. Approximately 28% of the urinary metabolites have not been identified.
 Gender 
There was no observed difference in Precedex pharmacokinetics due to gender.
 Geriatrics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of Precedex was not altered by age. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of Precedex in young (18–40 years), middle age (41–65 years), and elderly (>65 years) subjects.
 Hepatic Impairment 
In subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C), clearance values for Precedex were lower than in healthy subjects. The mean clearance values for patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were 74%, 64% and 53% of those observed in the normal healthy subjects, respectively. Mean clearances for free drug were 59%, 51% and 32% of those observed in the normal healthy subjects, respectively.
Although Precedex is dosed to effect, it may be necessary to consider dose reduction in subjects with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
 Renal Impairment 
Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics (Cmax, Tmax, AUC, t1/2, CL, and Vss) were not significantly different in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance: <30 mL/min) compared to healthy subjects. 
 Drug Interactions 
 In vitro studies: In vitro studies in human liver microsomes demonstrated no evidence of cytochrome P450 mediated drug interactions that are likely to be of clinical relevance.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY








13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
Animal carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with dexmedetomidine.
Dexmedetomidine was not mutagenic in vitro, in either the bacterial reverse mutation assay (E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium) or the mammalian cell forward mutation assay (mouse lymphoma). Dexmedetomidine was clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test with, but not without, rat S9 metabolic activation. In contrast, dexmedetomidine was not clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test with or without human S9 metabolic activation. Although dexmedetomidine was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test in NMRI mice, there was no evidence of clastogenicity in CD-1 mice. 
Fertility in male or female rats was not affected after daily subcutaneous injections of dexmedetomidine at doses up to 54 mcg/kg (less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose on a mcg/m2 basis) administered from 10 weeks prior to mating in males, and 3 weeks prior to mating and during mating in females.





13.2 Animal Pharmacology and/or Toxicology
There were no differences in the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol response in dogs following a single dose of dexmedetomidine compared to saline control. However, after continuous subcutaneous infusions of dexmedetomidine at 3 mcg/kg/hr and 10 mcg/kg/hr for one week in dogs (exposures estimated to be within the clinical range), the ACTH-stimulated cortisol response was diminished by approximately 27% and 40%, respectively, compared to saline-treated control animals indicating a dose-dependent adrenal suppression.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES




The safety and efficacy of Precedex has been evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials in 1185 adult patients.




14.1 Intensive Care Unit Sedation
Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials included 754 adult patients being treated in a surgical intensive care unit. All patients were initially intubated and received mechanical ventilation. These trials evaluated the sedative properties of Precedex by comparing the amount of rescue medication (midazolam in one trial and propofol in the second) required to achieve a specified level of sedation (using the standardized Ramsay Sedation Scale) between Precedex and placebo from onset of treatment to extubation or to a total treatment duration of 24 hours. The Ramsay Level of Sedation Scale is displayed in Table 9.

In the first study, 175 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 178 to receive Precedex by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr (with allowed adjustment between 0.2 and 0.7 mcg/kg/hr) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg/kg intravenous over 10 minutes. The study drug infusion rate was adjusted to maintain a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3. Patients were allowed to receive "rescue" midazolam as needed to augment the study drug infusion. In addition, morphine sulfate was administered for pain as needed. The primary outcome measure for this study was the total amount of rescue medication (midazolam) needed to maintain sedation as specified while intubated. Patients randomized to placebo received significantly more midazolam than patients randomized to Precedex (see Table 10).
A second prospective primary analysis assessed the sedative effects of Precedex by comparing the percentage of patients who achieved a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3 during intubation without the use of additional rescue medication. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the Precedex group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3 without receiving any midazolam rescue compared to the placebo group (see Table 10).

A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the Precedex and placebo groups. On average, Precedex-treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo-treated patients (0.47 versus 0.83 mg/h). In addition, 44% (79 of 178 patients) of Precedex patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 19% (33 of 175 patients) in the placebo group.
In a second study, 198 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 203 to receive Precedex by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr (with allowed adjustment between 0.2 and 0.7 mcg/kg/hr) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg/kg intravenous over 10 minutes. The study drug infusion was adjusted to maintain a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3. Patients were allowed to receive "rescue" propofol as needed to augment the study drug infusion. In addition, morphine sulfate was administered as needed for pain. The primary outcome measure for this study was the total amount of rescue medication (propofol) needed to maintain sedation as specified while intubated.
Patients randomized to placebo received significantly more propofol than patients randomized to Precedex (see Table 11).
A significantly greater percentage of patients in the Precedex group compared to the placebo group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3 without receiving any propofol rescue (see Table 11).

A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the Precedex and placebo groups. On average, Precedex-treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo-treated patients (0.43 versus 0.89 mg/h). In addition, 41% (83 of 203 patients) of Precedex patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 15% (30 of 198 patients) in the placebo group.
In a controlled clinical trial, Precedex was compared to midazolam for ICU sedation exceeding 24 hours duration. Precedex was not shown to be superior to midazolam for the primary efficacy endpoint, the percent of time patients were adequately sedated (81% versus 81%). In addition, administration of Precedex for longer than 24 hours was associated with tolerance, tachyphylaxis, and a dose-related increase in adverse events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].





14.2 Procedural Sedation
The safety and efficacy of Precedex for sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials. Study 1 evaluated the sedative properties of Precedex in patients having a variety of elective surgeries/procedures performed under monitored anesthesia care. Study 2 evaluated Precedex in patients undergoing awake fiberoptic intubation prior to a surgical or diagnostic procedure.
In Study 1, the sedative properties of Precedex were evaluated by comparing the percent of patients not requiring rescue midazolam to achieve a specified level of sedation using the standardized Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (see Table 12).

Patients were randomized to receive a loading infusion of either Precedex 1 mcg/kg, Precedex 0.5 mcg/kg, or placebo (normal saline) given over 10 minutes and followed by a maintenance infusion started at 0.6 mcg/kg/hr. The maintenance infusion of study drug could be titrated from 0.2 mcg/kg/hr to 1 mcg/kg/hr to achieve the targeted sedation score (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale ≤4). Patients were allowed to receive rescue midazolam as needed to achieve and/or maintain an Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale ≤4. After achieving the desired level of sedation, a local or regional anesthetic block was performed. Demographic characteristics were similar between the Precedex and comparator groups. Efficacy results showed that Precedex was more effective than the comparator group when used to sedate non-intubated patients requiring monitored anesthesia care during surgical and other procedures (see Table 13).
In Study 2, the sedative properties of Precedex were evaluated by comparing the percent of patients requiring rescue midazolam to achieve or maintain a specified level of sedation using the Ramsay Sedation Scale score ≥2 (see Table 9). Patients were randomized to receive a loading infusion of Precedex 1 mcg/kg or placebo (normal saline) given over 10 minutes and followed by a fixed maintenance infusion of 0.7 mcg/kg/hr. After achieving the desired level of sedation, topicalization of the airway occurred. Patients were allowed to receive rescue midazolam as needed to achieve and/or maintain a Ramsay Sedation Scale ≥2. Demographic characteristics were similar between the Precedex and comparator groups. For efficacy results see Table 13.

Why is DailyMed no longer displaying pill images on the Search Results and Drug Info pages?


            Due to inconsistencies between the drug labels on DailyMed and the pill images provided by RxImage, we no longer display the RxImage pill images associated with drug labels.
        

            We anticipate reposting the images once we are able identify and filter out images that do not match the information provided in the drug labels.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONS



IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Monitoring: Continuously monitor patients while receiving Precedex®. Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest: Have occurred in young healthy volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration, e.g., rapid intravenous or bolus administration.
Hypotension and Bradycardia: Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with Precedex® infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. May necessitate medical intervention. May be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension and in the elderly. Use with caution in patients with advanced heart block or severe ventricular dysfunction.
Co-administration With Other Vasodilators or Negative Chronotropic Agents: Use with caution due to additive pharmacodynamic effects.
Transient Hypertension: Observed primarily during the loading dose. Consider reduction in loading infusion rate.
Arousability: Patients can become aroused/alert with stimulation; this alone should not be considered lack of efficacy.
Prolonged exposure to dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours may be associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse events.
Withdrawal
Intensive Care Unit Sedation: With administration up to 7 days, regardless of dose, 12 (5%) Precedex® adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 (3%) Precedex® adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after the end of study drug. The most common events were nausea, vomiting, and agitation.
In adult subjects, tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of <5%. If tachycardia and/or hypertension occurs after discontinuation of Precedex®, supportive therapy is indicated.
Procedural Sedation: In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short-term infusions of Precedex® (<6 hours).
Specific Populations
Dosage reductions should be considered for adult patients with hepatic impairment and for geriatric patients.
Adverse Reactions
The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 2%) are hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth. Adverse reactions associated with infusions greater than 24 hours in duration include acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and agitation.
Drug Interactions
Co-administration of Precedex® with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between Precedex® and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with Precedex®, a reduction in dosage of Precedex® or the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic, or opioid may be required.
INDICATIONS
Precedex® (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) is a relatively selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist indicated for:

Sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in an intensive care setting. Administer Precedex® by continuous  infusion not to exceed 24 hours.
Sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures.

Precedex: Package Insert and Label InformationBy Hospira, Inc. | Last revised: 14 June 2017
PRECEDEX- dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection, solutionPRECEDEX- dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection, solution, concentrateHospira, Inc. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Intensive Care Unit Sedation PrecedexTM is indicated for sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in an intensive care setting. Precedex should be administered by continuous infusion not to exceed 24 hours.
Precedex has been continuously infused in mechanically ventilated patients prior to extubation, during extubation, and post-extubation. It is not necessary to discontinue Precedex prior to extubation.
1.2 Procedural Sedation 



Precedex is indicated for sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures.
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Dosing Guidelines  • Precedex dosing should be individualized and titrated to desired clinical response.  • Precedex is not indicated for infusions lasting longer than 24 hours.  • Precedex should be administered using a controlled infusion device. 2.2 Dosage Information   Table 1: Dosage Information         INDICATION  
    DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
      Initiation of Intensive Care Unit Sedation  
  For adult patients:  a loading infusion of one mcg/kg over 10 minutes .
For adult patients being converted from alternate sedative therapy:  a loading dose may not be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
For patients over 65 years of age:  a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
For adult patients with impaired hepatic-function:  a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
      Maintenance of Intensive Care Unit Sedation  
  For adult patients:  a maintenance infusion of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hour . The rate of the maintenance infusion should be adjusted to achieve the desired level of sedation.
For patients over 65 years of age:  a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 
For adult patients with impaired hepatic function:  a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
      Initiation of Procedural Sedation  
  For adult patients:  a loading infusion of one mcg/kg over 10 minutes . For less invasive procedures such as ophthalmic surgery, a loading infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg given over 10 minutes  may be suitable.
For awake fiberoptic intubation in adult patients:  a loading infusion of one mcg/kg over 10 minutes .
For patients over 65 years of age:  a loading infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg over 10 minutes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 
For adult patients with impaired hepatic function:  a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
      Maintenance of Procedural Sedation  
  For adult patients:  the maintenance infusion is generally initiated at 0.6 mcg/kg/hour  and titrated to achieve desired clinical effect with doses ranging from 0.2 to 1 mcg/kg/hour . The rate of the maintenance infusion should be adjusted to achieve the targeted level of sedation. 
For awake fiberoptic intubation in adult patients:  a maintenance infusion of 0.7 mcg/kg/hour  is recommended until the endotracheal tube is secured.
For patients over 65 years of age:  a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 
For adult patients with impaired hepatic function:  a dose reduction should be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
   2.3 Dosage Adjustment Due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, a reduction in dosage of Precedex or other concomitant anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics or opioids may be required when co-administered [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
Dosage reductions may need to be considered for adult patients with hepatic impairment, and geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
2.4 Preparation of Solution Strict aseptic technique must always be maintained during handling of Precedex.
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
  Precedex Injection, 200 mcg/2 mL (100 mcg/mL)  
Precedex must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection to achieve required concentration (4 mcg/mL) prior to administration. Preparation of solutions is the same, whether for the loading dose or maintenance infusion.
To prepare the infusion, withdraw 2 mL of Precedex Injection, and add to 48 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection to a total of 50 mL. Shake gently to mix well.
 Precedex in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 80 mcg/20 mL (4 mcg/mL), 200 mcg/50 mL (4 mcg/mL) and 400 mcg/100 mL (4 mcg/mL) 
Precedex in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is supplied in glass containers containing a premixed, ready to use dexmedetomidine hydrochloride solution in 0.9% sodium chloride in water. No further dilution of these preparations are necessary.
2.5 Administration with Other Fluids Precedex infusion should not be co-administered through the same intravenous catheter with blood or plasma because physical compatibility has not been established. 
Precedex has been shown to be incompatible when administered with the following drugs: amphotericin B, diazepam.
Precedex has been shown to be compatible when administered with the following intravenous fluids:
 • 0.9% sodium chloride in water  • 5% dextrose in water  • 20% mannitol  • Lactated Ringer’s solution  • 100 mg/mL magnesium sulfate solution  • 0.3% potassium chloride solution 2.6 Compatibility with Natural Rubber Compatibility studies have demonstrated the potential for absorption of Precedex to some types of natural rubber. Although Precedex is dosed to effect, it is advisable to use administration components made with synthetic or coated natural rubber gaskets.
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  Precedex Injection  
Precedex Injection, 200 mcg/2 mL dexmedetomidine (100 mcg/mL) in a glass vial. To be used after dilution.

Precedex Injection, 80 mcg dexmedetomidine/20 mL (4 mcg/mL) dexmedetomidine in a 20 mL glass vial. Ready to use.
Precedex Injection, 200 mcg dexmedetomidine/50 mL (4 mcg/mL) dexmedetomidine in a 50 mL glass bottle. Ready to use.
Precedex Injection, 400 mcg dexmedetomidine/100 mL (4 mcg/mL) dexmedetomidine in a 100 mL glass bottle. Ready to use.
4 CONTRAINDICATIONSNone
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Drug Administration Precedex should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting. Due to the known pharmacological effects of Precedex, patients should be continuously monitored while receiving Precedex.
5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with Precedex administration in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration.
Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with Precedex infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of Precedex, increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because Precedex has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of Precedex-induced bradycardia. However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required.
Caution should be exercised when administering Precedex to patients with advanced heart block and/or severe ventricular dysfunction. Because Precedex decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients.
In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with Precedex an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed. Nonetheless, caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with Precedex.
5.3 Transient Hypertension Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of Precedex. Treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary, although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable.
5.4 Arousability Some patients receiving Precedex have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms.
5.5 Withdrawal   Intensive Care Unit Sedation  
With administration up to 7 days, regardless of dose, 12 (5%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 (3%) Precedex adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug. The most common events were nausea, vomiting, and agitation. 
In adult subjects, tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of <5%. If tachycardia and/or hypertension occurs after discontinuation of Precedex supportive therapy is indicated.
  Procedural Sedation  
In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short term infusions of Precedex (<6 hours).
5.6 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis Use of dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
5.7 Hepatic Impairment Since Precedex clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
Use of Precedex has been associated with the following serious adverse reactions:
 • Hypotension, bradycardia and sinus arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] • Transient hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions, occurring in greater than 2% of patients in both Intensive Care Unit and procedural sedation studies include hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth. 
  Intensive Care Unit Sedation  
Adverse reaction information is derived from the continuous infusion trials of Precedex for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit setting in which 1007 adult patients received Precedex. The mean total dose was 7.4 mcg/kg (range: 0.8 to 84.1), mean dose per hour was 0.5 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.1 to 6.0) and the mean duration of infusion of 15.9 hours (range: 0.2 to 157.2). The population was between 17 to 88 years of age, 43% ≥65 years of age, 77% male and 93% Caucasian. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of >2% are provided in Table 2. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

   In a controlled clinical trial, Precedex was compared to midazolam for ICU sedation exceeding 24 hours duration in adult patients. Key treatment emergent adverse events occurring in dexmedetomidine or midazolam treated patients in the randomized active comparator continuous infusion long-term intensive care unit sedation study are provided in Table 4. The number (%) of subjects who had a dose-related increase in treatment-emergent adverse events by maintenance adjusted dose rate range in the Precedex group is provided in Table 5.   Table 4: Key Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Occurring in Dexmedetomidine- or Midazolam-Treated Adult Patients in the Randomized Active Comparator Continuous Infusion Long-Term Intensive Care Unit Sedation Study       †   Includes any type of hypertension.1   Hypotension was defined in absolute terms as Systolic blood pressure of <80 mmHg or Diastolic blood pressure of <50 mmHg or in relative terms as ≤30% lower than pre-study drug infusion value.2   Bradycardia was defined in absolute terms as <40 bpm or in relative terms as ≤30% lower than pre-study drug infusion value.3   Hypertension was defined in absolute terms as Systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg or Diastolic blood pressure of >100 mmHg or in relative terms as ≥30% higher than pre-study drug infusion value.4   Tachycardia was defined in absolute terms as >120 bpm or in relative terms as ≥30% greater than pre-study drug infusion value.

     Procedural Sedation  
Adverse reaction information is derived from the two trials for procedural sedation [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] in which 318 adult patients received Precedex. The mean total dose was 1.6 mcg/kg (range: 0.5 to 6.7), mean dose per hour was 1.3 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.3 to 6.1) and the mean duration of infusion of 1.5 hours (range: 0.1 to 6.2). The population was between 18 to 93 years of age, ASA I-IV, 30% ≥65 years of age, 52% male and 61% Caucasian. 
Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of >2% are provided in Table 6. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Pre-specified criteria for the vital signs to be reported as adverse reactions are footnoted below the table. The decrease in respiratory rate and hypoxia was similar between Precedex and comparator groups in both studies.   Table 6: Adverse Reactions With an Incidence > 2%—Procedural Sedation Population         Adverse Event     Precedex   (N = 318)   (%)     Placebo   (N = 113)   (%)       1   Hypotension was defined in absolute and relative terms as Systolic blood pressure of <80 mmHg or ≤30% lower than pre-study drug infusion value, or Diastolic blood pressure of <50 mmHg.2   Respiratory depression was defined in absolute and relative terms as respiratory rate (RR) <8 beats per minute or > 25% decrease from baseline.3   Bradycardia was defined in absolute and relative terms as <40 beats per minute or ≤30% lower than pre-study drug infusion value.4   Hypertension was defined in absolute and relative terms as Systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg or ≥30% higher than pre-study drug infusion value or Diastolic blood pressure of >100 mmHg.5   Tachycardia was defined in absolute and relative terms as >120 beats per minute or ≥30% greater than pre-study drug infusion value.6   Hypoxia was defined in absolute and relative terms as SpO2 <90% or 10% decrease from baseline.

About PREDEX
PREDEX is an interval fund designed to offer access to private core real estate through investment in flagship U.S. core property funds managed by leading institutional real estate sponsors. Most of the targeted institutional private funds are included in the NFI-ODCE Index (“ODCE Index”).1 The underlying institutional funds own high-quality office, industrial, retail and apartment properties primarily located across the top 25 U.S. metropolitan areas. Income from these properties (after expenses) is passed through the funds to PREDEX, which provides quarterly distributions to its shareholders.
How PREDEX Works

 
 
 
 

 





What is the ODCE Index?
PREDEX operates within the NFI-ODCE Index (“ODCE Index”) guidelines for leverage, property type and geographic diversification. Since 1978, the Index has been widely used to represent the stabilized, income-producing commercial and multi-family real estate market. Funds included in the Index invest in private equity real estate and operate under a strict set of criteria:

Real Estate. At least 80% of the market value of net assets must be invested in real estate, and no more than 20% in cash or cash equivalents.
Private Equity. At least 80% of the market value of real estate must be invested in private equity real estate properties, and no more than 20% in real estate debt instruments.
Domain. At least 95% of the market value of real estate must be invested in the U.S.
Property Types. At least 80% of the market value of real estate must be invested in office, industrial, apartment and retail properties.
Life Cycle. At least 80% of the market value of real estate must be invested in operating properties, and no more than 20% invested in (pre)development/redevelopment or initial leasing / lease-up.
Leverage / Debt. Leverage is limited to 40% of the market value of net assets.
Diversification. No more than 65% of the market value of real estate may be invested in one property type or one geographic region.

Funds in the ODCE Index must also comply with the NCREIF Real Estate Information Standards, including annual audits, quarterly valuations, and time-weighted returns.
 
 
 
 

 





The PREDEX Structure
PREDEX is designed to provide an institutional-quality real estate investment to investors.
PREDEX provides access to private core real estate through the convenience of a mutual fund. Please browse through the topics below to find out more about investing in PREDEX.
Fund Objective
PREDEX seeks stable income and long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of flagship U.S. core property funds managed by leading institutional real estate sponsors. Our underlying funds own interests in more than 1,400 properties valued at more than $100 billion.
Why can’t PREDEX be a pure index fund?
PREDEX cannot be a pure NFI-ODCE Index fund because to do so, it would have to own all of the member funds weighted by their net asset values—an impossible task due to the uneven timing of capital calls and quarterly liquidity. PREDEX seeks to be as close to a “beta” fund as possible and represent the characteristics of the NFI-ODCE Index.
Interval Funds and Redemptions
As an interval fund, PREDEX offers quarterly share repurchases for no less than 5% and no more than 25% of the Fund’s total shares outstanding. Share repurchases are offered at net asset value (NAV).
All of an investor’s tendered shares will be repurchased if the combined total shares tendered by all investors is less than the repurchase offer amount. If total shareholder requests exceed the repurchase offer amount, PREDEX will repurchase shares on a pro rata basis. There is no guarantee that an investor will be able to sell all shares in a repurchase offer. Quarterly share redemption is available throughout the life of the fund.
Daily NAV Pricing
Like open-end mutual funds, PREDEX provides transparency through daily pricing at net asset value (NAV). This is different from publicly traded real estate securities, which are priced based on daily trading activity. It is believed that appraisal NAV pricing may contribute to less volatility of PREDEX shares.
Fees
PREDEX offers a low-cost, passive (‘beta’) investment strategy, which means that management fees may be lower than those of other investment options. The annual asset management fee is 0.55%, with total annual fund expenses, including the management fee, estimated to be 1.00%, subject to a 1.20% limitation.
Minimum Initial Investment
While the minimum investment in PREDEX is $1,000,000, with pre-approval the minimum can be waived by the Advisor. Exceptions are available for registered investment advisors who aggregate accounts for the benefit of their clients.
Underlying Fund Sponsors
The target funds in which PREDEX invests are the flagship U.S. core property funds managed by leading institutional real estate sponsors including:

Take the Advantage Over Bugs. Pest control from Orkin can help you with not only the treatment of pests and termites - but also help prevent unwanted pest and termite presence later.

	Pest Control - Ants







































 




For your convenience and immediate attention, call  
pc














Ants Are No Picnic
They may be small, but they can cause big problems. Ants enter your home through the tiniest cracks. While doing so, they leave behind a scent so others of their like can follow the trail to food.
Most do-it-yourself approaches only kill the ants you see. To be truly effective, a treatment must penetrate and destroy the unseen nest, which could be in your walls or foundation. It's the only way to help prevent ants from returning.
The Advantage Over Ants
Pest control from Orkin can help you with not only the treatment of pests - but also help prevent unwanted pest presence later.
