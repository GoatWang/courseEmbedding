                                            We wish Todd and his family all best. No one can control the markets and for 13 years he did an amazing job for us. These bloodthirsty lawyers will stop at nothing to tarnish his name for their own gain.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

The biggest criminal and traitor having committed high treason is none other than cheetos jesus himself. You can find him in the white house tweeting at any moment. For some unknown reason the GOP is cowering in fear of this fraud. The trumpanzees just want someone to worship, even if it is an orange pile of #$%$. They want to express their anger at all other Americans for having elected Obama president, and their unjustified hate for Clinton. And if the Constituion, "Declaration of Independence", Comey, Colbert, or any other document, investigator, journalist, messengers, comedian, etc. happen to get in their way, they go into a fit of rage against them. They do NOT care if cheetos jesus sell off American to Russian, or if "R" in republican is now the same as "Russians". They just want to see the world burn because they are angry and #$%$ off at everything, and for others not respecting their special white snow flake status.Join the Conversation1 / 5665
