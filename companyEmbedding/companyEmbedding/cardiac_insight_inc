Innovation With Impact
 
Cardiac Insight is focused on developing advanced body-worn sensing and computing technologies for diagnostic testing in cardiology, respiratory and other complex disease states.
 












Our Process


Cardiac Insight seeks to do more than incrementally improve diagnostics and treatment, but rather to invent complete and novel solutions to unmet clinical needs. Our medical devices and systems are created utilizing the most advanced algorithms and software that provide improvements in mean time to diagnosis and treatment. Our innovations are designed to be physician- and patient-centric.















Our Focus


Our cardiac product development seeks to provide a single-use, point-of-care solution to the complex diagnostic process of arrhythmia identification using highly patient-compliant wearable technologies combined with proprietary systems that allow providers to produce complete interpretive results on site.











Cardea SOLO™ Wearable Sensor



The first wearable ECG sensor that provides physicians instant access to patient data, enhancing mean time-to-diagnosis and reducing the overall cost of patient care. The water-resistant, disposable sensor continuously records high-quality ECG data and integrates patient event markers throughout all daily activity.




Cardea SOLO™ Analysis



Cardea SOLO™ Smart Cable retrieves patient ECG data from the sensor right in the physician’s office without the need for costly and time-consuming outside data analysis centers. Recorded ECG signals are analyzed to provide comprehensive reports of heart rhythms captured for immediate review.




Cardea 20/20 ECG™



Cardea 20/20 ECG™ is the only system in the world designed specifically to support cost-effective cardiovascular assessment of youth for identification of risk factors associated with sudden death. Built upon the Refined Seattle Criteria—soon to be the International Criteria for ECG Interpretation in Athletes as defined by a think tank of cardiology, electrophysiology and sports medicine experts—Cardea 20/20 ECG™ raw abnormal rate is about 3 percent.

Report prints immediately in office for full reimbursement.1of1 The Story: Overview
The company’s atrial fibrillation product impacts the diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). This condition is significantly under-diagnosed and when left undetected can lead to significant increased risks of stroke and cardiovascular disease. The Company’s AF Patch product will be inexpensive (COGS less than $20/unit) and easy to use. Current technologies are cumbersome for the patient, and expensive both because of the hardware used and the need for trained technician overview. The earlier detection and treatment will also reduce the expensive costs associated with acute care of strokes and cardio vascular disease resulting from untreated patients. The licensed, proprietary algorithms used by the company allow automated screening with accuracy equivalent to that of trained technicians. Cardiac Insight was founded in 2008. In June 2010, angel investors provide an initial funding investment of $200,000 combined with an executed a technology license with the University of Washington for an atrial fibrillation detection algorithm. An additional $1.2M has been raised from private investors and $235,000 of previous development has come from grants/gifts (WRF, CAC, STTR). The company received FDA 510(k)  clearance for its ECG patch device (record only, 24 hours) in May, 2013.  Additional capital will be used to develop the commercial version of the atrial fibrillation product and pursue strategies for the development of two additional markets.
 
Products 
The simple Patch type product can improve the diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation. The product utilizes a highly accurate algorithm with 100% sensitivity. The device is designed for low power, battery operated applications and can be wearable for up to 7 days. The device will allow data to be directly downloaded with automatic report generation in a physician’s office; eliminating the need to send the device to a third-party service center that is standard practice today. In conjunction with a partner, the Company will also develop a 48-hour sleep apnea screening device similar in form factor to the atrial fibrillation device. Finally, the Company will license its implantable algorithm to reduce inappropriate shocks from ICD devices.

Cardiac Insight, Inc. Acquires Cardea Associates, Inc. to Bring Forth 
      New Standard of Care for Cardiac Screening in Young Athletes






October 01, 2015 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cardiac Insight, a University of Washington spinoff medical technology 
      company that develops advanced body worn sensing and computing 
      technologies for applications in the cardiology and respiratory markets, 
      announced today it has completed the acquisition of Cardea Associates, 
      Inc., a company dedicated to cardiovascular research and product 
      innovation. CardeaScreen™, developed and produced by Cardea, is a 
      proprietary, handheld 12-lead ECG device and software that provides a 
      major breakthrough to improve the reliability of the electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) for the identification of cardiovascular issues associated with 
      sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in young athletes.
    


      “Cardea Associates brings to market compelling ECG technologies that 
      greatly enhance the ECG data for the purpose of finding potential life 
      threatening conditions in young athletes,” said Brad Harlow, CEO of 
      Cardiac Insight. “For years we have known ECG data plays an important 
      role in distinguishing underlying cardiac risk, and the CardeaScreen™ 
      product is aligned very well with our field of expertise, providing an 
      excellent foundation for the introduction of our body worn sensing 
      technologies.”
    

      Cardiac Insight is developing advanced body worn ECG sensing technology 
      aimed at the early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) and other 
      conditions. This condition is significantly under-diagnosed and, when 
      left undetected, may lead to significant increased risk of stroke and 
      cardiovascular disease. The company’s sensor technology aims to 
      streamline the AF detection process for patients and physicians while 
      dramatically reducing equipment costs. Earlier last year the company 
      announced a strategic collaboration with Welch Allyn, now part of the 
      Hill-Rom family of companies, for the distribution rights of certain 
      products and technologies offered by Cardiac Insight.
    

      “Today’s announcement is a benchmark event for Cardea Associates and the 
      continued growth and utilization of the CardeaScreen product,” said 
      David Hadley PhD, President of Cardea Associates. “With the strength of 
      Cardiac Insight’s distribution partners we believe the CardeaScreen 
      product will become the standard of care for ECG screening to measure 
      the risk of sudden cardiac arrest in the athletic and medical markets.”
    

About Cardea Associates, Inc.


      Cardea Associates is dedicated to saving lives through cardiovascular 
      research and product innovation. The company works with research 
      partners, institutions and thought leaders around the world to improve 
      screening for heart health. CardeaScreen™ is a proprietary diagnostic 
      product that measures and records the electrical activity of the heart 
      and aids the physician to make a determination of the risks associated 
      with sudden cardiac arrest.
