Early life and education[edit]
Rometty graduated from the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University in 1979 with high honors, receiving a bachelor's degree in computer science and electrical engineering.[16] Rometty was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, eventually serving as its president.[17]
Career[edit]
After graduation in 1979, Rometty went to work for General Motors Institute; in 1981, she joined IBM as a systems engineer in its Detroit office.[18] She joined IBM's Consulting Group in 1991. In 2002, she "championed the purchase of the big business consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting, for $3.5 billion."[19] Rometty became senior vice president and group executive for sales, marketing, and strategy in 2009[18] and is "credited with spearheading IBM's growth strategy by getting the company into the cloud computing and analytics businesses. She was also at the helm of readying Watson, the Jeopardy! playing computer, for commercial use."[20]
On October 25, 2011, IBM announced that she was to be the company's next president and CEO, with Sam Palmisano stepping down but retaining his position as chairman.[18] Rometty's appointment marks the first time a woman has been CEO of IBM.[6] Regarding her promotion, Palmisano stated, "Ginni got it because she deserved it... It’s got zero to do with progressive social policies."[19]
On September 26, 2012, IBM announced that Rometty was taking on the added role of chairman of IBM, as Samuel Palmisano prepared to retire at the end of 2012. Rometty commenced her duty as chairman, president, and CEO of IBM on October 1, 2012.[7] One of her goals is to focus company efforts on the cloud and cognitive computing systems, such as Watson.[21]
On March 17, 2017, Rometty, who is a part of a White House business-advisory council under the Trump Administration, was included in a business leaders' symposium during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to Washington.[22]
Boards and honors[edit]
Rometty serves on the Council on Foreign Relations; the Board of Trustees of her alma mater Northwestern University; the Board of Overseers and Board of Managers of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center;[23] and is a council member at the Latin America Conservation Council, a subsidiary of The Nature Conservancy.[24] She also served on the Board of Directors of AIG from 2006 until 2009.[25]
In 2014, Rometty was featured in the PBS documentary The Boomer List.[26] Also that year, she became the third female member of the Augusta National Golf Club.[27] She has received honorary doctoral degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (2014) and Northwestern University (2015).[28][29]
In Fortune's September 15, 2015 issue, Rometty ranked 3rd on their Most Powerful Women List.[21]
Named the 11th most powerful woman on the 2016 Forbes list: The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.[30]
Criticism[edit]
Over Rometty's tenure as CEO she has been met by increasing criticism, most notably a confrontation with Mark Cuban, who said she had lacked vision, with IBM losing revenue now for 20 consecutive quarters in a row.[31] IBM employees have also criticized her for taking pay bonuses despite massive layoffs of IBM employees, and poor performance.[32][33] Rometty has been named among the worst CEO's by several publications including the Motley Fool, 24/7 Wallstreet, Forbes, and the Wall Street Journal. [34][35][36][37]
Personal life[edit]
Rometty is married to Mark Anthony Rometty, a principal investor in the Bam Oil Company. The couple has no children.[38]

Virginia Marie "Ginni" Rometty (born July 29, 1957)[4][5] is an American business executive.

She joined IBM as a systems engineer in its Detroit office in 1981.
Rometty's tenure as CEO has been marked by prestigious awards including by Bloomberg who named her among the 50 Most Influential People in the World,[8][9][10] and Fortune naming her among the "50 Most Powerful Women in Business" for ten consecutive years.[11][12] Her tenure as CEO has been met by criticism related to executive compensation and outsourcing,[13][14] and IBM's 21 consecutive quarters of revenue decline.[15]

Early life and education[edit]
Rometty graduated from the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University in 1979 with high honors, receiving a bachelor's degree in computer science and electrical engineering.[16] Rometty was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, eventually serving as its president.[17]
Career[edit]
After graduation in 1979, Rometty went to work for General Motors Institute; in 1981, she joined IBM as a systems engineer in its Detroit office.[18] She joined IBM's Consulting Group in 1991. In 2002, she "championed the purchase of the big business consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting, for $3.5 billion."[19] Rometty became senior vice president and group executive for sales, marketing, and strategy in 2009[18] and is "credited with spearheading IBM's growth strategy by getting the company into the cloud computing and analytics businesses. She was also at the helm of readying Watson, the Jeopardy! playing computer, for commercial use."[20]
On October 25, 2011, IBM announced that she was to be the company's next president and CEO, with Sam Palmisano stepping down but retaining his position as chairman.[18] Rometty's appointment marks the first time a woman has been CEO of IBM.[6] Regarding her promotion, Palmisano stated, "Ginni got it because she deserved it... It’s got zero to do with progressive social policies."[19]
On September 26, 2012, IBM announced that Rometty was taking on the added role of chairman of IBM, as Samuel Palmisano prepared to retire at the end of 2012. Rometty commenced her duty as chairman, president, and CEO of IBM on October 1, 2012.[7] One of her goals is to focus company efforts on the cloud and cognitive computing systems, such as Watson.[21]
On March 17, 2017, Rometty, who is a part of a White House business-advisory council under the Trump Administration, was included in a business leaders' symposium during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to Washington.[22]
Boards and honors[edit]
Rometty serves on the Council on Foreign Relations; the Board of Trustees of her alma mater Northwestern University; the Board of Overseers and Board of Managers of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center;[23] and is a council member at the Latin America Conservation Council, a subsidiary of The Nature Conservancy.[24] She also served on the Board of Directors of AIG from 2006 until 2009.[25]
In 2014, Rometty was featured in the PBS documentary The Boomer List.[26] Also that year, she became the third female member of the Augusta National Golf Club.[27] She has received honorary doctoral degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (2014) and Northwestern University (2015).[28][29]
In Fortune's September 15, 2015 issue, Rometty ranked 3rd on their Most Powerful Women List.[21]
Named the 11th most powerful woman on the 2016 Forbes list: The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.[30]
Criticism[edit]
Over Rometty's tenure as CEO she has been met by increasing criticism, most notably a confrontation with Mark Cuban, who said she had lacked vision, with IBM losing revenue now for 20 consecutive quarters in a row.[31] IBM employees have also criticized her for taking pay bonuses despite massive layoffs of IBM employees, and poor performance.[32][33] Rometty has been named among the worst CEO's by several publications including the Motley Fool, 24/7 Wallstreet, Forbes, and the Wall Street Journal. [34][35][36][37]
Personal life[edit]
Rometty is married to Mark Anthony Rometty, a principal investor in the Bam Oil Company. The couple has no children.[38]

Virginia Marie "Ginni" Rometty (born July 29, 1957)[4][5] is an American business executive. She is the current chairman, president, and CEO of IBM, and the first woman to head the company.[6][7] Prior to becoming president and CEO in January 2012, she held the positions of senior vice president and group executive for sales, marketing, and strategy at IBM. She joined IBM as a systems engineer in its Detroit office in 1981.
Rometty's tenure as CEO has been marked by prestigious awards including by Bloomberg who named her among the 50 Most Influential People in the World,[8][9][10] and Fortune naming her among the "50 Most Powerful Women in Business" for ten consecutive years.[11][12] Her tenure as CEO has been met by criticism related to executive compensation and outsourcing,[13][14] and IBM's 21 consecutive quarters of revenue decline.[15]

Early life and education[edit]
Rometty graduated from the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University in 1979 with high honors, receiving a bachelor's degree in computer science and electrical engineering.[16] Rometty was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, eventually serving as its president.[17]
Career[edit]
After graduation in 1979, Rometty went to work for General Motors Institute; in 1981, she joined IBM as a systems engineer in its Detroit office.[18] She joined IBM's Consulting Group in 1991. In 2002, she "championed the purchase of the big business consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting, for $3.5 billion."[19] Rometty became senior vice president and group executive for sales, marketing, and strategy in 2009[18] and is "credited with spearheading IBM's growth strategy by getting the company into the cloud computing and analytics businesses. She was also at the helm of readying Watson, the Jeopardy! playing computer, for commercial use."[20]
On October 25, 2011, IBM announced that she was to be the company's next president and CEO, with Sam Palmisano stepping down but retaining his position as chairman.[18] Rometty's appointment marks the first time a woman has been CEO of IBM.[6] Regarding her promotion, Palmisano stated, "Ginni got it because she deserved it... It’s got zero to do with progressive social policies."[19]
On September 26, 2012, IBM announced that Rometty was taking on the added role of chairman of IBM, as Samuel Palmisano prepared to retire at the end of 2012. Rometty commenced her duty as chairman, president, and CEO of IBM on October 1, 2012.[7] One of her goals is to focus company efforts on the cloud and cognitive computing systems, such as Watson.[21]
On March 17, 2017, Rometty, who is a part of a White House business-advisory council under the Trump Administration, was included in a business leaders' symposium during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to Washington.[22]
Boards and honors[edit]
Rometty serves on the Council on Foreign Relations; the Board of Trustees of her alma mater Northwestern University; the Board of Overseers and Board of Managers of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center;[23] and is a council member at the Latin America Conservation Council, a subsidiary of The Nature Conservancy.[24] She also served on the Board of Directors of AIG from 2006 until 2009.[25]
In 2014, Rometty was featured in the PBS documentary The Boomer List.[26] Also that year, she became the third female member of the Augusta National Golf Club.[27] She has received honorary doctoral degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (2014) and Northwestern University (2015).[28][29]
In Fortune's September 15, 2015 issue, Rometty ranked 3rd on their Most Powerful Women List.[21]
Named the 11th most powerful woman on the 2016 Forbes list: The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.[30]
Criticism[edit]
Over Rometty's tenure as CEO she has been met by increasing criticism, most notably a confrontation with Mark Cuban, who said she had lacked vision, with IBM losing revenue now for 20 consecutive quarters in a row.[31] IBM employees have also criticized her for taking pay bonuses despite massive layoffs of IBM employees, and poor performance.[32][33] Rometty has been named among the worst CEO's by several publications including the Motley Fool, 24/7 Wallstreet, Forbes, and the Wall Street Journal. [34][35][36][37]
Personal life[edit]
Rometty is married to Mark Anthony Rometty, a principal investor in the Bam Oil Company. The couple has no children.[38]

Virginia M. Rometty, a senior vice president at I.B.M., will be the company’s next chief executive, the directors announced on Tuesday. She will succeed Samuel J. Palmisano, 60, who will remain as chairman, at the start of next year.Ms. Rometty, 54, is well known within the technology industry, but not widely beyond. She has led strategically important divisions of the company as it has shifted to services and products with high profit margins, like software that mines vast troves of corporate and online data for sales and cost-saving opportunities.The directors’ choice of Ms. Rometty, who managed a crucial merger as well as sales in fast-growing new markets, ends a competition that has been under way for years. The leading candidates were always from within the company’s executive ranks.A leading rival to succeed Mr. Palmisano, analysts say, was Steven A. Mills, the senior vice president who led I.B.M.’s highly profitable and growing software division. But his age, analysts note, was probably an obstacle. Mr. Mills has just turned 60, the traditional retirement age for I.B.M. chief executives.

 Mr. Palmisano, in an interview Tuesday, singled out Mr. Mills for praise, saying “he’s done a phenomenal job.” Continue reading the main story

The selection of Ms. Rometty for the top job at I.B.M. will make her one of the most prominent women executives in corporate America, joining a small group of chiefs that includes Ursula Burns of Xerox, Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, Ellen J. Kullman of DuPont and Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard. Gender, according to Mr. Palmisano, did not figure into Ms. Rometty’s selection.“Ginni got it because she deserved it,” Mr. Palmisano said, using the informal first name by which she is known to friends and colleagues. “It’s got zero to do with progressive social policies,” Mr. Palmisano added.Ms. Rometty has led the growth and development of I.B.M.’s huge services business for more than a decade. The services strategy, analysts say, is partly a marketing tactic. But, they add, it also represents a different approach to the technology business, with less emphasis on selling hardware and software products. Instead, I.B.M. puts together bundles of technology to help business streamline operations, find customers and develop new products.“I.B.M. is selling business solutions, not just products,” said Frank Gens, chief analyst for the technology market research firm IDC. “Rometty has been at the forefront of that effort.”Ms. Rometty, who graduated from Northwestern University with an undergraduate degree in computer science, joined I.B.M. in 1981 as a systems engineer. She quickly moved up to a series of management jobs, working with clients in industries including banking, insurance, telecommunications, manufacturing and health care.In 2002, Ms. Rometty championed the purchase of the big business consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting, for $3.5 billion.

The deal was made shortly after Mr. Palmisano became chief executive and it was seen as a big risk. The PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants were used to operating fairly independently, in a very different culture from the more regimented I.B.M. style of the time. The danger, analysts say, was that the business consultants would flee in droves, leaving the business a shell.Ms. Rometty was put in charge of coordinating the work of the acquired firm’s consultants with I.B.M.’s technologists, to tailor services and software offering for specific industries. Ms. Rometty, analysts say, worked tirelessly and effectively to win over the consultants. “She did the deal, and she made it work,” Mr. Palmisano said.

“Ginni Rometty combines performance and charisma,” said George F. Colony, chairman of Forrester Research. “She orchestrated a massive charm campaign to bring the PricewaterhouseCoopers people into the fold. That was the trial by fire for her.”In 2009, Ms. Rometty became senior vice president and group executive for sales, marketing and strategy. Part of the job is leading the I.B.M. drive to sharply increase its business in overseas growth markets, like China, India, Brazil and dozens of emerging markets, including several African nations. Such markets now account for 23 percent of I.B.M.’s revenue, up from 20 percent when she took over. It should reach 30 percent by 2015, the company projects.The top marketing job also includes spotting opportunities to use the science coming out of I.B.M.’s labs in new products and services. In that perch, Ms. Rometty has pushed to expand the company’s fast-growing analytics unit, which blends data-mining software with services expertise. “It’s not about capturing markets, it’s about making new markets,” Ms. Rometty said in a brief interview after the announcement.Mr. Palmisano succeeded Louis V. Gerstner Jr., an outsider who became chief executive in 1993, and led a historic turnaround of I.B.M., an endangered corporate icon. Mr. Palmisano inherited a company that had returned to health, but he set about transforming it once again. Under Mr. Palmisano, I.B.M. sold its personal computer and some other hardware lines, and focused increasingly on services and software. I.B.M. sells mainly to business and governments, leaving consumer technology to others.His strategy for driving the company behind big services projects to use technology to tackle big business and societal challenges, like energy, traffic and water management, had a catchy title, “Smarter Planet.” But such grand themes were initially met with skepticism on Wall Street. “The challenge is that you have to bring investors with you,” Mr. Palmisano explained.That led to the development of a “financial roadmap,” setting out five-year plans for its growth initiatives and profit targets for the company as a whole. This year, I.B.M. is completing the first five-year roadmap, with the numbers running ahead of the plan, despite the 2007-2009 recession.I.B.M.’s profits have increased sharply since Mr. Palmisano took over, and its stock price climbed. Earlier this year, I.B.M. passed Microsoft to become the second most valuable technology company, measured by market capitalization, trailing only Apple, the consumer technology powerhouse.I.B.M. must steadily evolve, Ms. Rometty said, but she does not anticipate changing course abruptly. “What you’ll see is an unfolding of the strategy we have in place,” Ms. Rometty said, noting that she had a hand in creating it.

International Business Machines Corp. is pivoting back to the consumer market it abandoned more than a decade ago when it spun off its PC business. The company aims to be a player in the emerging world of connected kitchen appliances and fitness monitors, among other products.
The plan is to use IBM’s artificial intelligence and data analytics technology to make such devices more useful, according to CEO Virginia “Ginni” Rometty. Ms. Rometty made her pitch on Wednesday to attendees at CES, the annual Las Vegas technology convention where many of these next-gen products were unveiled this week.

Virginia M. Rometty, newly named as chief of I.B.M., has a husband with the time and flexibility to support her career.

Here’s to Mark Rometty.Mr. Rometty is a principal investor in the Bam Oil Company, where he’s listed as treasurer and secretary and, when I called, answered the phone. He’s also married to Virginia Rometty, the new C.E.O.-designate and first woman tapped to head I.B.M., a company that not only ranks 18th in the Fortune 500, but stands as a symbol of American managerial prowess. Acquaintances say the intensely private Mr. Rometty deserves tremendous credit for pursuing a career that gave him the time and flexibility to support his wife’s ascension to the pinnacle of global business — as, for that matter, do the vast majority of C.E.O. spouses of both genders. Still, the C.E.O. husband remains a rarity in American business.When I reached Mr. Rometty this week at his Florida office, he was emphatic that this was a subject he didn’t want to discuss. Nor did Ms. Rometty, who was logging some of the millions of miles she travels every year visiting I.B.M. customers all over the globe.An I.B.M. spokesman said both were eager to preserve as much privacy as possible, and who can blame them? All he said was that both enjoyed scuba diving and Broadway plays and that they divided their time between homes in New York and Bonita Springs, Fla. They met when both were enrolled in the General Motors Institute embarking on business careers and have been married for 32 years.The Romettys aren’t the only couple reluctant to discuss the husband’s role in his wife’s success. There’s still a social stigma for the stay-at-home or less successful husband that women don’t face. And management experts say that that has to change if women are going to be represented in the top jobs at a level commensurate with their numbers and talent.

Asked at a Barnard College conference what men could do to help advance women’s leadership, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of the landmark “Men and Women of the Corporation,” answered, “The laundry.” Continue reading the main story

“Women are not going to say, ‘My husband is not as successful as he could have been because he’s been supporting me,’ ” Ms. Kanter told me this week. “It would be seen as putting him down. But when the shoe is on the other foot, men say, ‘She really helped me.’ People say, ‘Isn’t it wonderful that he has someone who allows him to focus on his work?’ This is culturally valued.”Statistics suggest that aspirants to America’s top corporate jobs had better have a spouse, partner or someone else willing to be devoted to the aspirant’s career. “How do you compete without a spouse? Basically, you can’t,” Richard Zweigenhaft said. Mr. Zweigenhaft is professor of psychology at Guilford College in North Carolina and the co-author (with G. William Domhoff) of “The New C.E.O.’s,” a study of women and minorities who are chief executives (Rowman & Littlefield, 2011).The overwhelming number of American C.E.O.’s of both genders are married, and most, like Ms. Rometty, have been for many years. Divorce at this level is comparatively rare. Mr. Zweigenhaft and Mr. Domhoff studied all 28 women who had held or currently hold the post of chief executive of a Fortune 500 company (Ms. Rometty will be No. 29). Twenty-six were married, one was divorced and only one had never married. “How many had house husbands? We don’t really know, but there are certainly some who fit that pattern,” Mr. Zweigenhaft said. “Many of the women C.E.O.’s said they could not have succeeded without the support of their husbands, helping with the children, the household chores, and showing a willingness to move.”Eighteen of the 28 women had children. While impressive, that’s a far lower rate than the 87 percent of married women in the population at large who have children of their own, according to Census data.Ms. Rometty and her husband have no children. Ms. Kanter said she didn’t want to comment specifically about Ms. Rometty, whom she knows, but said “whether to have kids is a major question couples have to face.” She added: “It’s been easier for male executives to feel great about having kids, because in the traditional division of labor, it’s the wives’ responsibility. We haven’t moved that far towards the idea that men should do the same.”

When he announced Ms. Rometty’s selection, I.B.M.’s chief executive, Sam Palmisano, told The Times that “Ginni got it because she deserved it. It’s got zero to do with progressive social policies.” He didn’t say anything about Mr. Rometty, but Ms. Rometty credits her husband with a crucial insight that helped shape her corporate ambitions.“Early in my career, I can remember being offered a big job,” she told a Fortune magazine conference on women and careers last month. “I right away said, ‘You know what? I’m not ready for this job. I need more time, I need more experience and then I could really do it well.’ And so I said to him, ‘I need to go home and think about it.’ ...— And my husband at the time, as usual, I’m blah-blah-blahing, and he’s just sitting there. And as I’m telling him about this, and I told him I would get back to them tomorrow. And he said to me, he looked at me, and he just looked at me and he said, ‘Do you think a man would have ever answered that question that way?’ And I sort of sat there — and it taught me a lesson. And he said, “I know you, you go do it, you’re going to — six months you’re going to be bored.’ ”Weren’t things supposed to be different? Wasn’t the rise of women in the workplace going to usher in a new era where two career couples would flourish side by side, sharing household and family duties and a more balanced life? “People used to say that men needed a wife at home and a wife at the office — the traditional secretary,” Ms. Kanter said. “Now women need the same thing: an assistant at work and a stay-at-home husband or at least a husband who’s very flexible and supportive. Anyone who hopes to be a corporate chief executive needs a big support system.”

There are prominent exceptions, and there are male C.E.O.’s who have wives with their own successful careers. Meg Whitman, newly installed as C.E.O. at Hewlett-Packard, is married to Griffith Harsh IV, a widely published and highly regarded neurosurgeon on the faculty at Stanford Medical School, who has pursued an obviously demanding and successful career. The couple raised two sons. Still, Dr. Harsh left the Harvard faculty and a prominent position at Massachusetts General Hospital to relocate to California when Ms. Whitman was named chief executive of eBay earlier in her career.Some of the women executives Mr. Zweigenhaft studied “are married to high-powered partners who are also C.E.O.’s or senior executives,” he said, such as Laura Sen (chief executive of BJ’s Wholesale Club), who was married to C. Michael Egan (chief of the biotech company Transmolecular until his death in 2009).There are very few true house husbands, men with no career outside the home. Nearly all husbands of chief executives have had some occupation, even if it is modest compared to their wives. Some husbands retire early. Frank Fiorina, who worked for many years at AT&T, took early retirement in 1998 to better support the career of his wife, Carly Fiorina, who became chief executive of Hewlett-Packard the next year and subsequently ran for the United States Senate. Ms. Fiorina had no children, but helped raise his two children from a previous marriage. And some C.E.O.’s find additional support from other family members. Ms. Rometty is described as especially close to her mother, whom she brought to this year’s I.B.M. centennial celebration.Among male chief executives, the supportive spouse still seems the norm.But there are some signs of change. Steve Tappin, author of “The Secrets of C.E.O.’s” (NB Publishing, 2008) and a management consultant with executive clients, said that top executives with high-powered spouses — or even no spouses — can now build “a great support system as long as they’re not financially constrained. They need life assistants and deep levels of support from friends and confidantes. It can even save them time not having to sustain a relationship.”But one thing that hasn’t changed is the all-out commitment to work and career needed from men and women who want to reach the top. “This is why so many women bail out,” Mr. Zweigenhaft said. “It’s not a life they want. But some do, and they’re finding the partners they need: men who are comfortable with the role of the supportive spouse.”Ms. Kanter said: “We’re at an odd inflection point. We’re still trying to figure out what it means for men and women to be peers, or to shift roles from time to time. Should one career come first? Couples are still struggling to work that out.”
