Science, Adventure, Education.

Daniel M Moore is a marine biologist and science communicator. His professional research interests are broad but include: spatial ecology of marine predators, population biology, connectivity in marine predator populations and chondrichthyan evolution. Daniel is a passionate conservationist and has worked in many remote locations around the world from isolated tropical volcanic islands to sub-arctic shorelines. When not pursuing his scientific interests he can usually be found seeking adventure in the mountains or on the ocean waves.
Daniel regularly works with businesses, NGOs and schools as a marine consultant and a passionate advocate for marine conservation. Daniel is an accomplished public speaker and writer. If you are interested in booking Daniel for an event or are keen to work with him as a consultant then you can contact him here.
He is currently conducting PhD research at Durham University investigating how oceanographic and environmental boundaries can influence the population structure of marine predator populations. This research  uses the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus and the yellowmouth barracuda Sphyraena viridensis as model species and examines their population structure across multiple front systems in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.
This site was started as a location to disseminate scientific research as well as being a place to inspire an interest in science, adventure, conservation and travel. Please follow the twitter feed to keep up to date with Daniel’s latest research and adventures.
          Observing wildlife is a key passion for Daniel, such as these Rough-Toothed Dolphins spotted on a research expedition in the mid-Atlantic.          Many animals can be individually identified by markings or patterns, including whales and dolphins. Getting a good photograph however takes some skill.          A love for exploring drives Daniel to travel. This photo was taken during sunrise at Angkor Wat, Cambodia.          Marine Biology can take you to some interesting and beautiful locations. This is St. Kilda, a remote archipelago of the UK.             Daniel has spent significant time at sea, exploring some wild and remote locations.          Daniel recently participated in the Antarctic Circumpolar Expedition (ACE).          Sunrise above the clouds. In his spare time Daniel is a keen mountaineer.          First inspired to study the sea by palaeobiology this remains one of Daniel’s interests to date. This fossilized tooth comes from Carcharocles megalodon and remains in Daniel’s personal collection.          Daniel is a passionate believer in the sustainable use of the sea by all. Finding opportunities for industry, recreation and conservation to work in harmony is a key part of his ethos.             Placing a temperature logger into the nest of a Green Turtle. Daniel has worked with a great variety of marine animals.          Daniel has worked with deep sea sharks extensively such as this specimen collected in the North Atlantic.          The coasts of Britain still harbour some of Daniel’s favourite wild places.

            Loved the Breaking Free study by Beth Moore; it was my first Moore study.  Daniel meets and exceeds my expectations.  Moore has done a wonderful job to incorporate prophecy with life application principles and scripture to support all of it.  She, in her forthright style, is wonderfully transparent in the DVD portion, is factual and real.  The product itself is of good quality, well though out, well laid out. It is a perfect once-a-week study for small groups who desire to improve their knowledge of prophecy and to truly repent, be transformed and draw closer to Him.

            We are doing this study as a group it is so exciting to dig deeper into to Gods  Word. The book by Beth Moore makes digging out facts that I didn't understand in reading through the Bible fun and exciting. I am really enjoying getting together once a week to watch the video and then dig into Gods word for five days and really study the fascinating  facts.

            this is the 2nd Beth Moore Study I have done with my ladies group and they are all so excited to come each week and they are all completing their homework each week. I will do another one when this is over, I only wish they went on sale so the pricing was a little better.

            This study has been one of the best, if not the best, Bible Study book I have ever worked through. It is full of depth and reveals more about Scripture and God's breathed words than many other studies I have done. I would highly recommend this study to all women's Bible study groups.

Daniel: Lives of Integrity, Words of Prophecy - Video Sessions (for individual viewing) are 12 individual, downloadable sessions from the women's Bible study by Beth Moore. This 12-session Bible study falls in two parts. The first portion, from Daniel chapters 1-6, deals with Daniel's life as he faced the kind of pressures and temptations Christians encounter today. Daniel models how to develop enduring integrity in an enticing world. The second portion, chapters 7-12, explores thrilling prophecies from the time of Daniel through the second coming of Jesus Christ. Session 1: Choices to Make, Beth discusses how surrounded by our own Babylon, modern believers face a choice. Will we influence or be influenced by it? (65:00) Session 2: A Dream and a Kingdom, Beth discusses some of the parallels between ancient Babylon and the western culture that seeks to hold us captive. (57:00) Session 3: No Smell of Fire, Beth discusses how just as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were called on to take a stand for God, a time comes for each believer to step up. (66:00) Session 4: Farewell Lessons from Nebuchadnezzar, Beth shows us how the example of God's disciplining King Nebuchadnezzar teaches us lessons. (60:00) Session 5: Beth discusses that vessels can be consecrated or set aside as holy for God's use. We, too, are holy vessels in the house of the Lord. (55:00) Session 6: In the Lions' Den, Beth discusses that in an emergency we can either panic, become paralyzed, or pray. (60:00) Session 7: The Ancient of Days, Beth looks at the dream in Daniel 7:1-14 that involves Daniel, the little horn, the Ancient of Days, and one like the son of man. (58:00) Session 8: Foreshadowing the Little Horn, Beth shows how the prophecy in Daniel chapter 8 includes both what is now past history and Israel's future experiences under Antichrist. (58:00) Session 9: Unexpected Answers to Prayer, Beth discusses that every covenant promise that God has made to Israel will find its full completion in the six-stage fulfillment in Daniel 9—to to bring the rebellion to an end, to put a stop to sin, to wipe away injustice, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy place. (62:00) Session 10: Speechless, Beth shows how God allowed His messenger to Daniel to be detained for 21 days because He was allowing the drama to play itself out. God is always the One fighting the battle, but sometimes He chooses to do it through believers. (60:00) Session 11: Kings in Succession, Beth discusses Daniel's reference to an evil ruler that causes the ceasing of the daily sacrifice. In today's terms, the New Testament calls for a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1). In this study Beth shares that we must be adamant about not being corrupted by the Babylon kind of culture that surrounds us, but rather, we must learn how to serve and how to pour out our lives out there without being corrupted by it. (60:00) Session 12: Go Your Way, Beth concludes the study in the last chapter of the Book of Daniel. God's final assurances to Daniel are fitting assurances to us as well. (62:00)

(58:00) Session 9: Unexpected Answers to Prayer, Beth discusses that every covenant promise that God has made to Israel will find its full completion in the six-stage fulfillment in Daniel 9—to to bring the rebellion to an end, to put a stop to sin, to wipe away injustice, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy place. (62:00) Session 10: Speechless, Beth shows how God allowed His messenger to Daniel to be detained for 21 days because He was allowing the drama to play itself out. God is always the One fighting the battle, but sometimes He chooses to do it through believers. (60:00) Session 11: Kings in Succession, Beth discusses Daniel's reference to an evil ruler that causes the ceasing of the daily sacrifice. In today's terms, the New Testament calls for a living sacrifice (Romans 12:1). In this study Beth shares that we must be adamant about not being corrupted by the Babylon kind of culture that surrounds us, but rather, we must learn how to serve and how to pour out our lives out there without being corrupted by it. (60:00) Session 12: Go Your Way, Beth concludes the study in the last chapter of the Book of Daniel. God's final assurances to Daniel are fitting assurances to us as well. (62:00)

Daniel: Lives of Integrity, Words of Prophecy - Video Sessions (for individual viewing) are 12 individual, downloadable sessions from the women's Bible study by Beth Moore. This 12-session Bible study falls in two parts. The first portion, from Daniel chapters 1-6, deals with Daniel's life as he faced the kind of pressures and temptations Christians encounter today. Daniel models how to develop enduring integrity in an enticing world. The second portion, chapters 7-12, explores thrilling prophecies from the time of Daniel through the second coming of Jesus Christ. Session 1: Choices to Make, Beth discusses how surrounded by our own Babylon, modern believers face a choice. Will we influence or be influenced by it? (65:00) Session 2: A Dream and a Kingdom, Beth discusses some of the parallels between ancient Babylon and the western culture that seeks to hold us captive. (57:00) Session 3: No Smell of Fire, Beth discusses how just as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were called on to take a stand for God, a time comes for each believer to step up. (66:00) Session 4: Farewell Lessons from Nebuchadnezzar, Beth shows us how the example of God's disciplining King Nebuchadnezzar teaches us lessons. (60:00) Session 5: Beth discusses that vessels can be consecrated or set aside as holy for God's use. We, too, are holy vessels in the house of the Lord. (55:00) Session 6: In the Lions' Den, Beth discusses that in an emergency we can either panic, become paralyzed, or pray. (60:00) Session 7: The Ancient of Days, Beth looks at the dream in Daniel 7:1-14 that involves Daniel, the little horn, the Ancient of Days, and one like the son of man.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Daniel: Lives of Integrity, Words of Prophecy - Leader Kit by Beth Moore helps a leader facilitate this women's Bible study of Daniel and contains all that is needed to conduct the 12 weeks of small group time. Join Beth in a faith-building study of prophecy and learn how to live with integrity in today's self-absorbed society. The prophet Daniel faced unbelievable pressures to compromise his faith, to live in a hostile culture, and to confront temptations and threats. Today, believers in Jesus Christ face many of the same trials.This Old Testament Bible study falls in two parts and can be used as one (12 session) study or two separate (6 session) studies. The first portion, from Daniel chapters 1-6, deals with Daniel's life as he faced the kind of pressures and temptations Christians encounter today. Daniel models how to develop enduring integrity in an enticing world. The second portion, chapters 7-12, explores thrilling prophecies from the time of Daniel through the second coming of Jesus Christ.The Leader Kit includes:6 DVDs (12 teaching segments)1 Member Book1 Leader GuideDVD promo videoContains subtitles for the hearing impaired

            This is my second time doing the Daniel study. I am always challenged in new ways and areas of my life. I find new truths I missed the first time and am amazed at how much I never retained. I love Beth's workbook and she makes it so much easier to understand.

Product DescriptionExplore Beth Moore's newest study, the Book of Daniel! 
Divided into 2 parts, the 1st portion (Daniel 1-6), emphasized by Lives of Integrity, deals with the life of the prophet and is extremely contemporary. Daniel faced pressures and temptations similar to those of a Christian in today's world. He teaches and models for us how to develop enduring integrity in an enticing world.
The 2nd half (Daniel 7-12), turns to explore the prophecies of Daniel. It deals in-depth with the historical details, predictions, and fulfillments detailing history from the time of Daniel, through the inter-biblical period, the time of Christ, and on to the second coming of Christ.
This member book is part of a 12-session in-depth Bible study that examines both the life of the prophet Daniel and the prophetic teachings of the book.More Product InformationPublisher: Lifeway Christian Resources

Series Name: Beth Moore Daniel
About the AuthorBeth MooreBeth Moore was born on an Army base in Green Bay, Wisconsin, during what her father describes as the worst thunderstorm the city had seen in five years. He affectionately says the Lord brought her into the world with a drum roll. The fourth child of a retired Army major and a homemaker, Beth was raised in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. Her father managed the local cinema where each of her four siblings had a role to play. Beth’s job was to hand out samples of popcorn and soda. Growing up in the theater had its perks. Sometimes Beth would be allowed to slip into a movie and take with her a pickle bag full of popcorn and a Dixie cup of Coke.  There in a theater chair, wide-eyed and filled to the brim with Coca-Cola, Beth began a lifelong love for stories. She loved to tell them, write them, and be told them. The story that captured her heart and consumed her life, however, was not told in a movie theater. It was the story told in Sunday School of Jesus, a Savior who loved children and who thought she was special. A seed was planted in her young heart that would grow to mark her life with a passionate love for Christ.  At the age of 18, Beth sensed God calling her to work for Him. Although she couldn’t imagine what that would mean, she made it her goal to say yes to whatever He asked. Beth graduated from Southwest Texas State University with a degree in political science. She would later receive an honorary doctorate in humanities from Howard Payne University. She married Keith in 1978 and soon after the Lord added Amanda and Melissa to the family. As a young wife and mother, Beth served the Lord by speaking at luncheons and retreats, working at Mother’s Day Out, and teaching Christian aerobics.  A love for the Word of God was embedded in Beth’s life when she took a Bible doctrine class at her church. Her teacher was Buddy Walters, a former college football player who taught the Scriptures with tears streaming down his cheeks. She fervently prayed for such a passion for God’s Word. It was Buddy who first taught Beth, along with Keith, how to study the Bible.  Beth founded Living Proof Ministries in 1994 with the purpose of teaching women how to love and live on God’s Word. She has written numerous books and Bible studies, including Breaking Free, Believing God, and When Godly People Do Ungodly Things, that have been read by women of all ages, races, and denominations. Through the years, American missionaries and expatriates have taken the Bible studies overseas, resulting in Beth Moore Bible study groups popping up all over the world. Beth’s Living Proof Live conferences have taken her to thirty-nine states since 1994 and have been attended by more than 421,000 women. God has graciously given her the opportunity to speak to the body of Christ in many different countries, including Ireland, England, Singapore, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and India. With great joy, she began a radio ministry in 2004 called Living Proof with Beth Moore. Ever the storyteller, Beth is known to pepper her teaching with stories and poems written from the perspective of pertinent characters. She communicates with great energy, passion, humor, warmth, and grace.  Beth remains very dedicated to her home fellowship, Houston’s First Baptist Church, where she teaches a 700-member Sunday School class. There she hosts an interdenominational Tuesday-night Bible study for women in her city. Because of her burden for unity in the body of Christ, Beth counts serving women of all denominations as one of her greatest privileges in life.  Keith and Beth have been married over twenty-six years. They enjoy traveling, sipping coffee on the back porch, eating Mexican food together, and making each other laugh. The Moores live in Houston, Texas, with their two dogs, Beanie and Sunny.Related ProductsAdd to CartDaniel Leader Guide: Lives of Integrity,Moore, Beth Only $10.73Add to CartDaniel Audio CD's:  Lives of Integrity,Moore, Beth Only $55.75Add to CartWhispers of Hope: 10 Weeks of DevotionalMoore, Beth Only $13.19 Reg. $14.99Add to CartThe Undoing of Saint SilvanusMoore, Beth Only $21.99 Reg. $24.99Add to CartThe Promise of Security (Booklet)Moore, Beth Only $2.09Add to CartSo Long, Insecurity Teen EditionMoore, Beth Only $13.19 Reg. $14.99Add to CartPraying God's Word: Breaking Free fromMoore, Beth Only $13.19 Reg. $14.99Add to CartGet Out of That Pit: Straight Talk aboutMoore, Beth Only $14.95 Reg. $16.99Add to CartEntrusted Bible Study Book: A Study of 2Moore, Beth Only $18.25Add to CartBreaking Free Member Book: MakingMoore, Beth Only $22.25Add to CartJames Member Book: Mercy TriumphsMoore, Beth Only $22.25Add to CartEsther Member Book: It's Tough Being aMoore, Beth Only $22.25Add to CartPraying God's Word Day by DayMoore, Beth Only $14.07 Reg. $15.99Add to CartBreaking Free: Discover the Victory ofMoore, Beth Only $13.19 Reg. $14.99Add to CartLooking Up: Trusting God with Your EveryMoore, Beth Only $14.95 Reg. $16.99Add to CartPraying God's Word: Breaking Free fromMoore, Beth Only $8.79 Reg. $9.99
