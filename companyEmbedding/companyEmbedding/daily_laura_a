Product Review: Skinfood Daily Routine

November 5, 2013




I was super lucky to be sent the Skinfood skin care range to test, try and review! Being a fan of natural and New Zealand made, I was super excited to get my hands on anything Skinfood â€“ with huge expectations from myself (and husband), we were pleasantly surprised!
My Skinfood Routines
Morning
In the shower I use the Cleans All, Exfoliating Scrub. When I jump out of the shower I pop on a layer of the light moisturiser (Nourishing Moisturiser).
This routine leaves my skin nourished, smooth, and noticeablyÂ fresh looking and clean. Oily problem areas have cleaned up, and dry areas are gone! Putting on the cleanser, it feels as though iâ€™m putting what only can be described as â€˜thick waterâ€™ â€“ haha, it sounds strange, but honestly thats what it feels like. Super smooth and just -oh!- so good!
Nighttime
Light moisturiser after removing all makeup. * I put quite a bit on as in my head nighttime is the perfect time for my skin to absorb moisturisers, sort of like giving myself a facial (yeah? nah? maybe?)
* Iâ€™ve used the cleanser as a eyeÂ makeupÂ remover a few times, and it was actually pretty great at removing mascara. Pop a small amount on a tissue and use your fingers to gently rub the makeup off, itâ€™s strong enough to get of tough mascara (gel mascaras) but soft enough not to hurt your delicate eye areas.
Other / Daily / When I think about it
When body butter made its debut all those years ago, I gave it a go and decided I actually hated it. Most of the brands that brought them out had amazing strong smelling tubs of the stuff, but left my skin, and hands, with a wet-not-absorbed feel, almost oily. Ew.
I decided to give the Skinfood body butter a shot though, it smelt really delicate and when I tried a small amount on my arms, I was happy with how it actually absorbed into my skin quickly. Honestly, I cannot live without this body butter.Â Itâ€™s so freakinâ€™ amazing! My legs used to have noticeably dry areas, especially at the front, this little tub got right in there and cleared it up and left the rest of my body feeling amazing. You need it in your life.

Skinfood had a â€˜new look revealâ€™ last week with amazing new branding and new products (their body bars sound amazing!) Libby from Julia&Libby went along and spoke â€“ Check out their facebook post here to find out more about the new look reveal!
Where to buy?
All good supermarkets and The Warehouse nationwide. The range goes from Lip Balms to Face Masks to Shaving Gel to Body Butters and everything in between.

I have the cleanser but havenâ€™t tried it yet! I am always cautious with new skin care products but I like the sound of a lot of these products.

Hour 2: Angie's husband has health issues, which is bringing her down in life. How can Angie be positive for her husband's sake and live a happy life rather than getting bogged down with her husband's health problems?

Hour 3: Kristen's mom has dementia and is now faced with news that her aunt is dying. Should she reveal her aunt's condition to her mom or not burden her with this hard news?

10 Products To Use Daily (Laura's Favourite Things!)









It's amazing all the STUFF we use on any given day.

Nail files, pasta spoons, band-aids, sun hats, candles... ok that's a weird list but you get the idea!

Ultimately though, you gravitate towards certain items, things you just couldn't do without on a day to day basis.

Today I want to talk to you about the top 10 items in my life that I use every. single. day. The things that make my life better, easier or just plain happier. Kind of like "Oprah's Favourite Things" except I can't afford to give anyone a car...


I'm not including my phone, tablet or laptop on this list. I'm sure you all understand the extreme need for these things in daily life. This top 10 will focus on beauty products, organizational products and lifestyle products that I couldn't do without.

And here they are...

1) Aveeno Suncare Products






I'm a big Aveeno girl. The exfoliant, the daily moisturizer and the toner are part of my daily routine. But the two products I value at the top of the list? The "Clear Complexion BB Cream" with SPF 30 for your face, and the "Daily Moisturizing Lotion" for your body with SPF 15.

I can't stress this enough people: daily sunscreen application. Even when it's cloudy, or winter, or raining cats and dogs. I apply the BB cream to my face (it has a nice tint to even out my complexion!) and the Daily Moisturizing lotion to my chest, arms and shoulders to keep me covered.

Let's keep wrinkles at bay!


2) Smashbox Blendable Colour Stick







This little beauty has been my go to makeup trick for the past 6 months. The LA Lights Blendable Lip and Cheek Colour from Smashbox Cosmetics in "Canyon Coral" was the perfect summer colour for my cheekbones (or the added lip touch up).

I'm going to switch it to the more rosy "Echo Park Pink" for fall and winter.

It glides on smooth, blends great, lasts all day long and lasts FOREVER because you really only need a dab to put colour into your cheeks.

It also comes with a blender at the end of the stick for on the go touch ups to your cheeks and lips when you don't have a beauty sponge with you. Convenient!


3) ban.do Planner

I live and die by the planner. As an aggressively type-A individual who likes to micromanage in the extreme and plans my time out weeks in advance, having a good planner is aÂ necessity.






I've gone through many iterations, but my newest one is an 17 month beauty, with stickers, inspirational notes, and good amounts of space for monthly or daily planning. I actually wrote a blog post on this planner when I got it because I was so excited, and I stand by it!

I'll be needing a new one soon, and will definitely be getting the same one.


4) David's Tea Infuser Mug (And Earl Grey Loose Leaf)

I am a tea fanatic. I start every day with a cup of Earl Grey, made in my Tea Mug with Infuser from David's Teas.






Because I'll sometimes drink between three to four cups of tea a day. I was going through a TON of tea bags before I bought this mug. It's now one of my favourite things.Â 


5) Kate Spade Wristlet

A few years ago for my Birthday, Kris bought me a gorgeous Kate Spade wristlet.

Actually he's bought me a bunch of great Kate Spade stuff (obsessed with the brand) but the wristlet is my favourite.






The perfect size to slide in my iPad mini, phone, lip gloss, hair ties, small note pad, pen and money pouch (I don't carry a wallet) it has everything I could possibly need in it at all times.Â 

It's brilliant, I either loop it around my wrist when I'm running errands, or transfer it from bag to bag so that I always have my essentials grouped together and easy to find in the depths of whatever bag I happen to be carrying that day.Â 

Unfortunately after two years of daily use it's starting to show it's age, but I have my eye on this cute replacement!


6) E-Reader

I was a late convert to the e-reader club, but I am on board now! I have a pretty extensive book collection and no where to put it, so buying MORE books is becoming less of an option.

Plus when it comes to travel or commuting, e-readers are SO easy to carry!

If I download a book and love it, I'll still buy a hard copy; but it's nice to know that I have some solid literature at my finger tips on the go!


7) Chanel Shades

I don't want to alarm anyone... but my Chanel Shades are magic.

Seriously, I was visiting New York in the spring, my FIRST visit. I'd just been dumped, was horribly depressed, and decided to spend some of the "down payment" money on a NYC shopping trip.

The trouble was it was raining. I mean could it GET any worse?

We went straight to the Chanel store in Soho and I bought the sunglasses I'd been coveting for months... and when I walked out, sunshine. FOR 5 STRAIGHT DAYS!

They've been my good luck shades ever since. It helps that they are beautiful!Â 


8) Blogging Bullet Journal

I have a bit of a notebook habit. Aside from my planner, I have a small flip book I keep in my wristlet (see above!) as well as a travel journal for when I'm flitting about on adventures.Â 

But a blogger needs a dedicated notebook!Â 

I keep mine in an easy bullet journal style and make notes on everything from recipes, to reattempted recipes, to blog post planning, to stray thoughts, to webinar notes.

The whole of Cook, Wine and Thinker is messily written within it's pages. I bring it just about everywhere!


9) Yoga Shoes

One of my latest obsessions? My Sanuk Shoes.






As anyone who spends a lot of time standing on kitchen tiles can tell you, it's hard on the feet. These fab shoes are made from recycled yoga mats, they just ABSORB your foot and are so cozy.

Which is great for when I'm trying a new recipe... or retrying it... or perfecting it for the blog!


10) Sippy Cup

Last but not least, I want to talk to you about my adult sippy cup.

I don't know how this started, but in the early days of our relationship Kris and I moved to drinking water out of sippy cups. It's actually a great way to drink water because you tend to drink it faster through the straw so you can ACTUALLY get your 8 cups a day.

Hydration is important folks!







Plus if you accidentally knock it off your nightstand it doesn't spill everywhere and ruin your phone.

We still have nice glasses for when guests arrive, but if you catch us relaxing around the house, you better believe we both have a sippy cup near by!


What are the products you couldn't do without on a day to day basis?Â 

Do they match any of mine or do you have your own top 10 favourites? I'd love if you would leave me a comment below!

I recently rediscovered this and I still feel that it is one of the very best sunscreens for sensitive skin.  I can't wear avobenzone at all.  I had an awful reaction to one of the new ones La Roche Posay was hyping.  I find their Athelios line to be highly irritating and burning.  So no chemical sunscreens for me, sorry.  I can only use mineral-based SPF.  Also, I love Laura Mercier's Daily Face Shield as an alternative to Laura Mercier's Tinted Moisturizer because it has no added color (so you can apply any foundation you like over it), you double the SPF rating, and the finish is better for combination skin.PROS:Titanium dioxide sunscreen is broad spectrum and suitable for sensitive skinDoes not appear chalkyAlthough you can feel it initially it dries to a weightless feel and can be worn under foundationNot too heavy or creamy making it ideal for combination to oily skinSkin feels soft and silkyCONS:It's not ideal for oily skin. $45 for an ounce is very expensive.You have to remember to shake the bottle before dispensing it.SUMMARY: I really love this sunscreen and was able to use it even when I was having contact dermatitis, redness and swelling.  It seemed to calm my skin rather than aggravate it.I don't mind that it's a little runny - I think the thinness of it is what keeps it from feeling thick or heavy.If you have very dry skin you may have to use another moisturizer with it because it isn't thick and creamy.If you have very oily skin there is always a slight risk that mineral sunscreens can contribute to breakouts.  (If the finish of this one is not matte enough for you, SkinCeuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense 50 has a drier finish, but it is tinted and the tint may be too dark if you have fair skin.)

My main niggle is the price, it's expensive for an ounce of sunscreen. I go through sunscreen (and this one in particular as it's so light and slippy) like gangbusters so if I bought this again it would be a spendy treat. Mercier products are pricey and usually you're getting quality for your money. This is quality, but for the price I really want SPF50 or above for a high end, high price sunscreen, and at SPF40 this comes in a little low for my liking. I also wish it lasted longer. I'm still on the hunt for that perfect sunscreen.As I say it's light and slippy and I worried that I wasn't getting enough coverage to properly protect me, however it does seem to have stable and efficient sun protection despite it's lightness of feel. It's oil-free but it is siliconey, so I can see this either not being a good idea for oily skin or perhaps interfering with your preferred skincare/makeup routine. I enjoyed it's light feel under makeup and the silicone helps makeup glide on smoothly with none of the heavy stickiness of many sunscreens. Another plus is that it leaves no white cast and doesn't look like you have sunscreen on. It's good for sensitive skin. I just seemed to use this up very quickly so it's a bit too pricey to be my everyday sunscreen, but I would repurchase, it's certainly a reliable option.

For that reason, HE sunscreens like this are a good investment because I don't break out and they don't run out quickly. I first tried this a few years ago in a promotional sample kit with the coconut scrub and eye serum. Would gladly have purchased full sizes of any of them but the flawless face shield won me over hands down. The sample alone lasted for weeks, and I was using it everyday. The liquid is kind of sparkly and opalescent, smells expensive, and absorbs super fast. You only need a fine layer and you're protected ... Totally worth going for the 1 oz! Gotta love Laura Mercier face products; I seriously have yet to be disappointed.

The LM is greasier, takes longer to "set" to matte, gets greasier as it wears, so makeup disappears, and it also gets "sandy" feeling if you sweat. Check my review of the Antehelios - it wears sooooo much better under makeup, almost like a primer! Colors stay true, my makeup stays on. And it's cheaper, with a higher SPF. So I won't be buying the Laura Mercier again, too expensive for what it is.

Until I met this product.  This is the only sunscreen I am able to wear with foundation or TM (make sure the  sunscreen in the TM or foundation you use doesn't make this unstable).  It works as a great primer and doesn't bead or splotch even in hot weather. I wear on my chest as well if my shirt is cut low, and I haven't had any breakouts down there.  I have dry skin and it is a little drying on the coldest days of winter, but the rest of the time it is fine.  I am in love.

I was told that this is a day cream with sunscreen. I noticed that my skin still felt a little dry after I put it on. When I read the packaging carefully, it said that this be applied OVER moisturizer. I am not paying $45 for sunscreen only when I can get a combination day cream with SPF. I was misled by the saleswoman, which is disappointing.

It doesn't cause ANY type of irritation, breakouts, or greasy oil slick. It works as both a light moisturizer and primer. It helps my foundation go on even more smoothly and last longer. I think it is slightly water resistance because even when I perspire I don't find that it breaks down. Also, no white cast :)It is a very runny liquid. The best way to spread this without using half the bottle is to make sure your face is slightly damp. I spritz water lightly on right before and it works great that way. I dab it on forehead, cheeks, chin and spread then go back and do around the eyes with a teeny bit more. Sinks in quickly. Pricey, but def HG for me.

It is a runny consistency but leaves the skin feeling silky smooth.  A little goes a long way.  It is awesome under makeup and can be used instead of a primer.  It's oil controlling and supposedly helps your skin adjust to extreme climates.  I like that it is SPF 40 and feel extremely lightweight.  Definitely recommend.
