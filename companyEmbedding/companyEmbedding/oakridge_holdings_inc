	BUSINESS



	 




	GENERAL




	 


	Oakridge Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary, collectively, are called the “Company” or “Oakridge,” and all references to “our,” “us” and “we” refer to Oakridge Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires.  The Company has one business segment — aviation ground support equipment.


	The Company was incorporated as a Minnesota corporation in 1961 and began operations on March 6, 1961, with two cemeteries in Cook County, Illinois, selling cemetery property, merchandise and service. 


	On June 29, 1998, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Stinar Corporation, a Minnesota corporation.  Stinar Corporation has been in business for 68 years and is an established international manufacturer, and its products are used by the airline support equipment industry.  


	Stinar is a global manufacturer of ground support equipment for the aviation industry which is used for servicing, loading, and maintaining all types of aircraft for both commercial and government aviation companies and airports.  These products are sold and marketed through our technically oriented sales staff as well as through independent distributors and sales representatives.  Approximately 7% of Stinar’s revenues in the year ended June 30, 2016 were generated by contracts with the U.S. Government, 1% were generated internationally and 92% were generated in the United States from non-governmental sales.  In year ended June 30, 2015 approximately 18% of Stinar’s revenues were generated by contracts with the U.S. Government, 8% were generated internationally and 74% were generated in the United States from non-governmental sales. 


	On June 20, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase with Kruckeberg Industries, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.  Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company and Stinar agreed to sell to Purchaser substantially all of the assets owned by Stinar including the premises located at 3255 Sibley Memorial Highway, Eagan, Minnesota 55121, used in the operation of the Business, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $300,000 in cash, subject to upward or downward adjustment based on the current liabilities to be purchased and assumed by Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement.  


	All references to years are to fiscal years ended June 30, unless otherwise stated.


	 




	STINAR CORPORATION OVERVIEW




	 


	Stinar provides products and services to the aviation industry in three principal areas:  (i) sales of new equipment manufactured for maintaining, servicing and loading of airplanes; (ii) sales of parts for equipment sold in the past; and (iii) repair of equipment.


	Principal products of Stinar include the following:  


	Truck-mounted stairways and push stairs for loading aircraft; lavatory trucks and carts, water trucks, bobtails, and catering trucks for servicing aircraft; cabin cleaning trucks, maintenance hi-lifts, and turbo oilers for maintaining aircraft; and other custom built aviation ground support equipment used by airports, airlines and the military.  Stinar also provides service and repairs on other vendors’ equipment and equipment it has sold.


	The Company purchases carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum and chassis domestically.  We do not use single-source suppliers for the majority of our raw material purchases and believe supplies of raw material available in the market are adequate to meet our needs. 


	We historically have engaged in research and development activities directed primarily toward the improvement of existing products, the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs, and the development of new products and processes.  A large part of our product development spending in the past has focused on the new product lines in the stairs department.


	 



	AVIATION GROUND SUPPORT INDUSTRY



	 


	GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.  Contracts with the U.S. government are subject to special laws and regulations, noncompliance with which could result in various sanctions.


	The aviation ground support industry internationally is characterized by the following fundamental attributes:


	HIGHLY FRAGMENTED OWNERSHIP.  A significant majority of aviation ground support equipment manufacturers consist of family-owned businesses.  Management estimates that there are approximately 20 companies in the world that manufacture one or two products for the industry.  Also, as a support industry, ground support equipment has few market drivers of its own.  That is, the major determinants of ground support equipment market activity are to be found in the commercial aviation industry.  Under these conditions, many suppliers have in-depth knowledge only of their own market niches, and end-users may have difficulty finding a supplier with the right mix of products and services to fit their needs.


	SIZE AND GROWTH TRENDS.  The aviation ground support industry appears to be taking on the characteristics of a shrinking and declining industry over the next couple of years.  Given the weakness of the four main indicators (aircraft movements, aircraft delivery rates, price of fuel and airport construction/capacity improvement) of the industry’s health, as well as the continuing decline in markets for import and export, the world market for purchases of new aviation ground support equipment is expected to decline drastically due to most airlines downsizing operations and many large domestic carriers having filed for bankruptcy protection over the last several years.


	BARRIERS TO ENTRY.  It is relatively difficult for new competitors to enter the field due to (i) high start-up costs, which effectively protect against small competitors entering the field, (ii) substantial expertise required with regard to manufacturing and engineering difficulties, which makes it difficult to have the knowledge to compete, and (iii) market saturation, which reduces the possibility of competitors gaining a meaningful foothold and network of manufacturing representatives.  Moreover, airline companies are becoming increasingly selective about which companies they will allow to provide ground support equipment.  Most airlines only purchase from vendors who have a history in the industry.

	REGULATIONS




	 


	Stinar is required to comply with competitive bidding and other requirements in cases where it sells to local, state, or federal governmental customers. The costs and effects of complying with these requirements do not have a material impact on the financial results of the Company.


	The Company holds all governmental licenses necessary to carry on its business, and all such licenses are current.  The company is subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes.  The OSHA hazard communication standard, the Unites States Environmental Protection Agency community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, and similar state statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.  Certain portions of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and local citizens. 


	 




	COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS




	 


	Stinar owns a 43,271 square foot manufacturing facility located on approximately 7.875 acres of land (the “Stinar Facility”) in an industrial park in Eagan, Minnesota, a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota.  Prior to the acquisition of the Stinar Facility in 1998, Stinar and the Company obtained a Phase I environmental assessment of the Stinar Facility.  This Phase I environmental assessment suggested the need for additional study of the Stinar Facility.  In addition, the Phase I assessment suggested that certain structural improvements be made to the Stinar Facility.  Accordingly, two additional Phase II environmental assessments were performed and revealed the presence of certain contaminants in the soil around and under the building located on the Stinar facility.


	Subsequent to the completion of the Phase II environmental assessments and completion of the structural improvements to the building, the Company and Stinar requested and obtained a "no association" letter from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency ("MPCA") stating that, provided that certain conditions set forth in the no association letter are met, the Company and Stinar will not be deemed responsible for contamination that occurred at the Stinar Facility prior to the purchase of the assets of Stinar by the Company. The structural improvements recommended by the Company's environmental consulting firm have been completed, and the contaminated soil has been removed and transferred from the property. As a result, MPCA issued the no association letter.


	As requested by Kruckeberg Industries, LLC, from January 2016 to March 2016, Landmark Environmental, LLC conducted a Phase I Environmental test and a Supplemental Phase II Environmental test and revealed that areas of buried debris and impacted soils should be excavated and transported off-site for disposal to allow for future redevelopment of the Property. The quote for excavation is around $76,000. The Company is planning to do the excavation in 2017.


	 




	COMPETITION




	 


	Factors determining competitive success in Stinar aviation manufacturing include price, service, location, quality and technological innovation.  Competition is strong in all markets served.


	The aviation ground support equipment business is extremely fragmented and diverse.  The purchasers of the types of equipment manufactured by Stinar tend to be long-standing, repeat customers of the same manufacturers, with quality, reliability, pricing, warranties, after market service and delivery being the key factors cited by customers in selecting an aviation ground support equipment supplier.  Accordingly, while the market for Stinar equipment is competitive, the Company believes that Stinar’s reputation for quality and reliable equipment and the industry’s familiarity with Stinar puts it on equal footing with its competitors.  Major domestic competitors include Global Ground Support, LLC in catering equipment; Lift-A-Loft Corporation and NMC-Wollard in passenger stairs; Lift-A-Loft Corporation, NMC-Wollard and Phoenix Metal Products in lavatory and water carts; and Tesco Equipment Corporation, Lift-A-Loft corporation, Phoenix Metal Products and NMC-Wollard in hi-lift equipment.  International competitors include Mullaghan Engineering and TLD, Inc. in catering equipment and stairs, and Accessair Systems, Inc. and Vestergaard Company, Inc. in water and lavatory carts.


	 




	MARKETING




	 


	The chief method of marketing Stinar’s equipment is through one-on-one customer contact made by sales employees of Stinar and manufacturers’ representatives under contract with Stinar.  Stinar’s customers report that Stinar has a reputation in the commercial aviation industry for manufacturing high-quality, reliable equipment.  Stinar intends to capitalize on this reputation in the domestic airline industry by reducing the amount of time needed to complete customer orders.  Stinar has also engaged manufacturers’ representatives to assist it in increasing sales to overseas markets.


	 




	CREDIT POLICIES




	 


	Stinar does not extend long-term credit to customers.    


	 




	INTERNATIONAL




	 


	Stinar’s sales to customers outside the United States represented approximately 1% and 8% of Stinar’s net sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Products are manufactured and marketed through the Company’s sales department and sales representatives around the world.  


	 




	OTHER BUSINESS INFLUENCES




	 


	The Company believes that its business is highly dependent upon the profitability of its customers in the airline and air cargo markets, and therefore, the Company’s profitability is affected by fluctuations in passenger and freight traffic and volatility of operating expenses, including the impact of costs related to labor, fuel and airline security.  Sales to the United States government also expose Stinar to government spending cuts and/or temporary shutdown of the government due to debt limits.  The United States Air Force, which historically has been a major purchaser of the Company’s equipment, is dependent upon governmental funding approvals.  Significant changes in raw material prices, such as steel and chassis, will also continue to impact our results.  As of March 24, 2017, the Company had approximately a $1,172,238 backlog. The backlog is due to commercial sales in the United States. The diversity of Stinar’s customer base and equipment lines helps mitigate the risks of Stinar’s business, as does the growing importance of marketing internationally, which provides Stinar with an additional customer base not influenced as greatly by U.S. economic conditions or U.S. politics.  We will also focus on key risk factors when determining our overall strategy and making decisions for allocating capital.  These factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook, product obsolescence, and the competitive environment.  


	The Company does not believe that the present overall rate of inflation will have a significant impact on the business segments in which it operates.


	 




	EMPLOYEES




	 


	As of June 30, 2016, the Company had 39 full-time employees.  


	A union does not represent the aviation segment employees, and the Company considers its labor relations to be good.

	The Company’s executive office for Oakridge Holdings, Inc. is leased at 400 West Ontario St., Unit 1003, Chicago, Illinois, 60654. 


	Stinar operates out of a single 43,271 square foot manufacturing facility in Eagan, Minnesota, located on 7.875 acres of land. The land consists of two contiguous parcels of real estate. The term note payable secured by the facility and land was entered into in February 2013 into three separate loans:  The first loan is for $762,000 at 5.2% for 20 years with monthly payments of principal and interest of $5,107.05 maturing in March 2033, the second loan is for $925,000 at 6% amortized over 20 years with a 10 year balloon, with monthly payments of principal and interest of $6,671.53, and the third loan is a bridge loan for $200,000 at prime plus 2.75% (6% at June 30, 2016) for three years with monthly payments of principal and interest of $6,090.54.  For current loan balances please see Note 6 of the financial statements. The condition of the manufacturing facility and office space is fair and will require approximately $67,000 of repairs to the building in the foreseeable future. The Company expects to finance with cash flow. Management reviews insurance policies annually and believes that all of its properties are adequately insured. 



	 





	ITEM 3:

	  

	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 


	The Company is a party to a number of legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.  While the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  As of June 30, 2016, there were no legal proceedings in either business.


	We carry insurance with coverages and coverage limits consistent with our assessment of risks in our businesses and of an acceptable level of financial exposure.  Although there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to mitigate all damages, claims or contingencies, we believe that our insurance provides reasonable coverage for known asserted or unasserted claims.  In the event the Company sustained a loss from a claim and the insurance carrier disputed coverage or coverage limits, the Company may record a charge in a different period than the recovery, if any, from the insurance carrier.

	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



	 


	The Company relies on cash flow from its aviation manufacturing company  to meet operating needs, fund debt service, and fund capital requirements.  The sale of the cemetery and Stinar operations did provide sufficient cash during fiscal year 2014 to support day-to-day operations, amended debt service, and capital expenditures.  During fiscal 2013, the Company amended and refinanced a majority of its debt.  Subsequent to these amendments and refinancing, Stinar, as of June 30, 2016, has two notes payable aggregating $1,504,560 which mature from January 2023 through March 2033.  Stinar also has a $472,145 term loan to finance inventories that matures in May 2018.


	Stinar’s capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100,000 under the five-year plan.  The funds are planned to be used for improvements of the manufacturing plant roof, equipment and parking lot.  These expenditures are expected to take place evenly over the five-year plan. Stinar’s capital expenditures for 2016 were approximately $9,600, $6,000 for various hand tools and equipment $2,800 for building improvements, and $800 for software and hardware equipment.  The Company expects to spend approximately $20,000, in fiscal year 2017 for capital expenditures. 



	 





	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — 201


	6 COMPARED TO 2015



	 



	STINAR OPERATIONS:  



	 


	In 2016, revenue decreased $1,057,922, or 18.9%, from $5,590,094 in 2015 to $4,532,172.  The decrease was primarily due to decreases in equipment sales in international sales and government sales.


	Cost of sales in 2016 was $4,460,496 or 98% of sales, compared to 106% in 2015.  Accordingly, gross income percentage increased to 1.6% in 2016, compared to a gross loss of -5.6% in 2016.  


	Selling expenses decreased $31,991, or 24.1%, from $132,469 in 2015 to $100,478.  The decrease was primarily due to less commission paid to international agents because of no international sales.


	General and administrative expenses increased $1,247, or 0.5%, from $253,221 in 2015 to $254,468.  The increase was immaterial.


	Interest expense on Stinar specific debt decreased $22,319, or 14.4%, from $155,398 in 2015 to $133,079.  The decrease was attributable to less chassis sales and decreased bank debt.


	 



	CORPORATE:



	 


	Robert C Harvey received no payments during the fiscal year 2016 for salary from either Oakridge Holdings, Inc. or Stinar. The salaries was satisfied by transferring assets with a portion forgiven to Mr. Harvey.


	General and administrative expenses were $272,168, an increase of $10,713, or 4% compared to 2015.  The increase was primarily due to higher salary accrued to Robert Harvey and higher legal fees.


	 


	 



	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — 2015


	 COMPARED TO 20


	14



	 



	STINAR OPERATIONS:  



	 


	In 2015, revenue increased $312,257, or 6%, from $5,277,837 in 2014 to $5,590,094.  The increase was primarily due to increases in parts sales and increases in Lavatory & Water Truck sales. 


	Cost of sales in 2015 was $5,902,117 or 106% of sales, compared to 84% in 2014.  Accordingly, gross loss percentage decreased to -6% in 2015, compared to a gross profit of 16% in 2014.  Having a gross loss is because of a write-off of inventory.  


	Selling expenses decreased $13,833, or 9.5%, from $146,302 in 2014 to $132,469.  The decrease was primarily due to no commission paid to international agents.


	General and administrative expenses increased $62,690, or 33%, from $190,531 in 2014 to $253,221.  The increase was primarily attributable to hiring a full-time controller. 


	Interest expense on Stinar specific debt decreased $26,864, or 14.7%, from $182,262 in 2014 to $155,398.  The decrease was attributable to less chassis sales and decreased bank debt.

	General and administrative expenses were $261,455, a decrease of $102,828, or 28% compared to 2014.  The decrease was primarily due to less salary accrued to Robert Harvey and less legal fees.


	Interest Expense was $0 or a decrease of $46,105, or 100% from 2014.  The decrease was due to the satisfaction of the debentures and short-term debt.

	DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



	An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  Notwithstanding the material weaknesses that existed as of June 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We continue to evaluate the potential steps to remediate such material weaknesses, as described below.


	 


	 



	MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING



	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a and 15d — 15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 


	 





	●    




	Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;





	 





	●    




	Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and





	 





	●    




	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.





	 


	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 


	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 Framework (the “COSO 2013 Framework”). Based on management’s assessment and those criteria, management believes that, as of June 30, 2016, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. 


	 



	Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with its assessment, management identified the following control deficiencies that represent material weaknesses at June 30, 2016:


	 





	●    




	Due to the limited number of Company personnel, a lack of segregation of duties exists.  An essential part of internal control is for certain procedures to be properly segregated and the results of their performance be adequately reviewed.  This is normally accomplished by assigning duties so that no one person handles a transaction from beginning to end and incompatible duties between functions are not handled by the same person. Our management plans to explore implementing cost-effective measures to establish a more formal review process in an effort to reduce the risk of fraud and financial misstatements.





	 





	●    




	Due to weaknesses in the Company’s financial reporting controls specifically relating to inventory at the Aviation Ground Support Equipment segment, management believes there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected, as happened with our 2009 — 2012 annual financial statements.  Management plans to explore implementing cost effective measures to improve its inventory reporting system in an effort to reduce the risk of a material misstatement of the financial statements.  





	 





	●    




	Due to the lack of expertise and personnel for financial reporting, the Company was not able to file required financial reports on time.





	 





	●    




	The Company did not have effective controls to provide reasonable assurance as to timely account reconciliations. Management believes that there is a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. Management plans to update management plans in an effort to reduce the risk and material misstatement of the financial statements.





	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Our management’s report of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls and procedures was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.


	 


	 



	CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING



	 


	During the year ended June 30, 2016, we continue our remediation efforts related to the following material weaknesses reported in the Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


	 





	●    




	Due to the limited number of Company personnel, a lack of segregation of duties exists.  An essential part of internal control is for certain procedures to be properly segregated and the results of their performance be adequately reviewed.  This is normally accomplished by assigning duties so that no one person handles a transaction from beginning to end and incompatible duties between functions are not handled by the same person.  Our management plans to explore implementing cost-effective measures to establish a more formal review process in an effort to reduce the risk of fraud and financial misstatements.

	●    




	Due to the lack of expertise and personnel for financial reporting, the Company was not able to file required financial reports on time.








	●    




	The Company did not have effective controls to provide reasonable assurance as to the proper recognition and recording of receivables and revenue. Management plans to consult with third party advisors who are knowledgeable regarding revenue recognition in an effort to reduce the risk and material misstatement of the financial statements.





	 


	As a result of the remediation efforts noted below, there were improvements in internal control over financial reporting during the Year ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. There were no other changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


	 



	Remediation Actions



	 


	In response to these material weaknesses, we developed remediation plans to address the control deficiencies identified in fiscal year 2015. We implemented the following remediation actions during the year ended June 30, 2016: 


	 


	Segregation of duties


	 





	●    




	Engaged a third party specialist for advice and consultation   








	●    




	Provided training and education to different accounting functions








	●    




	Established review controls





	 


	Financial reporting control


	 





	●    




	Provided training for calculating the cost of raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods. 








	●    




	Completed review of the Company's critical accounting and internal control policies with third party advisors that are knowledgeable regarding GAAP and internal controls








	●    




	Provided training and education relating to accounting for debt modifications and extinguishments








	●    




	Hired full-time financial controller to prepare consolidated financial statements





	 


	In addition to the above steps, management intends to continue its remediation efforts by:


	 





	●    




	Provide ongoing training and education relating to GAAP around complex and non-routine transactions specifically identified through regular review of emerging issues and Company business activities.








	●    




	Completing our review with the assistance of a third party advisor of the Company’s financial reporting controls and implementing recommended control procedures to strengthen the Company’s control procedures in areas which involve significant judgements and estimates, which involve application of complex accounting methods under GAAP, or which could have a material impact on the accuracy of our financial statements.





	 


	We are committed to a strong internal control environment, and believe that, when fully implemented, the remediation actions described above will represent significant improvements in the Company’s accounting and financial reporting functions. The Company has hired a full-time controller and had made tremendous progress with improving the training and education of staff and added the additional internal control processes designed to remediate these material weaknesses during the balance of 2015. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in connection with management’s future evaluations of internal control over financial reporting.

	Certain Relationships and Related Transactions



	 


	In the ordinary course of business, the Company may from time to time engage in transactions with other corporations whose officers, directors or employees are also directors or officers, or family members of directors or officers, of the Company.  The Company may also engage in transactions with individuals who are, or are family members of, directors or officers of the Company.  The Company has an unwritten policy under which the Audit Committee reviews these transactions to examine whether the transactions are conducted on an arm’s length basis.  The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to the Board whether to approve the proposed transaction, which the Board has historically always followed. In all cases, these related-party transactions have been conducted on an arm’s length basis, and none of the transactions require more specific disclosure under applicable SEC rules and regulations, except as described below.  


	The Company has a month-to-month operating lease for office space from the Chief Executive Officer and the total rent expense was $ 6,000 and $12,000 under this lease in fiscal years 2016 and 2015.


	 



	Director Independence



	 


	All of the Company’s directors, except for Robert Harvey and Robert Gregor, are “independent” as that term is defined in Rule 5605(a) of the Nasdaq Stock Market Marketplace Rules.  That is the standard for independence the Company has chosen for purposes of the disclosure required in this report by SEC rules (even though the Company’s Common Stock is not listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market).

	                         3.                        Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 


	 


	                         4.                        I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and I have:


	 


	                         a)                        designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;


	 


	                         b)                        designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

	                         5.                        I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):


	 


	                         a)                        all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and


	 


	                         b)                        any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of


	Oakridge Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary


	Eagan, Minnesota


	 


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Oakridge Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended.  Oakridge Holdings, Inc.’s management is responsible for these financial statements.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Oakridge Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiary as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	The Company




	 



	Nature of Business



	 


	Oakridge Holdings, Inc. is a Minnesota corporation organized on March 6, 1961. Oakridge Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary (the Company) operate an aviation ground support equipment business in Minnesota. On June 29, 1998, the Company acquired the net assets of an aviation ground support equipment business (Stinar). Stinar designs, engineers and manufactures aviation ground support equipment serving the United States Armed Services and businesses domestically and internationally.


	On June 20, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase with Kruckeberg Industries, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.  Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company and Stinar agreed to sell to Purchaser substantially all of the assets owned by Stinar including the premises located at 3255 Sibley Memorial Highway, Eagan, Minnesota 55121, used in the operation of the Business, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $300,000 in cash, subject to upward or downward adjustment based on the current liabilities to be purchased and assumed by Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement.  


	 



	2.


	          



	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	 



	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Oakridge Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary, which is wholly-owned. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 


	 



	Segment Reporting



	 


	The Company operates and manages the business under one reportable segment - the aviation ground support equipment.


	 



	Comprehensive Income (Loss) 



	 


	Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) and items defined as other comprehensive income (loss). Items defined as other comprehensive income (loss) include items such as foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on certain marketable securities. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no adjustments to net income (loss) to arrive at comprehensive income (loss). 


	 



	Fair Values of Financial Instruments



	 


	The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the methods and assumptions used to estimate such fair values, were as follows:



	Cash, accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and due to finance company

	 - Fair value approximates the carrying amount because of the short maturity of those financial instruments.



	Long-term debt and other notes payable

	 — Fair value is estimate d using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the interest rates that are currently available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as of June 30, 2016 and 2015. The fair value of long-term debt and other notes payable approximated their carrying values at June 30, 2016 and 2015.


	 



	Estimates and Assumptions



	 


	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Concentrations



	 



	Credit Risk



	 


	The Company's cash deposits from time to time exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its cash deposits in the past.


	Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company generally does not require collateral for its trade accounts receivable. One United States customer accounted for 30% or $143,761 of Stinar’s accounts receivable at June 30, 2016. Additionally, the U.S. Government accounted for approximately 30% and 0% of Stinar’s accounts receivable at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 



	Customers



	 


	A significant portion of the Company's customers are concentrated in the aviation industry. 


	Stinar’s net sales were concentrated as follows in 2016; international customers (1%), U.S. Government (7%) and North American are (92%). Stinar’s net sales were concentrated as follows in 2015: international customers (8%), U.S. Government (18%) and North American (74%)


	 



	Accounts Receivable



	 


	Accounts receivable are customer obligations generally due under normal trade terms for the industries served by the Company. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company's estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of accounts receivable. When management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected, all or a portion of the amount is charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts. It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts will change.


	 



	Inventories



	 


	Finished goods, component parts and work-in-process inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out [FIFO]) or market. The Company reviews inventory on an annual basis and provides an inventory reserve for slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventory, if necessary. As of June 30, 2016, the Company determined an obsolete inventory reserve of $150,000 to be necessary. The Company reserved $300,000 inventory reserve as of June 30, 2015.


	 



	Property and Equipment



	 


	Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and are generally depreciated over a 3 to 15 year period. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as incurred and significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.


	 



	Debt Issuance Costs

	 - Debt issuance costs are carried at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the related debt. Amortization of these debt costs, recognized and reported as interest expense for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, was $15,878 and $15,329, respectively.


	 



	Long-lived Assets



	 


	The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used, including but not limited to, capital assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose.


	 



	Product Warranty Liability



	 


	The Company’s warrants its products against certain defects based on contract terms. Generally, warranty periods are 14 months for equipment and 1 year for manufactured parts. The Company has recourse provisions for certain items that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranties. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company's estimated product warranty liability based on historical activity was $0 and $15,000, respectively.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	In May 2014, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures (GAAP). The core principles of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption ( which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2017. The Company currently plans to adopt the standard using the “modified retrospective method”, Under that method, we will apply the rules to all contracts existing as of January 1, 2018, recognizing in the beginning retained earnings an adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change and providing additional disclosure comparing results to previous accounting standards. Upon initial evaluation, we believe the requirements of this standard will not result in a significant change to our results.


	 



	Aviation Ground Support Equipment



	 


	Revenue is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.


	 



	Shipping and Handling Costs



	 


	All shipping and handling revenue is included in revenue. All direct costs to ship the products to customers are classified as cost of goods sold.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred income taxes. The significant temporary differences relate to research and development credit carry forwards, operating loss carry forwards, depreciation, inventories and certain accruals. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at the time, based upon available evidence, it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.


	The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Management also assesses whether uncertain tax positions, as filed, could result in the recognition of a liability for possible interest and penalties. The Company's policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company has not identified any material uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2016 and 2015.


	The Company files consolidated income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Company's tax years dating back to 2002 remain open to examination due to unexpired net operating loss carry forwards originating in and subsequent to that year.


	In October 2016, the Company filed tax year 2014 Federal Corporate Tax and Minnesota State Franchise Tax returns. As of June 30, 2016, the Company still owes $242,750 Minnesota State Franchise taxes plus interest.


	 



	Environmental Costs



	 


	Environmental expenditures that pertain to current operations or relate to future revenue are expensed or capitalized consistent with the Company's capitalization policy. Expenditures that result from the remediation of an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenue are expensed. Liabilities are recognized for remedial activities when the clean-up is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. 


	As requested by Kruckeberg Industries, LLC, from January 2016 to March 2016, Landmark Environmental, LLC conducted a Phase I Environmental test and a Supplemental Phase II Environmental test and revealed that areas of buried debris and impacted soils should be excavated and transported off-site for disposal to allow for future redevelopment of the Property. The quote for excavation is around $76,000. The Company is planning to do the excavation in 2017.


	 



	Advertising Costs



	 


	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.


	 



	Research and Development Costs



	 


	Research and development costs in the product development process are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of engineering and material costs relating to design and prototype development activities.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Net Earnings per Share



	 


	Basic net earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings (loss) per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, consisting of shares that might be issued upon the conversion of subordinated debentures and adjusting the net earnings (loss) applicable to common stockholders resulting from the assumed conversions. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	(a)        Revenue Recognition


	In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-14, "Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which extended the effective date of a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The new standard will now be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard.


	 


	(b)       Leases


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842 ” (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. The standard states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.


	             


	 (c )      Inventory


	 


	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, requiring that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This ASU is effective within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements.


	 


	(d)       Income Taxes


	 


	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740)” providing guidance on the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. The guidance effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements.


	 


	(e)      Statement of Cash Flows


	 


	During August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statements of cash flows. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to    each period presented. If retrospective application is impractical for some of the issues addressed by the update, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

	The Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
	2,325,000
	and $
	1,604,360
	, respectively. Net operating loss carry forwards expires beginning in 2028. Tax credit carryforwards expires beginning in 2018. 


	Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. The Company has determined that a valuation allowance of $
	797,000
	and $
	590,000
	, related to deferred tax assets is necessary at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.
