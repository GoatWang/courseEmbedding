Linda K. Massman to Succeed Gordon L. Jones as Clearwater Paper Chief Executive Officer


Mr. Jones to Retire From CEO, Chairman Role; Remain Director

 SPOKANE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Clearwater Paper Corporation (NYSE:CLW) today announced that

      Linda K. Massman will become the company's next chief executive officer,

      succeeding Gordon L. Jones, who will be retiring from his roles as chief

      executive officer and chairman of the board of directors, on December

      31, 2012.

    


      Ms. Massman, currently president and chief operating officer, will begin

      as president and chief executive officer, effective January 1, 2013. Ms.

      Massman will also join Clearwater Paper's board of directors at that

      time. Additionally, vice chairman and lead director of the board, Boh A.

      Dickey, has been appointed chairman of the board, effective January 1,

      2013.

    


      "Linda has been an integral part of the company's ability to design and

      execute its strategy from the beginning," said Mr. Dickey. "She came to

      Clearwater Paper as one of the company's original leaders after a rapid

      succession in finance and strategy development, and is now making the

      natural progression from chief operating officer to chief executive

      officer. She is the right person to lead Clearwater Paper as we enter

      our next phase of growth and development."

    


      "I have had the pleasure of working closely with Linda since the

      company's spin-off in 2008 and she has been an integral part of

      Clearwater Paper's success," said Mr. Jones. "Since that time, we have

      executed on our growth strategy and successfully transformed our company

      into one of the largest and most successful premium private label tissue

      and bleached paperboard producers in North America. Under Linda's

      leadership, I am confident Clearwater Paper will continue to build on

      this track record of success."

    


      Ms. Massman was appointed vice president and chief financial officer of

      Clearwater Paper in 2008, then named president and chief operating

      officer in November 2011. Before joining Clearwater Paper, Ms. Massman

      was group vice president, finance and corporate planning, for SUPERVALU

      Inc. Prior to this, Ms. Massman worked as a business strategy consultant

      for Accenture. Ms. Massman has more than 20 years of corporate finance

      and business strategy development experience and earned a Bachelor of

      Business Administration from the University of North Dakota and an MBA

      from Harvard Business School.

    


      Added Mr. Dickey, "Linda's customer-side experience, broad financial and

      strategic planning expertise with some of the country's biggest consumer

      brands and her knowledge of the company from day one give her the unique

      ability to lead Clearwater Paper and ensure the company's continued

      growth and success. We look forward to working with Linda as we build

      upon the strong foundation already in place and continue to execute our

      strategic priorities and create stockholder value."

    


      "I am honored to take on the role of CEO of Clearwater Paper at this

      time of great opportunity," said Ms. Massman. "Given the market dynamics

      within private label, our track record of success and strategic plan for

      growth, I believe we are well positioned to continue to enhance

      stockholder value. We remain focused on expanding the geographic and

      channel reach of Clearwater Paper while executing on our cost efficiency

      and integration synergy goals. I look forward to working with the board,

      management team and our dedicated employees to continue Clearwater

      Paper's achievements for customers and investors."

    


      "On behalf of the board and everyone at Clearwater Paper, I would like

      to thank Gordon for his leadership, commitment and countless

      contributions to our company," said Mr. Dickey. "We look forward to

      continuing to benefit from his experience as a director on the board,

      and we wish him all the best in his retirement."
