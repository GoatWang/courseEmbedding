 Tony Robbins on Being a Personality Brand

Tony Robbins






 
It’s an interesting and crazy thing…being a personality brand. People want to know everything about you: what your shoe size is, what you had for breakfast. You don’t have any privacy, ever. So, that’s the not-so-thrilling things, but the value of a brand is extraordinary. Once you have a brand, you have the most valuable commodity on earth.
If you have a brand that has fame attached to it, it adds another level of energy, so to speak. There are going to be people that are threatened by a brand when there’s a personality attached to it. It’s hard to be threatened by a Coke, but with a personality someone can say, “Oh my god, he change my life!”, or they can say, “Oh, he’s a piece of crap”, without ever knowing who I am. People have impressions of who they think you are, because of what they’ve made up, based on your celebrity. They’ve never met me, never talked to me, never been to an event of mine. It just comes with the territory. The other challenge with being a celebrity brand is that people want that “physical celebrity”. So, scalability becomes a challenge.
It’s a pretty amazing thing. I wake up every morning and half-a-milion people have, for the first time, opened up one of my books, audio, or video program. I’ve had 4-million people attend my live seminars. It didn’t happen just because I thought about it and hoped people would show up. I became a brand because I innovated and marketed continuously, and I still do.
If I had my choice, as a business person, I would just build a brand. I wouldn’t build a celebrity brand, because it would give me, frankly, more freedom. But for me, I never went into this for business, I got into this to change lives. I did it when I had no agent and was near bankrupt. I do it now, when I’m financially free. It fulfils me. So, in my case, I look at my “celebrity brand” and I know it opens doors. People already have an opinion about me; whether it’s negative or positive, there’s an energy to it. It allows me to touch more lives. Without it, I wouldn’t touch as many lives and that is why I love “branding”. It’s the “branding” that allows me to touch lives around the world.

1 Introduction
1.1 Baskin Robbins

Baskin-Robbins is a global chain of ice cream parlours founded by Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins in
1953, from the merging of their respective ice cream parlours, in Glendale, California.
Headquartered in Canton, Mass., Baskin-Robbins is part of the Dunkin’ Brands Inc. family of
companies. It claims to be the world's largest ice cream franchise, with more than 5,800 locations,
2,800 of which are located in the United States. Baskin-Robbins sells ice cream in 34 countries,
including Canada, Japan, Mexico, Bahrain, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt,
Saudi Arabia, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Bangladesh,
South Korea, India, Pakistan, Panama, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates.
The Baskin Robbins story in India began in 1993, when the first store opened in Mumbai. Today it is
spread across the country with more than 300 outlets in 61 cities. Baskin Robbins also caters to
other premium channels like star hotels, leading airlines, malls, multiplexes and top retail chains
across India. Baskin Robbins is one of the diverse businesses of the Graviss Foods Pvt. Ltd. It has an
exclusive franchise for the SAARC region. Our brand analysis is subjected to strategies of Baskin
Robbins in India only. But the brand has a global presence where it maintains a similar brand
strategy, yet with some small differences.


1.2 Ice Cream Industry in India

The ice cream market growth in India picked up after de-reservation of the sector in 1997. Of the
total size of Rs 15-16bn, around 30-32% is in the hands of organized sector valued at Rs 4.9bn, rest
all is with the unorganized sector.
The Indian government adopted a lot of policy changes for the liberalization regarding the ice
cream industry also and it is since then that this sector has shown an annual growth ranging from
15- 20% per annum for last 1- 2 year. In the Budget 2006-07 Excise Duty has been waived off on ice
creams.
In rural areas, kulfis / ice creams made by small / cottage industry are popular. The market for
organized sector is restricted to large metropolitan cities. In small towns and villages, there are
                                                                                                         Chapter: Introduction




thousands of small players who produce ice- creams / kulfis in their home backyard and cater to the
local market. Almost 40% of the ice creams sold in the country are consumed in the western region
with Mumbai being the main market, followed by 30% in the north and 20% in the south.




                                                                                                         1

    Baskin Robbins - A Brand Analysis                                                         September 2009


In India the ice cream industry is dominated by a few players. This has made the global giants look at
India to drive their growth. American ice-cream retailer Snowberry has announced that it would
invest $50 million by 2010 to start its business in India to be known as Snowberry India Private
Limited.
The sale of ice cream in India is seasonal and the ice cream makers always bet on the summer sales.
For Amul the summer season contributing about 40 per cent of the company's overall sales.
Furthermore, to take advantage of the demand during summer the Ice cream makers increase the
price of the products marginally .Most of the companies are adding that new and innovative
products that keep the consumers excited.

1.2.1 Segmentation and branding
The major volume growth for branded ice-cream players will come from the take-home-segment
rather than consumption at ice-cream boutiques and parlours. This is the key inference of a survey
conducted by Retail Research India (RRI). The survey attributes this shift in consumer priority to the
fact that ice-cream eating is becoming more of a weekend pastime for families rather than a leisure
activity during outstation trips or picnics.
The consumer perception audit reveals that branded ice-creams as a product category is now being
perceived as a product for the family rather than just as an indulgence during outing exercises
In terms of leveraging brand presence, the branded ice-cream players need to focus more on
innovative retail initiatives like point-of-sale merchandising and danglers to attract consumer
attention. The retail initiatives need to be given priority in comparison to the usual brand promotion
exercise that is carried out in the mass-media.
The ice-cream players have to confront secondary competition in the form of branded chocolates
and biscuits. Along with that they also face competition from unbranded ice-cream players who
operate on mobile cart wheels.It is believed that as a strategy to combat competition from products
across the impulse segment, the need is to have innovative modes of merchandising that can
enhance the display value for ice-cream brands.
Consumers from the impulse market make a consumption choice on the basis of the instant
attention that brands can grab by their innovative display.Further, with clutter in the mass media,
such initiatives at the shop floor level can play the dual role of initiating brand awareness as well as
triggering consumption for the brand.
                                                                                                           Chapter: Introduction




With secondary competitors from the branded players segment undertaking mega retail exercises,
branded ice-cream players will start witnessing consumer lapse if they are unable to consolidate
their retail presence




                                                                                                           2

Also, in terms of leveraging the brand through ice-cream parlours and vending machines, there is the
need to communicate the propositions through neon posters and vinyl signage, especially at specific
consumer eating spots. It is believed that some of the players may use such communication
exercises outside the parlours. But the need is to strategically evaluate consumer congregation
points.
The retail material should communicate the brand proposition through these materials at
strategically evaluated points since it can capture the consumers’ eye more than the usual exteriors
of retail shops and ice-cream outlets.Even in these avenues there are a host of other products that
are jostling for consumer attention. Hence, the need is to move away from these crowded venues in
parlours and retail shelves and specifically communicate the brand proposition in the spots where
there is less fragmentation yet a lot of consumer activity.
That's why, like Kwality Wall's, Amul too wants to take its frozen and ambient platter on the road
through push carts and smaller outlets. It plans to supply freezers to bakeries and chemists to mom-
and-pop shops and even STD booths. Even HLL has been trying hard to create excitement around its
brands. Its Kwality Wall's Max, for children, was relaunched with offerings, like Rainbow and Twister,
supported by a new look Max lion.

1.2.2 New Segments
Between kids and youth on the streets and adults at home, a large chunk of ice cream sales gets
taken care of. Impulse purchase from youth and kids accounts for 50 per cent of the market. Family
consumption adds another 35 per cent. Fifteen per cent of the market is in-parlour sale — a new
segment that has showed up in the last few years. This is dominated by niche regional players like
Naturals in the West, Nirula’s in the North and premium players like Baskin Robbins and the home
grown Italiano Gelato.

1.2.3 MNC in India:
The reason that the MNCs indicate for their presence in India is “It has the right climate for ice-
cream consumption; the country has a very low per capita consumption, which means large
untapped potential; and our ability to maintain competitive pricing - all these reasons make us want
to be in India.
But MNC weren’t successful in India mainly due to the pricing pressure and margin squeeze. Despite
                                                                                                         Chapter: Introduction




being a hot country with a young population, India has never made ice-cream culture its own, unlike
in the West.




                                                                                                         3

1.2.4 Infrastructure worries:
There are genuine problems, too. Since the demand for ice cream is seasonal, and it also requires
specific infrastructure. Any retailer with a tub full of ice can sell soft drinks, but for ice cream he has
to have proper refrigeration. For that, one requires proper power supply, which is erratic in India
Transporting ice cream across India requires massive infrastructure, because of which “supplies over
long distances are irregular”.

1.2.5 Consumption Pattern:
The market for ice-creams in India was estimated at US$265 million in 2006–07, growing at the rate
of 12–14 per cent. However, the per capita consumption of ice-cream in India is relatively low, when
compared to developed countries. Per capita consumption of ice-cream is around 250 mL per annum
as against 22 litres in the US, 18 litres in Australia, 14 litres in Sweden and 5 litres in the UK.The per
capita consumption of ice-creams in India is a paltry 250 ml per annum while the average global
consumption is 2 litres.




1.2.6 Ice Cream Flavours:
Indian Ice Cream market can be segmented in three different ways, namely on the basis of flavours;
on the basis of stock keeping units / packaging and on the basis of consumer segments. On the basis
of flavours the market today has a number of flavours like vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, mango,
                                                                                                              Chapter: Introduction




butterscotch a number of fruit flavours; dry fruit flavours traditional flavours like Kesar- Pista, Kaju-
Draksh etc. The market is totally dominated by Vanilla, Strawberry and chocolate, which together
account for more than 70% of the market followed by butterscotch and other fruit flavours.




                                                                                                              4

1.2.7 Distribution channel:
Ice cream distribution in India typically involves a distributor, wholesaler and retailer. Most domestic
brands have small regional operations, with plants situated near their major markets due to the lack
of cost-effective cold chain facilities. National brands have owned or leased cold storage facilities in
major metropolitan areas, which ship to distributors or direct to retailers. Some major brands have
begun serving smaller cities by acquiring smaller plants and improving distribution networks.
Distributors' margins are about 18-20%.

There are an estimated 70,000 retail ice cream outlets in India, including both fixed shops and
mobile vendors -- pushcarts, tricycles and three-wheelers.

2 Competitor Analysis
2.1 Competitors:
On a telephonic conversation, the Zonal Manager-South of Baskin Robbins, Mr. Muthukumar told us
that Baskin Robbins doesn’t have any direct competition as they are a premium player. He also told
us that theirs is not a volume based business. But he also accepted the fact that there is indirect
competition from domestic brands and other local parlours. Let us have a look at the competition in
India for Baskin Robbins.

Hindustan Unilever, which is owned 51 per cent by Unilever, has a 14 per cent share of the 100-
million litres and Rs 1,200-crore per annum ice cream market, which makes it the second largest
player after Amul (38 per cent market share). The gap is no less than 24 percentage points.




                            Chart: Market Share of Ice Cream Brands in India

Market leader Amul has a huge emotional connection with Indian consumers as it was the nerve
centre of the White Revolution in India. Its ice cream is available in no less than 70,000 stores across
the country — a number it plans to raise to 100,000 in the next one year. Its growth target for the
year is 20 per cent. (The market has grown at 15 per cent per annum in the last five years.)

Vadilal, the third largest player in the ice cream market with a share of 12 per cent and a strong
player in western India (Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat), has drawn up aggressive growth plans
                                                                                                           Chapter: Competitor Analysis




Mother Dairy (market share: eight per cent) has fanned out from its stronghold of North India to the
eastern and western parts of the country in the last few years. Its strength is the 4,000 pushcarts out
on the streets of the country at all times. As a large category of consumers buy ice cream on
impulse, this fleet has helped Mother Dairy grow 35 per cent this summer. Mother Dairy, by the

way, has developed a strong portfolio of local flavours which could work well in the upcountry
markets.


2.2 Competition in Parlours:
With the advent of modern trade, Baskin Robbins now covers 500 modern retail stores along with its
retail foot print of 370 outlets. Baskin Robbins will add 100 retail outlets during the year and also
grow our modern trade footprint. Modern Trade now contributes to 15 per cent of their overall
revenues and they see this growing to 20 per cent in the next couple of years. Baskin Robbins has
established its leadership in the premium ice cream category in the modern trade channel.

But competition is in no mood to give up without a fight. Amul too entered the segment this year
with its Scooping parlours where it serves sundaes, thick shakes and an exclusive range of ice cream.
It plans to have 1,000 franchises by the end of the financial year, up from the current 250, and
thereon add 1,000 every year for the next five years and expects retail to contribute to 20 per cent
of Amul’s ice cream revenue in the next three to five years.


2.3 Changing Times:
Across the world, consumers have turned health-conscious. They want to cut down calorie intake
because of the alarming spread of lifestyle ailments. And India is no different — it has the largest
population of diabetics anywhere in the world. Consumers have begun to look for health and
goodness in whatever they consume and ice cream is no exception. Baskin Robbins offers 100%
Vegetarian ice creams and it also offers low fat ice creams too.

Here, the lead has been taken by Amul. It has developed a portfolio on the health and wellness
platform with its probiotic and sugar-free category last year. Its sugar-free probiotic Frozen Food
contains 50 per cent less fat and half the calories than normal ice cream. “We expect this category to
account for ten per cent of the ice cream market in the next three years,” says Sodhi.

Hindustan Unilever too has got in to the act this year with the launch of its Selection range which
comes with just 99 calories in 80 ml. This, in fact, is a segment where the company can draw on the
                                                                                                          Chapter: Competitor Analysis




expertise of its parent, Unilever. With growing health consciousness, Heartbrand is developing
products that are lower in fat, sugar-free, lactose-free, as well as low-carb options and those with
more nutritional goodies like calcium and fruit. It has come out with new pack sizes which allow
lower consumption. About 40 per cent of the research budget goes to enhance properties of health
and wellness. Clearly, there is nothing better than a well-stocked parent.

3 Customer Analysis
Baskin Robbins is one of the premium ice cream brands in the world. Its differentiating strategy from
other ice cream brands or their brand identity is providing customers with 31 different varieties of
flavour and its premium quality. But how the customers perceive the brand is different and was
evaluated by an interview process. Around Thirty customers were interviewed who had already
experienced     or come across the brand. Also two US customers were included in these twenty
customers. We went for an interview process because we found that many had only an aided
recollection of the brand when asked about it.

The questions asked during the interview are

    a) How often do you have ice cream in a month?
    b) How do you experience having ice cream in Baskin Robbins store?
    c) In your opinion what attribute is differentiating Baskin Robbins from other ice cream
        brands?
    d) Did you ever come across the brand name in some promotions or ads or any other
        communication medium?
    e) What will come to your mind immediately if you hear the name Baskin Robbins?


Some of the inferences and key opinions extracted from this process are:
Most of the customers want ice cream parlour or store to be a better hang out place. They would
like to have ice creams with different flavours during chat with their colleagues or girl friends and
spend some time in a high end sophisticated premium parlours. They consider tasting a variety of ice
creams as a great experience.
The key insight derived from probing the customers is,
                        “I want to taste unique treats in a premium ambience”
Baskin Robbins’ proposition fits into this customer insight. But after the analysis we found that, they
provide premium offerings with different world class flavours but not the experience. Customers
who go there for repeat purchase is due to the addiction to the flavour taste. But, in providing
experience of having ice cream in their parlour is really pathetic. Most of the customers don’t value
                                                                                                          Chapter: Customer Analysis




the store as a premium store which Baskin Robbins claims.
Some of the attributes which customers think of Baskin Robbins are premium, young, feminine (an
influence from Pink colours they project), soft, tender and different flavours. Customers would like
to take young colleagues or girlfriends who are very peppy to this ice cream store. Even though this
brand lives for more than sixty years, they maintain youthfulness in the brand which is amazing. The

essence which customers expect from the brand is that “different premium offerings daily”.
Customers want to show or communicate to the world that they are different and premium.
Communication happens when the customer meets the brand. It came out that there is not frequent
communication in the form of TV ads or print ads or any other promotions. It’s mostly by word of
mouth and the purchasing point /store where the customers come across this brand. Before coming
to the store customers make up their mind to try different taste daily and hang out in the store
which is premium. They communicate that they are different but store is lacking a premium
ambience. This goes in a negative way of communication to the customer. Most of the store is
located in high class residential area. Customers think Baskin Robbins did not leverage in terms of
store ambience as most of the stores are so cramped and do not have a place to sit and have the ice
cream. This is a sort of negative communication, which should be immediately addressed since other
ice cream brands have started eyeing the modern retail format.

4 Communication Strategy
Baskin Robbins is a youthful, dynamic brand and they are open to good ideas. If there's a property or
event or opportunity that has the potential to capture the fancy of today's generation they are ready to
advertise/sponsor. The outlets sport a funky and vibrant look to attract young people.
In India, apart from the sales of ice creams, Baskin Robbins enjoys great patronage among high end
institutional clients ranging from the best five-star hotels in the country, to the premier airlines, high
end retailers, corporate parks and campuses, cruise companies, the best restaurants and clubs, and
of late, all the multiplexes, which is fast becoming a separate business channel in this country.
Around 35% of their sales are from institutional sales. In the coming years, the brand plans to
aggressively penetrate into the smaller towns apart from consolidating its present market in the
major cities and metros.


4.1 Promotions:


4.1.1   The Spiderman 3 campaign:
The summer of 2007 witnessed an innovative tie-up of Baskin Robbins with
Spiderman 3 movie in India. Baskin Robbins promoted Spiderman 3 by means
of a creative promotion. This not only added visibility but also enhanced
customer interactivity with the brand. The highlight of the promotion was the co-branded TVC which
was aired on key kids’ channels. The promotion extended to creating three new trendy flavours
keeping in tune with the characters of the movie- Web Slinger, Sand Storm, and Green Gobbler. The
elements of the promotion included poster, standee, cup design, bags, t-shirts, tags, shelf talker and
a Spiderman 3 comic free with every single scoop of ice cream.

4.1.2 The Paanchvi Pass campaign:
Baskin Robbins successfully captured the attention of the kids by entering into
a tie-up with ‘Paanchvi Pass’, a popular reality show telecast in 2008 by Star
Plus and hosted by Shahrukh Khan. A special Paanchvi Pass flavour was created
                                                                                                             Chapter: Communication Strategy




to make it appealing to the customers and add excitement to the entire campaign. A gift was
assured to any customer who walked into the store and purchased a Panchvi Paas flavour and 3
lucky draw winners got a chance to meet the biggest Bollywood star, Shahrukh Khan. The promotion
helped Star Plus take its message to niche audience across the country. The activity provided
tremendous on ground visibility for Star Plus and Baskin Robbins in terms of wall visuals, tent cards,

danglers, posters, t-shirts, cups, shelf talkers and a quiz book. Besides, it got good publicity and
generated enthusiasm among the kids.

4.1.3 The Drona campaign:
Baskin Robbins has become an attractive partner for Production Houses to
promote movies better among its target audience-the youth. This is done by
means of appealing visuals and colorful displays like banners, posters, standees
etc. Drona, a magical adventure movie based on the warrior ‘Drona’ tied up with Baskin Robbins to
promote the movie among the teenagers. Visual displays for the promotion of the movie using
Baskin Robbins as a brand included posters, standees, bags, shelf-talker, drop box and banner.
Cappuccino Nibs was named the Drona flavour, also known as the flavour of magic to get the touch
and feel of the movie. The Drona promotion gives kids across the country a chance to meet Abhishek
Bachchan through a lucky draw.

4.1.4 MTV Roadies 6.0:
MTV Roadies -a cult following among youth has now associated with Baskin
Robbins for promotion of the programme and for the integration of the brand
with its content. The promotion makes a lot of sense for both the brands
because the target audience of Roadies is synonyms with the target audience for Baskin Robbins.
The audition promotion was done in selected cities in India where the Roadies audition was carried
out-Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkatta, Ahemdabad, Chandigarh. JTQ-‘Jump the Queue’ passes
were given to those lucky draw winners who purchased Baskin Robbins ice cream worth Rs. 250/-.
Promotion was done through posters, banners, standees and the JTQ passes. Interactive games
during the auditions were incorporated which included wild games centered on ice cream.

4.1.5 The Love Story 2050 campaign:
The movie was unique in the sense that for the first time introduced the time
machine concept in the Indian film industry and therefore, there was a big hype
around the movie. Baskin Robbins built on this hype and therefore associated
                                                                                                       Chapter: Communication Strategy




itself with Love Story 2050. The publicity for the movie was done using posters, standees, banners
and shelf talkers. The flavour was called the 2050 Flavour with a tagline-The taste of the future is
here. The promotion offered a chance to the lucky draw winners to meet the debutant actor
Harmen Baweja and Priyanka Chopra and a chance to win a Boo (a character from the movie) with
every 2050 flavour.

4.1.6 Other Promos:
       Baskin Robbins National level Junior Cricket 7s tournament
        ‘Yo Yo Masters Road Show’ for Delhi’s children and adults, organised by Cartoon Network
        Enterprises, was held in Baskin Robbins store in Connaught Place, Delhi on July 2007.
       Sponsored lucky coupons for ‘Monsoon Masti’ festival organized by Rajiv Gandhi
        International Airport Limited, Hyderabad held on July 2009.
       Distributed free passes for “Amaze 2008”, B-School fest, organised by the Indian Institute of
        Planning and Management (IIPM) in Bangalore.
       Sold tickets for Rock Concert Rock ’n India, designed along the lines of international rock
        festivals, held in Bangalore in March 2008.
       Recently in March 2009, Pizza Hut & Baskin Robbins launched an offer that provides Pizza
        Hut patrons an opportunity to sample a range of Baskin Robbins ice creams, on placing pizza
        delivery orders.


4.2 Change in Communication Strategy:

The events/movies sponsored by Baskin Robbins have been not so effective in creating visibility for
the brand. This is because the brand seems to get lost in the array of other brands sponsoring the
events. Say, in launch of Spiderman 3, Baskin Robbins was one among 9 brands to sponsor. Also
when sponsoring MTV Roadies, we felt that the brand doesn’t communicate its value properly.
Because Roadies is an adventure reality show which depicts a tough person which is opposite to that
of Baskin Robbins’ core identity of fun and soft, tender nature conveyed by the brand as such.
From our interviews we found that around 21 people had only an aided recollection of the brand. All
these interviewees would rightly fit into the target segment of Baskin Robbins. Also we inferred that,
almost invariably all our interviewees never had any other interaction with the brand, apart from the
stores. So the brand has to enhance its visibility through strategic advertising and promotions where
it could reach its target segment better, frequently. Interesting thing that came up was that Baskin
Robbins has strong customer retention but new customer acquisition is not much. Only word-of-
                                                                                                           Chapter: Communication Strategy




mouth publicity has made the brand growing at least in the southern parts of India. Also we would
want the brand to communicate its premium status in all its touch points with the customer.
Please have a look at the following photograph of a bill given at a Baskin Robbins kiosk in Forum
mall, Bangalore. The bill is handwritten and is not even a printed one. As a customer of a premium
brand we would really feel bad when such an experience occurs. Though this might seem irrelevant
on a side, we have to acknowledge a fact that the customer goes for a premium brand with some
expectations. It is these small things like these which give the customer the brand’s identity.

                                                                                                           12

    Baskin Robbins - A Brand Analysis                                                       September 2009



5 Brand Baskin Robbins
From the customer analysis, communication strategy and the telephonic conversation had with the
Zonal manager-South of Baskin Robbins we conclude with the following.

5.1 Brand Strategy:
Trends: Few trends that favour the brand strategy in India are:

        Increasing disposable income of young Indians
        Increasing health consciousness of Indians(Low fat ice creams, vegetarian ice creams)

Customer Motivations: The customer motivations that could support the growth of the brand are,

        Flavours unique to Baskin Robbins
        I want to be seen as a premium consumer
        I need variety in my life

5.2 Brand Positioning:
                         “Taste different flavours everyday”-Baskin 31 Robbins

The younger generation in India now seek variety in their fast paced lives. They want to try
something new every day. Positioning Baskin Robbins in the minds of such consumers would be easy
and effective for the brand. We suggest to have a bridged positioning of,

                                     Baskin Robbins means TREAT

5.3 Brand Personality:
        Product Related Characteristics: Soft/Tender

        User imagery: Fun loving youth & children

        Sponsorships: Events that attract today’s generation youth & children

        Age: 60 years & still YOUNG!!!!!

        Symbol: Baskin Robbins logoRich & Inviting

5.4 Brand Identity:
                                                                                                         Chapter: Brand Baskin Robbins




        Core Identity: Variety in flavours, 100 percent vegetarian, Quality (The Zonal Manager whom
        we interviewed said that Baskin Robbins focuses on providing very high quality ice creams that
        even a 3 months old baby can consume it without any harm).

        Extended Identity: Ambience of Stores/Parlours, Packaging, Regional Flavours




                                                                                                         14

5.5 Value Proposition:
“Where the Fun is Unending & Flavour is King”

The value proposition is strongly supported by the offerings from Baskin Robbins. Just there needs to
be an improvement in Store ambience to provide that “Fun” element.

5.6 Brand Logo Evolution:
The brand logo has evolved over the years without losing out its core identity of the “Original 31
flavours”.




                                                                                                          Chapter: Brand Baskin Robbins




                                                                                                          15

6 Conclusion
Baskin Robbins is doing well with excellent quality offerings. All that has to be changed is the
communication strategy.Baskin Robbins has to create more touch-points for the prospective
customers to interact with the brand. But caution has to be taken that the premium brand doesn’t
get depicted as a mass market brand. Selective advertisements in premium magazines, lifestyle
television channels, malls, airports etc would do well. The brand can position itself as a premium
alternative to other mass market brands like Kwality Walls, Vadilal, Amul etc. Also more visibility can
be created by maintaining premium ice cream parlours with excellent ambience that would generate
Word-of-Mouth, the most powerful form of positioning the brand.

                                                                                                          16

Love & Relationships
Stop punishing your partner
When we get upset in a relationship, it really comes from a place of fear – fear that someone or something isn’t going according to plan. So we react by trying to regain control of the situation. And one of the most common – and also most damaging – ways that we do that is […]

Mind & Meaning
The new brand of mindfulness

            Posted by:

            Kerry Song

Have you had any experience with Eastern philosophy? Or have you ever been to a yoga class? Actually, have you ever just browsed through Instagram? Then chances are you’ve heard the word “mindful,” perhaps many times. It’s use has grown tremendously over the past decade, with a sharper increase starting about 4-5 years ago. But what exactly does it mean to be mindful?
Like many definitions, it all depends on who you ask. For some, it’s about living in a meditative state, that is, one that is thoughtful and calm. For others, it’s more about being present and not judging others in the world around you. But the common thread that runs through every definition is that mindfulness is an ideology.
For me, the importance is about putting that ideology into action, and doing so in a way that is practical. Because ethos and ideology are the perfect backdrop to living in a beautiful state, but if you don’t have conventional ways to apply it to everyday life, then it’s all for naught.
So what is the conventional wisdom for practicing mindfulness? How do you apply it to everyday life? Try asking yourself these simple questions, and you’ll begin to see how making such small shifts in your life can lead to big results:
WHAT’S IN YOUR MEDICINE CABINET?
Open your medicine cabinet and take a look at the products you use on a daily basis. Do you know what their ingredient list is? Do you know where they come from or how they were made?

It’s easy to shop blindly – to purchase a product based on the prominence of the brand or the appeal of the label. But so many of the sprays, makeup, gels, lotions and formulas we are putting on our bodies on a regular basis may actually be doing more harm than good.
Toxins and chemicals are a big part of the problem. From parabens to phthalates and aluminum, the chemicals used in a number of common health products are leeching into our bodies and wreaking havoc. Know what is in your shampoo. Find out what your shower gel and shaving cream are made out of. That lotion you use to moisturize – does it have any harmful chemicals? What about your deodorant, or your lipstick or aftershave?
You can also be mindful by asking what went into developing the product you are using. Sadly, despite the big steps we’ve made in the past 20 years to reduce animal-testing, an inhumane practice that perpetuates suffering, a number of companies still use it. I, personally, do not want to purchase a product that in any way supports this cruelty. I want to live in a world that chooses compassion and kindness over anything else. So I choose brands that are in alignment with those values as well. You can find out which companies do not use animal testing here.
WHERE DOES YOUR FOOD COME FROM?
This part of mindfulness isn’t about restriction or reduction. And it’s not about saying “be mindful of that piece of cake you are eating, ask yourself if you are really hungry or are trying to comfort yourself.” While I can appreciate the ideology behind that, sometimes you just want to indulge. Everything in moderation, right?

This is about knowing what is in your food and where it comes from. Are you eating processed food loaded with additives and preservatives? Or are you nourishing your body with whole foods that are truly clean? Are you buying organic and local? Or are your foods treated with pesticides?
Make it a point to read the ingredients label and take note of what you are putting into your body. This will make you more in-tuned with your habits and patterns, and help you make better decisions when it comes to how you fuel and energize your body.
WHAT DOES YOUR BODY NEED?
Exercise should be a vital part of your day, even if only for 20 minutes. It not only has a number of well-known physical benefits, it can also enhance your mental and emotional state. But being mindful doesn’t mean pushing yourself to go all-out on the treadmill, or pressuring yourself to bike 50 miles when you are exhausted. It means paying attention to your body and asking yourself what you really need.

When I need to energize myself, I opt for a brisk run outside. If cardio sounds like too much for my body that day, but I still have energy, I’ll choose a challenging yoga class. Or when I’m feeling a little more subdued, and my body is asking for a recovery day, I’ll take a walk. Then there are still some other days where stress and restlessness beg to be released with a really intense cardio session.
Being mindful isn’t about forcing yourself to work out every day. It’s about taking note of how your body feels and giving it what it needs. Make it a point to assess your physical state every morning. Not only will you become more in tune with your needs, you will be able to take care of yourself in an entirely new way.
HOW DO YOU FEED YOUR MIND?
Do you get news updates on your phone? How often do you stream live news coverage on your computer? Does morning and evening news bookend your day?

While it’s important to be aware of what’s happening in the world around you, it’s also important to be mindful of what type of news you are consuming. Odds are, the news you are reading and listening to revolves around death, destruction and devastation. After all, there’s a phrase about the news – “if it bleeds, it leads.” Because bad news sells.
But it’s important to take note of what this constant exposure to violence and negativity is doing to your mental and emotional state.
British psychologist, Dr. Graham Davey, told the Huffington Post that exposure to negative and violent media could actually have long-lasting psychological effects. In fact, Davey maintains that “viewing negative news means that you’re likely to see your own personal worries as more threatening and severe, and when you do start worrying about them, you’re more likely to find your worry difficult to control and more distressing than it would normally be.”
Tony tells us to constantly strive to feed our minds. He tells us that every single day, we must stand guard at the doors to our mind and take a proactive approach to what we allow in.
What’s wrong is always available, but so is what’s right – educational podcasts, biographies of great men and women, personal development programs. Every opportunity you have, whether it’s in the car on the way to work, or unplugging 30 minutes before sleep, opt to feed your mind with something that empowers, educates and enlightens. You will be amazed at what a difference it can make in the long run.
ARE YOU BEING COMPASSIONATE WITH YOURSELF?
Be gentle with yourself.
There are enough external forces in the world that are simply out of our control. And there is enough negativity to overcome without bringing it on ourselves. Yet so many of us are our own worst critics. We see flaws when we look in the mirror. We beat ourselves up for not having accomplished enough. We get down on ourselves for not performing as well as we believe we should have.

But by focusing on the negative we only exacerbate the problem. And by compounding the issue at hand, we disempower ourselves. Take note of what you say to yourself when you look in the mirror. Take a moment to reflect on how hard you are on yourself. And when you find yourself becoming your own worst enemy, stop, and make the mental shift. Immediately change your words, thoughts and patterns into something positive and empowering. By finding a new direction that is more productive, you will find new opportunities for growth.
Take care of yourself. Be gentle, with your words, your thoughts and your actions.
IS IT LOVE OR EGO?
Throughout the day, be mindful of where your thoughts, feelings, words and actions are coming from. Ask yourself, is this coming from my ego? That is, my need to be special, better and unique? Or is it coming from a place of love? If it is coming from a place of love, then this is your authentic self.
Is it love, or is it ego? This question can be applied for everything from why you want to pursue a certain goal, to how you react when your partner does something you don’t agree with. Either way, it will help you shed the layers that mask your authentic self, and help you understand who you truly are on a more intimate level.
