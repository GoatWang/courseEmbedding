KEITH S. SHERIN TO RETIRE FROM GE AFTER 35 YEARS OF SERVICE RICHARD A. LAXER TO LEAD GE CAPITAL







KEITH S. SHERIN TO RETIRE FROM GE AFTER 35 YEARS OF SERVICE RICHARD A. LAXER TO LEAD GE CAPITAL
August 30, 2016

























Boston, MA - August 30, 2016 – GE announced today that Richard A. Laxer, GE Capital International president and CEO, will lead GE Capital effective September 1, 2016 as President and CEO. Keith S. Sherin, GE vice chairman and GE Capital chairman and CEO, will retire from GE effective December 31, 2016.  
 
Keith Sherin, 57, led the successful transformation of GE Capital into a smaller, more focused company after a career in business leadership positions across GE, including 15 years as GE Chief Financial Officer. Richard Laxer, 55, started his career in GE’s Financial Management Program in 1984 and has held leadership positions in Finance and later as CEO of major GE Capital businesses around the globe.  He has been the leader of GE Capital’s international operations since 2009 and has been named a senior vice president of GE. 
 
Jeff Immelt, GE chairman and CEO, said, “We are very fortunate to have an executive of the caliber of Rich Laxer to succeed Keith Sherin in leading GE Capital.  Rich has a long and distinguished track record of leadership at GE and is ideally suited to lead GE Capital in its new role supporting GE’s industrial growth.”  
 
GE Capital going forward will consist of three global businesses, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), GE Energy Financial Services and GE Industrial Finance, all of which support the growth of GE’s industrial businesses and customers.
 
Regarding Keith Sherin’s contributions to GE, Jeff Immelt said, “For 35 years, Keith has dedicated himself to the General Electric Company.  As a vice chairman, he has had a direct influence on the company’s direction, its financial health and its position as the world’s premiere digital industrial company.  During his 15 years as GE CFO, Keith served with utmost integrity and provided a thoughtful steady voice as we navigated a world of volatility.”  
 
“Since April 2015, Keith has led the flawless execution of our strategy to reposition GE Capital. I thank Keith immensely for his relentless passion for 35 years to do right by all – our shareholders, customers and employees. Keith is a special leader, immensely talented yet humble. In the history of GE, few can match his impact.”

GE CFO Keith Sherin: Fiscal Cliff Deal Likely by Years End but it Won’t Fix U.S. Deficit
Posted By: Adminon: November 16, 2012In: News Print Email
Keith Sherin, GE
General Electric‘s Keith Sherin, chief financial officer, said that if Congress were to solve the fiscal cliff by the end of the year, the problem would not end there, Reuters reports.
Speaking at an event sponsored by MIT’s Sloan School of Management, Sherin said the primary responsibility of the elected officials is to manage the country’s deficit and “they’re not getting it done.”
“It’s in everybody’s interest to find some way to have a bipartisan solution to deal with our deficit situation, which cannot continue obviously at the level they’ve been,” he added. “It’s going to be a combination of raising revenue and cutting long-term spending.”
GE refinanced a $5 billion bond in order to avoid any disruptions to debt markets that could result if the U.S. economy went over the fiscal cliff and the company now holds enough cash on hand to run for more than a year without accessing capital markets, Sherin said.
Sherin said he believes the Congress will not be able to solve all the fiscal  problems by December but it is “highly likely” they will solve the budget problems by setting up a timetable for the long term.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
