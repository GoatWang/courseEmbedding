No Product Sales


You deserve advice thatavoids even a potentialconflict of interest.That’s exactlywhat you get with Stewardship. Why settle forless?








Flat-Fee-Only / HourlyNever a Percentage


If you think fees don’t matter or are all the same, think again. Fees play a huge role in the return on your investments, especially over long periods of time. 





Stewardship typically charges a small fraction of “traditional” financial planning fees. Explore our “fees” section to learn more. 








Retirement Solved!


For many people, just thinking about retirement finances provokes anxiety. Unfortunately, ignoring or delaying typically makes things worse.





Retirement planning is our specialty. A few adjustments may help more than you realize. Put our expertise to work for you! 








Independent


One hundred percent of Stewardship’s revenue comes from clients, which means 100% of our focus is on clients’ best interests. We have no other obligations and proudly act as fiduciaries.



 










Financial Advice you Can Trust









Fees
			The financial services industry too often puts its own interests ahead of the client’s, most especially when it comes to fees.​ Most people pay too much and get too little. Understand the fees you pay, then decide if you’re getting your money’s worth.

 


Investments
			We work closely with you to understand your time horizons and tolerance for volatility, then recommend appropriate no-load mutual funds and / or ETFs. We encourage, but don’t require, clients to open accounts at Vanguard. 








Services
			Most clients engage us for retirement planning, investing, college savings, insurance needs analysis and / or cash flow and budgeting. We also assist with unique situations and handle business 401(k)s.

 


Start
			Our process is simple and begins with a 5 to 10 minute phone conversation followed by a complimentary face-to-face meeting.














John Belluardo
Founder







Financial Advice You Can Trust Is a Bold Assertion.Sound too good to be true? Please explore our website and decide for yourself.















 Clients are encouraged, but not required, to open accounts at Vanguard. Regardless, you always maintain control and possession of your investments but can permission Stewardship to execute trades on a non-discretionary basis.
