Time for Clear Thinking


On-Site Generation (OSG) of cleaning and antimicrobial solutions is an inevitable future. The processes involved in using packaged chemicals simply cost too much and pose too many environmental and health hazards. OSG solves those problems by turning ordinary tap water and salt into highly effective cleaning solutions. Learn more about Orbio® On-Site Generation.

Provides scale to accelerate growth and improve profitability in
      EMEA;Expands Tennant Company’s product portfolio and
      market coverage



 MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Tennant Company (NYSE: TNC), a world leader in designing, manufacturing
      and marketing of solutions that help create a cleaner, safer, healthier
      world, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of IP
      Cleaning S.p.A. and its subsidiaries (IPC Group) from private equity
      fund Ambienta for $353 million (€330 million). The privately held IPC
      Group, based in Italy, designs and manufactures innovative professional
      cleaning equipment, tools and other solutions.
    

      Commented Chris Killingstad, Tennant Company's president and chief
      executive officer: “Our acquisition of IPC Group aligns with our
      aspirations to grow Tennant’s revenue and profitability. The addition of
      IPC will more than double Tennant’s current EMEA business, providing the
      scale needed to accelerate our growth and better leverage our EMEA cost
      structure. Our businesses are highly complementary and differentiated in
      our geographies, products and go-to-market approach. We are excited
      about our combined potential to significantly increase our market share
      in Europe.”
    

IPC Group produces small- to mid-sized commercial cleaning machines and
      equipment, including floor sweepers and scrubbers, vacuum cleaners,
      high-pressure washers, and related aftermarket parts and services. IPC
      Group also expands Tennant Company’s product portfolio to cleaning tools
      and supplies, such as multi-purpose cleaning trolleys, window-washing
      systems, antibacterial microfiber mops and cloths, and a wide array of
      consumables. Like Tennant, IPC Group is committed to product innovation
      and sustainability, with a focus on reducing energy, water and detergent
      use.
    

IPC Group sells its products under the brand names IPC, IPC Foma, IPC
      Eagle, IPC Gansow, ICA, Vaclensa, Portotecnica, Sirio and Soteco, Ready
      System, Euromop, and Pulex. Both companies’ brands will continue to
      operate in their markets, as they do today, as part of Tennant’s
      multi-brand portfolio.
    

      Tennant anticipates that the IPC acquisition will be accretive to the
      2018 full year earnings per share.
