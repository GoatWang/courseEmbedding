                        Corporate Governance                        
                    Leading by example is of paramount importance to the directors and management team at Aton Resources. As a Canadian company operating in Egypt, we are committed to replicating Canada’s industry leading mining standards. BOARD COMPOSITION AND SELECTIONOrganizationThe Board shall consist of a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7 directors, as determined from time to time by the directors following a recommendation by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Directors are elected annually by the Company’s shareholders. A majority of the directors shall be “independent” within the meaning of applicable rules of securities regulatory authorities and stock exchanges.Selection of New DirectorsDirectors so appointed by the Board will serve only until the next annual meeting unless re-elected by the shareholders at that time. Nominees for membership on the Board will be recommended to the Board by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The Board will then recommend the nominees to the shareholders for election at the annual meeting. In selecting nominees as new directors, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will assess the ability to contribute to the effective management of the Company, taking into account the needs of the Company and the individual’s background, experience, perspective, skills and knowledge that is appropriate and beneficial to the Company.Election of DirectorsEach director should be elected by the vote of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any meeting for the election of directors. Accordingly, if any nominee for director receives, from the shares voted at the meeting in person or by proxy, a greater number of shares withheld than shares voted in favour of his or her election, the director must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board, to take effect on acceptance by the Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will expeditiously consider the director’s offer to resign and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept it.This policy does not apply to a contested election of directors, that is, where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected. Any director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the deliberations of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or the Board. In the event any director fails to tender his or her resignation in accordance with this policy, the Board will not renominate the director. The Board is not limited in any action it may take if a director’s resignation is accepted, including appointing a new director to fill the vacancy.Director OrientationManagement of the Company, working with the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will provide an orientation process for new directors, including providing background materials on the Company and its business. As appropriate, management will prepare additional educational sessions for directors on matters relevant to the Company and its business. Directors are also encouraged to take advantage of other available educational opportunities that would further their understanding of the Company’s business and enhance their performance on the Board.FUNCTIONING OF THE BOARDNumber and Schedule of MeetingsThe Board will hold a minimum of four regularly scheduled meetings per year. Prior to the end of each year, the Secretary will propose a schedule of Board meetings for the following calendar year for consideration by the Board. Additional meetings may be held from time to time as necessary or appropriate.AgendaThe Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer will establish the agenda for each regularly scheduled Board meeting, giving consideration to any suggestions from other members of the Board. Any director may suggest agenda items and may raise at meetings other matters that they consider worthy of discussion.Distribution of MaterialsThe agenda and the related information and data that is important to the Board’s understanding of the business to be discussed for each regularly scheduled meeting and, where feasible, each special meeting, will be distributed sufficiently in advance of the meeting to provide a reasonable opportunity for review, except when such material is too sensitive to be put in writing.AttendanceDirectors should make reasonable efforts to attend all meetings of the Board of Directors and of all Board committees upon which they serve. To prepare for meetings, directors should review the materials that are distributed in advance of those meetings. Although the Board recognizes that, on occasion, circumstances may prevent directors from attending meetings, directors are expected to ensure that other commitments do not materially interfere with the performance of their duties. Subject to extenuating circumstances (such as illness, for example), directors are expected to attend a minimum of 66% of regularly scheduled Board and committee meetings. Directors should also make reasonable efforts to attend the annual meeting of shareholders of the Company.Access to Management and AdvisorsThe Company will provide directors with complete access to the management of the Company. The Board of Directors and Board committees, to the extent set forth in the applicable committee mandate, have the right to consult and retain independent legal and other advisors at the expense of the Company. Directors are entitled to reasonably rely on advice from outside advisors such as lawyers, accountants, engineers or other persons whose profession lends credibility to a statement by such person. Directors should assess the qualifications of any such advisors and the processes such advisors use to reach their decisions and recommendations.Board LeadershipThe Board of Directors reserves the right to determine, from time to time, how to configure the leadership of the Board and the Company in the way that best serves the Company.DIRECTOR RESPONSIBILITIESMandateThe Board is responsible for the stewardship of the Company and for the supervision of the management of the business and affairs of the Company. The Board has adopted a written mandate setting out specific areas of responsibility, including responsibilities relating to oversight of management, financial and risk matters, business strategy, communications and reporting, corporate governance and Board organization.Share OwnershipThe Board believes that directors should be shareholders and have a financial stake in the Company. The Board has established minimum share ownership standards for directors and will review such standards from time to time. Such minimum share ownership requirements will be disclosed annually in the Company’s management information and proxy circular.Contact with Analysts, Investors and the MediaThe Company’s Disclosure Policy provides that directors, officers and employees who are not authorized spokespersons must not communicate information regarding the Company to the investment community, the media or others, unless specifically requested to do so by an authorized spokesperson. Directors receiving inquiries from analysts, investors, the media or others should refer them to the Chief Executive Officer or other authorized spokesperson identified in the Company’s Disclosure Policy.Conduct and Ethics Standards for DirectorsThe Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Directors are required to comply with such Code.Committees of the BoardThe Board may establish such committees as it deems appropriate and delegate to them such authority permitted by applicable law and the Company’s bylaws as the Board sees fit.The committees will operate in accordance with applicable law, their respective mandates as adopted and amended from time to time by the Board, and the applicable rules of securities regulatory authorities and stock exchanges.All of the members of each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall be directors whom the Board has determined are “independent”, taking into account applicable rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities and stock exchanges.Each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will hold periodic in camera sessions during which the members of the committee will meet in the absence of members of management of the Company.CompensationThe Compensation Committee will make recommendations to the full Board of Directors as to the form and amount of director compensation, including cash, equity-based awards and other director compensation. The Company recognizes that it is important to set director compensation at an appropriate level so that it does not compromise any director’s independence. Directors’ compensation will be determined based on this principle, taking into account market practices for comparable companies, and will reflect an appropriate balance between cash and equity.Term LimitsThe Board believes that there is value to having continuity of directors who have experience with the Company. Accordingly, there are no limits on the number of terms for which a director may hold office.RetirementIndividuals may serve as directors of the Company until the age of 72. Except as provided below, directors shall retire at the next annual meeting of shareholders of the Company after such director’s 72nd birthday. Upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board may propose to the shareholders of the Company that a director be re-elected after reaching 72 years of age if it is in the best interests of the Company.Directors will be required to tender a proposed letter of resignation from the Board upon the occurrence of any of the following events: the director’s principal occupation or business associations change materially; failure to attend at least 66% of regularly scheduled Board and committee meetings during the preceding calendar year; or any other change occurs in the personal or professional circumstances of the director that might reasonably be perceived as adversely affecting the director’s ability to effectively serve as a director of the Company. In such circumstances, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will review the director’s continuation on the Board and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether the Board should accept the director’s resignation or request that the director continue to serve.Other Board ServicesThe Board does not believe that its members should be prohibited from serving on boards and committees of other organizations and, accordingly, has not adopted any guidelines limiting such activities. The number of other boards and committees that a director sits on will be left to the discretion of the individual director. However, directors should recognize that board and committee service requires significant time and attention in order to properly discharge their responsibilities.If a member of the Company’s Audit Committee simultaneously serves on the audit committees of more than three public companies, the Board, with the assistance of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, will consider the matter and determine whether such simultaneous service may impair the ability of such member to serve on the Company’s Audit Committee.Management Evaluation and SuccessionThe Compensation Committee is responsible for conducting an annual review of the performance and compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and reporting to the Board of Directors in connection with such performance and compensation. The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board as appropriate in connection with the Company’s succession planning with respect to the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executive officers.Performance EvaluationThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will conduct an annual evaluation to determine whether the Board, its committees and individual directors are functioning effectively and will report its findings and make any appropriate recommendations to the full Board. The Board will discuss the evaluation to determine what, if any, action could improve Board, Board committee or individual director performance.Review of GuidelinesThe Board of Directors, with the assistance of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, as appropriate, shall review these Corporate Governance Guidelines on an annual basis to determine whether any changes are appropriate.Amendment, Modification and WaiverThese Guidelines may be amended, modified or waived by the Board of Directors and waivers of these Guidelines may also be granted by the Corporation.CompanyAbout UsManagementCorporate GovernanceCorporate AdvisorsTSX-V: AAN$0.04HomeCompanyAbout UsManagementCorporate GovernanceCorporate AdvisorsInvestor RelationsInvestment HightlightsReports and PresentationsStock InfoShare StructureMedia CoverageASM 2017ProjectsAbu Marawat ConcessionNews20172016EgyptContactRSS Feed© Copyright 2017Aton Resources Inc.All rights reserved.

Aton Resources Inc. announced that it has made a new VMS discovery, named the Waayrah prospect, at the Company's 100% owned Abu Marawat concession, located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. Highlights: Aton has discovered VMS (volcanogenic massive sulphide) style mineralization at Waayrah; Field inspection and sampling of the Prospect has defined the presence of three structurally complex zones of VMS style mineralization, weathered to massive gossans at surface, with at least two of these zones hosting high-grade Au-Zn-Ag-Cu mineralization; Initial grab and channel sampling at Waayrah has returned assays up to 16.4 g/t Au, 24.6% Zn, 62.7 g/t Ag and 1.93% Cu; Waayrah demonstrates that Abu Marawat may have the potential to host additional VMS deposits, like other VMS camps in the Arabian Nubian Shield. Further, Aton's geologists have recognized potential VMS style mineralization in the Miranda South area, which opens up the possibility that a belt favorable to the development of VMS mineralization may extend between Miranda South and Waayrah.


Aton Provides Regional Target Identification Program Update
Jun 7 17
Aton Resources Inc. provided investors with the results from the first phase of the regional target identification program at the Company's 100% owned Abu Marawat concession, located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. Aton's geologists have visited and carried out preliminary field inspections and sampling at Abu Gaharish, Bohlog, Waayrah, Black Gaharish, Semna East, Sir Bakis, and West Garida prospects. Waayrah, Black Gaharish, and Semna East represent new areas of interest within the Abu Marawat Concession. Results have been received for the Abu Gaharish and Bohlog prospects, and results from the other areas sampled are expected in June. Potential for the development of intrusion related and structurally controlled orogenic gold mineralization has been identified at Bohlog and Abu Gaharish, respectively, with visible gold identified in samples from both locations.


Aton Resources Inc. Reports Results of the Final Eight Drill Holes from the 12-Hole Diamond Drill Program, at Hamama West
May 18 17
Aton Resources Inc. reported the results of the final eight drill holes from the recently completed 12-hole diamond drill program, totaling 1975 metres, at Hamama West. Hamama West is one of three zones that comprise Hamama, located within the Company's 100% owned Abu Marawat concession ("Abu Marawat" or the "Concession") in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. Holes HAD-005, 010, 011 and 012 were planned to test the potential for increasing sulphide resources on the eastern flank of the MZ at Hamama West. Today's assay results confirm that potential. Holes HAD-006 and 007 were drilled towards the south, and tested the Crocs Nose Zone, south of the Main Zone. The high grade intersection from hole HAD-007 extends the mineralization previously intersected in surface trench HAT-113 and holes AHA-045 and AHA-046 to the east. The mineralization at the Crocs Nose Zone has only had limited testing to date, and is interpreted as being a faulted offset of the Main Zone mineralization, which strikes under the Nubian Sandstone unconformity. This zone was not included in the Hamama West resource estimate and the new drilling results confirms the potential to delineate additional near surface resources in this area.

Here’s why oil just scored its biggest one-day rally of 2017

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

About Us

 

Aton International, Inc. | Mountain View, California

 Mobile Apps | Consulting | Software Design and Development
Our specialties are native code, server access and host integration.
 


History

Established in California in 1981, we shipped our first product, a personal computer operating system, that same year. Our customers were located in the USA and internationally. Our first embedded system product was developed in 1984. As Windows became a major operating system, we expanded into desktop applications which evolved to client/server networks. Our expertise continued to grow from Windows 9x to Windows NT to Windows 2000 to Windows XP and Windows XP Embedded. We entered the Internet arena in 1994 and expanded into Web server applications in 1996.
Aton entered the mobile arena in 2002, offering our first Pocket PC mobile application to connect to IBM mainframes which was used by enterprises, universities, government and web administrators and consultants to solve server issues remotely. Our latest apps focus on Linux and UNIX server access for Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8 Store (Metro).
Our custom development clients leverage our wide ranging experience to speed development  and avoid costly mistakes and delays. Our company is situated between San Francisco and San Jose allowing us to take advantage of the unique creative, business and technology resources available in Northern California to build better products and systems for our clients. Aton International, Inc., is a woman-owned small business.

Secures Two Year Extensions to the Terms of Its Two Exploration Licenses at Abu Marawat and Fatiri from the Government of Egypt Until July 2018MarketwiredJuly 19, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jul 19, 2016) -  Aton Resources Inc. (the "Company") (TSX VENTURE:AAN) is extremely pleased to announce the approval by the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority ("EMRA") to extend the term for the exploration phase on its Fatiri and Abu Marawat concessions by two years until July 2018.Mark W. Campbell, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said, "We are very pleased with the support given to us by EMRA and the Ministry of Petroleum. The extensions to the exploration terms are an important part in providing the Company due time to advance both the development of our flagship Hamama project at Abu Marawat and the exploration of our exciting Fatiri concession. We believe that this decision demonstrates the Ministry of Petroleum's and EMRA's commitment to the development of Egypt's mineral resource sector. EMRA has been a very helpful and supportive partner and we are very pleased to be working closely with them." Campbell further commented, "The positive drilling results at the Hamama on the Abu Marawat concession and the potential bonanza gold grades at Rouh Al Hadid on the Fatiri concession, confirm the potential for significant deposits within our two concession areas. Further showing the potential that Aton has at two of the most exciting areas anywhere in the world today." The award of the term extension to the licenses was a result of EMRA and the Ministry of Petroleum's recognition of the challenges the company weathered and the delays associated with the political transition in Egypt, operating environment and global market conditions that impacted the rate at which the Company was able to explore its two concessions.About Aton Resources Inc. Inc.:Aton Resources Inc. (TSX VENTURE:AAN) is a focused gold exploration company, working in Egypt exploring for and developing economic gold deposits in the Central Eastern Desert of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS). The Company's 100%- owned concessions, Abu Marawat and the Fatiri, combined cover 2,772 square kilometers of underexplored ground. Evidence of gold on the concessions dates the many surface workings to pre-historic (Copper Age) and Old Kingdom (Pharaonic), through Ptolemaic and Roman and into Early Arab times and the early 20th century European period. Several historic gold mines and numerous gold showings and gossans occur within the two concessions.The Company's land package is located some 400 km southeast of Cairo and is enhanced by expanding infrastructure, including access to highway and railway right-of-way, a high-capacity electricity grid, and nearby major cities; Qena, on the Nile River, and Port of Safaga, on the Red Sea, only 50 km to the East.ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF ATON RESOURCES INC.Mark W.
