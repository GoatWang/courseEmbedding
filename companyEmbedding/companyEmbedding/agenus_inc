Harnessing the Immune System

Vaccines

Combination Therapies

Vaccines



At Agenus, our extensive experience in immuno-oncology has led us to the forefront of cancer candidates with our three platform technologies:
Prophage™, an individualized vaccine made from a patient’s own tumor tissue
AutoSynVax™, a vaccine uniquely designed and manufactured for each patient based on their tumor profile
PhosphoSynVax™, an off-the-shelf vaccine targeting a novel class of tumor antigens.
All three platforms are designed to treat cancers based on the unique needs of each patient. Most cancer cells carry unique mutations or biochemical signatures (for example: protein phosphorylation patterns) that are not present in healthy cells. Our vaccines are either based on these specific mutations found in the tumor cells of the patient or on aberrantly phosphorylated proteins that are specific to different types of cancer and/or patient. Our platforms are designed to alert the patient’s immune system to recognize these differences by targeting mutant protein antigens. The result would be to attack cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unaffected.
Prophage™ Vaccine
The Prophage vaccine platform involves extracting peptides (protein fragments) from a patient’s tumor that are naturally bound to heat shock protein gp96 (HSPPC-96), allowing us to identify key proteins of interest. Subsequently, Prophage is designed to mobilize multiple immune processes to attack the tumor.
We are currently conducting clinical trials of Prophage vaccines in glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer. The standard of care treatment for glioblastoma is surgical resection, when possible, followed by radiation and chemotherapy. With today’s treatments, the vast majority of patients survive only 16 months or less.
At ASCO in June of 2015, we reported results from a single-arm, open-label, multi-institutional Phase 2 trial of Prophage in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (ndGBM) in combination with the standard of care treatment of surgical resection, radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. We reported that patients with ndGBM had a substantial improvement both in progression-free survival and overall survival with Prophage combined with standard of care compared to historical control data. 
In addition, it was found that the most significant improvements (median progression-free survival approximating 27 months, median overall survival approximating 44.7 months) were seen in the seventeen patients with less elevated expression of the checkpoint protein PD-L1 on the circulating cells known as peripheral blood monocytes. This suggests that patients, who are thought to be less immuno-suppressed when first diagnosed with ndGBM, could benefit from adding Prophage vaccination to standard of care. It also raises the possibility that Prophage may be beneficial in the other half of patients who are more immuno-suppressed (those who have greater PD-L1 expression on peripheral blood monocytes at baseline) by adding checkpoint modulators that block PD-1 or PD-L1 to Prophage plus the standard of care.
AutoSynVax™ Vaccine
The immune system has the capacity to “see” cancer antigens or mutated molecules on cancer cells as foreign or abnormal and unleash an attack that destroys these cancerous cells. However, the number of mutations varies from one patient’s tumor to another. Current research suggests that our natural immune defense mechanisms may be insufficient to eliminate cancers in cases where mutations are too few in number. Even when cancer cells display many mutations, they can evade effective recognition by the immune system through a variety of immunosuppressive mechanisms. Agenus’ AutoSynVax cancer vaccine is being designed to boost immune recognition of cancer antigens to a higher level than that which is achieved naturally. The vaccine therefore may help the immune system better recognize cancer antigens even if there are only a small number of them on a given patient’s tumor. AutoSynVax is expected to work synergistically with other forms of immunotherapy including checkpoint inhibitors and other checkpoint modulators that counteract immune evasion mechanisms.
AutoSynVax is an individualized vaccine made by combining synthetic versions of each patient’s own cancer antigens with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). HSP70 is known to transport protein fragments called epitopes and to play a part in displaying them to T cells, immune cells that, when sufficiently activated, can mount a potent anti-tumor response. We identify the unique genetic sequence of an individual patient’s cancer and apply proprietary computational tools to predict which mutations, unique to that patient, are likely to be displayed by the tumor in the form of “neo-epitopes.” Accurate prediction of these neo-epitopes increases the likelihood that our AutoSynVax vaccine will stimulate a robust T cell response against tumors.
We then synthesize these neo-epitopes in the form of short peptide sequences. After linking these peptides to HSP70 in our GMP-certified manufacturing facility, we plan to administer AutoSynVax vaccine along with our QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant to provide maximum efficacy.  By including numerous synthetic cancer antigens in each patient’s AutoSynVax vaccine, we increase the likelihood that tumors will be recognized by the immune system.
PhosphoSynVax™ Vaccine
Our third vaccine platform is PhosphoSynVax, based on technology we obtained when we acquired PhosImmune. PhosphoSynVax is being designed to induce immunity against a novel class of tumor specific neo-epitopes: those arising from inappropriate phosphorylation of various proteins in malignant cells. In cancer cells, the disruption of normal biochemical signaling can result in aberrant protein phosphorylation (the addition of phosphate groups on sites that would not be altered in normal cells). Some of these misphosphorylated proteins can be processed into antigens by the cellular machinery, resulting in presentation of this new type of antigen on the cell surface.
We have a library of more than one thousand proprietary phosphopeptide tumor target antigens characteristic of many different cancers, including lung cancer, specific leukemias, ovarian cancer, colon cancer and others. We believe that using our PhosphoSynVax vaccines to teach the immune system to recognize these neo-epitopes can lead to the destruction of cancer cells. This technology is thus unique to Agenus and potentially very powerful in various patients across cancer types.

Agenus is a Lexington, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company focused on immunotherapy including immuno-oncology, a field that uses the power of the immune system to control or cure cancer. The company is developing checkpoint modulators (CPMs), patient-specific anti-cancer vaccines, and adjuvants that can be used with a range of vaccines. CPM development is a particularly fast-moving field, since early products have produced unprecedented clinical benefits for patients.[1] In light of the advances made, Science magazine hailed cancer immunotherapy as its 2013 Breakthrough of the Year.[2]

History[edit]
Agenus (formerly Antigenics Inc.) was founded in 1994 by Garo H. Armen and Pramod K. Srivastava. The company has pioneered immunotherapies, including heat shock protein-based cancer vaccines, a program that has developed into its Prophage Series of personalized anti-cancer vaccines. Antigenics became a public company in February 2000 on the NASDAQ exchange with the ticker symbol AGEN. In 2000 Agenus acquired Aquila Biopharmaceuticals and a year later it acquired Aronex Pharmaceuticals. In February 2014 the company acquired a European firm, 4-Antibody, along with their portfolio of checkpoint modulators (CPMs) and a platform (Retrocyte Display® technology) to rapidly and efficiently discover new antibodies.




CEO Garo Armen


In October 2013, Agenus CEO Garo Armen issued a press release revealing that after an 18-month follow up on the RTS,S Malaria vaccine using QS21-Stimulon® is working well enough to support a regulatory filing in 2014. This is the first proof of the efficacy of Agenus's patented "QS-21 Stimulon" adjuvant [3]
In April 2014, Agenus inked a deal with Merck potentially worth $100 million. Under the terms of that deal, Agenus is using its proprietary Retrocyte Display technology to discover antibodies against a pair of undisclosed checkpoint targets for the treatment of cancer. Agenus has advanced two of its own CPM candidates into early drug development and the company is planning to advance several more antibodies in clinical trials.
Today, Agenus is focused on developing a range of immuno-oncology products, including the Prophage vaccines, multiple checkpoint modulators (also known as checkpoint inhibitors or checkpoint antibodies) and its QS21-Stimulon adjuvant. The company’s personalized, heat shock protein-based vaccines are in Phase 2 studies. The QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant platform is partnered with GlaxoSmithKline and Janssen. Several of those collaborations involve Phase 3 trials. Altogether, the company and its partners are sponsoring approximately 20 clinical trials of Agenus products.
Key Partners and Deals[edit]
Merck: April 2014, Agenus announced a deal worth potentially $100 million with Merck. The deal involves the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies to two undisclosed Merck checkpoint targets, both thought to be relevant for cancer treatment. Agenus will use its proprietary Retrocyte Display® platform to discover and optimize antibodies against the targets.
4-Antibody: February 2014, Agenus acquired European biotechnology firm 4-Antibody, along with its Retrocyte Display technology and a portfolio of checkpoint modulator antibody candidates .
Ludwig Cancer Research: 4-Antibody had been working on the checkpoint targets for several years in collaboration with Ludwig Cancer Research, one of the world’s most renowned institutions for research into cancer and the immune system. The leader of the Ludwig collaborative laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Jedd Wolchok, is recognized as one of immuno-oncology’s leading pioneers.
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK): March 2012, GSK paid Agenus $9 million to include additional rights to the two firms’ agreement around Agenus’ QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant. The deal amended license and manufacturing terms. It also included royalty payments to Agenus for an undisclosed indication upon commercialization of a vaccine.
Product Descriptions[edit]
Checkpoint Modulators (CPMs) interfere with cancers’ ability to “hijack” natural immune defense systems. To protect the body against disease, but without attacking healthy cells, the immune system uses multiple “checkpoint” systems. Some checkpoints stimulate immune responses while others inhibit them. Cancer cells can evolve means to evade checkpoints, and CPMs can reverse that effect, helping the immune system better fight the cancer.
Agenus currently has programs targeting the checkpoint modulators GITR, OX40, CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3 and PD-1. The company is expanding that portfolio by using its proprietary Retrocyte Display® discovery system to generate fully human therapeutic antibody drug candidates. The platform is a high-throughput approach incorporating IgG format human antibody libraries expressed in mammalian B-lineage cells.
The Prophage Series of patient-specific cancer vaccine candidates can also enhance the immune system’s response to tumors. Because each cancer is unique, the vaccine is derived from the patient’s own tumor sample. To process these samples, Agenus has established a multi-product Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility, which has already helped process over 1,000 tumor samples from across the globe.
The company's QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant platform strengthens and broadens immune responses to antigens on cancers or foreign invaders’ surfaces. Agenus has multiple partnerships around this product to study its effects with vaccines for diseases including Alzheimer’s, melanoma, and malaria. In October 2013, GlaxoSmithKline and Agenus announced positive data from an 18-month follow-up of GSK’s RTS,S malaria vaccine with QS21-Stimulon. GSK stated that the treatment was working well enough to support a regulatory filing. RTS,S is the most advanced vaccine for malaria in development.

Agenus is a Lexington, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company focused on immunotherapy including immuno-oncology, a field that uses the power of the immune system to control or cure cancer. The company is developing checkpoint modulators (CPMs), patient-specific anti-cancer vaccines, and adjuvants that can be used with a range of vaccines. CPM development is a particularly fast-moving field, since early products have produced unprecedented clinical benefits for patients.[1] In light of the advances made, Science magazine hailed cancer immunotherapy as its 2013 Breakthrough of the Year.[2]

History[edit]
Agenus (formerly Antigenics Inc.) was founded in 1994 by Garo H. Armen and Pramod K. Srivastava. The company has pioneered immunotherapies, including heat shock protein-based cancer vaccines, a program that has developed into its Prophage Series of personalized anti-cancer vaccines. Antigenics became a public company in February 2000 on the NASDAQ exchange with the ticker symbol AGEN. In 2000 Agenus acquired Aquila Biopharmaceuticals and a year later it acquired Aronex Pharmaceuticals. In February 2014 the company acquired a European firm, 4-Antibody, along with their portfolio of checkpoint modulators (CPMs) and a platform (Retrocyte Display® technology) to rapidly and efficiently discover new antibodies.




CEO Garo Armen


In October 2013, Agenus CEO Garo Armen issued a press release revealing that after an 18-month follow up on the RTS,S Malaria vaccine using QS21-Stimulon® is working well enough to support a regulatory filing in 2014. This is the first proof of the efficacy of Agenus's patented "QS-21 Stimulon" adjuvant [3]
In April 2014, Agenus inked a deal with Merck potentially worth $100 million. Under the terms of that deal, Agenus is using its proprietary Retrocyte Display technology to discover antibodies against a pair of undisclosed checkpoint targets for the treatment of cancer. Agenus has advanced two of its own CPM candidates into early drug development and the company is planning to advance several more antibodies in clinical trials.
Today, Agenus is focused on developing a range of immuno-oncology products, including the Prophage vaccines, multiple checkpoint modulators (also known as checkpoint inhibitors or checkpoint antibodies) and its QS21-Stimulon adjuvant. The company’s personalized, heat shock protein-based vaccines are in Phase 2 studies. The QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant platform is partnered with GlaxoSmithKline and Janssen. Several of those collaborations involve Phase 3 trials. Altogether, the company and its partners are sponsoring approximately 20 clinical trials of Agenus products.
Key Partners and Deals[edit]
Merck: April 2014, Agenus announced a deal worth potentially $100 million with Merck. The deal involves the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies to two undisclosed Merck checkpoint targets, both thought to be relevant for cancer treatment. Agenus will use its proprietary Retrocyte Display® platform to discover and optimize antibodies against the targets.
4-Antibody: February 2014, Agenus acquired European biotechnology firm 4-Antibody, along with its Retrocyte Display technology and a portfolio of checkpoint modulator antibody candidates .
Ludwig Cancer Research: 4-Antibody had been working on the checkpoint targets for several years in collaboration with Ludwig Cancer Research, one of the world’s most renowned institutions for research into cancer and the immune system. The leader of the Ludwig collaborative laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Jedd Wolchok, is recognized as one of immuno-oncology’s leading pioneers.
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK): March 2012, GSK paid Agenus $9 million to include additional rights to the two firms’ agreement around Agenus’ QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant. The deal amended license and manufacturing terms. It also included royalty payments to Agenus for an undisclosed indication upon commercialization of a vaccine.
Product Descriptions[edit]
Checkpoint Modulators (CPMs) interfere with cancers’ ability to “hijack” natural immune defense systems. To protect the body against disease, but without attacking healthy cells, the immune system uses multiple “checkpoint” systems. Some checkpoints stimulate immune responses while others inhibit them. Cancer cells can evolve means to evade checkpoints, and CPMs can reverse that effect, helping the immune system better fight the cancer.
Agenus currently has programs targeting the checkpoint modulators GITR, OX40, CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3 and PD-1. The company is expanding that portfolio by using its proprietary Retrocyte Display® discovery system to generate fully human therapeutic antibody drug candidates. The platform is a high-throughput approach incorporating IgG format human antibody libraries expressed in mammalian B-lineage cells.
The Prophage Series of patient-specific cancer vaccine candidates can also enhance the immune system’s response to tumors. Because each cancer is unique, the vaccine is derived from the patient’s own tumor sample. To process these samples, Agenus has established a multi-product Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility, which has already helped process over 1,000 tumor samples from across the globe.
The company's QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant platform strengthens and broadens immune responses to antigens on cancers or foreign invaders’ surfaces. Agenus has multiple partnerships around this product to study its effects with vaccines for diseases including Alzheimer’s, melanoma, and malaria. In October 2013, GlaxoSmithKline and Agenus announced positive data from an 18-month follow-up of GSK’s RTS,S malaria vaccine with QS21-Stimulon.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Agenus is a Lexington, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company focused on immunotherapy including immuno-oncology, a field that uses the power of the immune system to control or cure cancer. The company is developing checkpoint modulators (CPMs), patient-specific anti-cancer vaccines, and adjuvants that can be used with a range of vaccines. CPM development is a particularly fast-moving field, since early products have produced unprecedented clinical benefits for patients.[1] In light of the advances made, Science magazine hailed cancer immunotherapy as its 2013 Breakthrough of the Year.[2]

History[edit]
Agenus (formerly Antigenics Inc.) was founded in 1994 by Garo H. Armen and Pramod K. Srivastava. The company has pioneered immunotherapies, including heat shock protein-based cancer vaccines, a program that has developed into its Prophage Series of personalized anti-cancer vaccines. Antigenics became a public company in February 2000 on the NASDAQ exchange with the ticker symbol AGEN. In 2000 Agenus acquired Aquila Biopharmaceuticals and a year later it acquired Aronex Pharmaceuticals. In February 2014 the company acquired a European firm, 4-Antibody, along with their portfolio of checkpoint modulators (CPMs) and a platform (Retrocyte Display® technology) to rapidly and efficiently discover new antibodies.




CEO Garo Armen


In October 2013, Agenus CEO Garo Armen issued a press release revealing that after an 18-month follow up on the RTS,S Malaria vaccine using QS21-Stimulon® is working well enough to support a regulatory filing in 2014. This is the first proof of the efficacy of Agenus's patented "QS-21 Stimulon" adjuvant [3]
In April 2014, Agenus inked a deal with Merck potentially worth $100 million. Under the terms of that deal, Agenus is using its proprietary Retrocyte Display technology to discover antibodies against a pair of undisclosed checkpoint targets for the treatment of cancer. Agenus has advanced two of its own CPM candidates into early drug development and the company is planning to advance several more antibodies in clinical trials.
Today, Agenus is focused on developing a range of immuno-oncology products, including the Prophage vaccines, multiple checkpoint modulators (also known as checkpoint inhibitors or checkpoint antibodies) and its QS21-Stimulon adjuvant. The company’s personalized, heat shock protein-based vaccines are in Phase 2 studies. The QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant platform is partnered with GlaxoSmithKline and Janssen. Several of those collaborations involve Phase 3 trials. Altogether, the company and its partners are sponsoring approximately 20 clinical trials of Agenus products.
Key Partners and Deals[edit]
Merck: April 2014, Agenus announced a deal worth potentially $100 million with Merck. The deal involves the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies to two undisclosed Merck checkpoint targets, both thought to be relevant for cancer treatment. Agenus will use its proprietary Retrocyte Display® platform to discover and optimize antibodies against the targets.
4-Antibody: February 2014, Agenus acquired European biotechnology firm 4-Antibody, along with its Retrocyte Display technology and a portfolio of checkpoint modulator antibody candidates .
Ludwig Cancer Research: 4-Antibody had been working on the checkpoint targets for several years in collaboration with Ludwig Cancer Research, one of the world’s most renowned institutions for research into cancer and the immune system. The leader of the Ludwig collaborative laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Jedd Wolchok, is recognized as one of immuno-oncology’s leading pioneers.
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK): March 2012, GSK paid Agenus $9 million to include additional rights to the two firms’ agreement around Agenus’ QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant. The deal amended license and manufacturing terms. It also included royalty payments to Agenus for an undisclosed indication upon commercialization of a vaccine.
Product Descriptions[edit]
Checkpoint Modulators (CPMs) interfere with cancers’ ability to “hijack” natural immune defense systems. To protect the body against disease, but without attacking healthy cells, the immune system uses multiple “checkpoint” systems. Some checkpoints stimulate immune responses while others inhibit them. Cancer cells can evolve means to evade checkpoints, and CPMs can reverse that effect, helping the immune system better fight the cancer.
Agenus currently has programs targeting the checkpoint modulators GITR, OX40, CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3 and PD-1. The company is expanding that portfolio by using its proprietary Retrocyte Display® discovery system to generate fully human therapeutic antibody drug candidates. The platform is a high-throughput approach incorporating IgG format human antibody libraries expressed in mammalian B-lineage cells.
The Prophage Series of patient-specific cancer vaccine candidates can also enhance the immune system’s response to tumors. Because each cancer is unique, the vaccine is derived from the patient’s own tumor sample. To process these samples, Agenus has established a multi-product Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility, which has already helped process over 1,000 tumor samples from across the globe.
The company's QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant platform strengthens and broadens immune responses to antigens on cancers or foreign invaders’ surfaces. Agenus has multiple partnerships around this product to study its effects with vaccines for diseases including Alzheimer’s, melanoma, and malaria. In October 2013, GlaxoSmithKline and Agenus announced positive data from an 18-month follow-up of GSK’s RTS,S malaria vaccine with QS21-Stimulon. GSK stated that the treatment was working well enough to support a regulatory filing. RTS,S is the most advanced vaccine for malaria in development.

Agenus is a Lexington, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company focused on immunotherapy including immuno-oncology, a field that uses the power of the immune system to control or cure cancer. The company is developing checkpoint modulators (CPMs), patient-specific anti-cancer vaccines, and adjuvants that can be used with a range of vaccines. CPM development is a particularly fast-moving field, since early products have produced unprecedented clinical benefits for patients.[1] In light of the advances made, Science magazine hailed cancer immunotherapy as its 2013 Breakthrough of the Year.[2]

History[edit]
Agenus (formerly Antigenics Inc.) was founded in 1994 by Garo H. Armen and Pramod K. Srivastava. The company has pioneered immunotherapies, including heat shock protein-based cancer vaccines, a program that has developed into its Prophage Series of personalized anti-cancer vaccines. Antigenics became a public company in February 2000 on the NASDAQ exchange with the ticker symbol AGEN. In 2000 Agenus acquired Aquila Biopharmaceuticals and a year later it acquired Aronex Pharmaceuticals. In February 2014 the company acquired a European firm, 4-Antibody, along with their portfolio of checkpoint modulators (CPMs) and a platform (Retrocyte Display® technology) to rapidly and efficiently discover new antibodies.




CEO Garo Armen


In October 2013, Agenus CEO Garo Armen issued a press release revealing that after an 18-month follow up on the RTS,S Malaria vaccine using QS21-Stimulon® is working well enough to support a regulatory filing in 2014. This is the first proof of the efficacy of Agenus's patented "QS-21 Stimulon" adjuvant [3]
In April 2014, Agenus inked a deal with Merck potentially worth $100 million. Under the terms of that deal, Agenus is using its proprietary Retrocyte Display technology to discover antibodies against a pair of undisclosed checkpoint targets for the treatment of cancer. Agenus has advanced two of its own CPM candidates into early drug development and the company is planning to advance several more antibodies in clinical trials.
Today, Agenus is focused on developing a range of immuno-oncology products, including the Prophage vaccines, multiple checkpoint modulators (also known as checkpoint inhibitors or checkpoint antibodies) and its QS21-Stimulon adjuvant. The company’s personalized, heat shock protein-based vaccines are in Phase 2 studies. The QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant platform is partnered with GlaxoSmithKline and Janssen. Several of those collaborations involve Phase 3 trials. Altogether, the company and its partners are sponsoring approximately 20 clinical trials of Agenus products.
Key Partners and Deals[edit]
Merck: April 2014, Agenus announced a deal worth potentially $100 million with Merck. The deal involves the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies to two undisclosed Merck checkpoint targets, both thought to be relevant for cancer treatment. Agenus will use its proprietary Retrocyte Display® platform to discover and optimize antibodies against the targets.
4-Antibody: February 2014, Agenus acquired European biotechnology firm 4-Antibody, along with its Retrocyte Display technology and a portfolio of checkpoint modulator antibody candidates .
Ludwig Cancer Research: 4-Antibody had been working on the checkpoint targets for several years in collaboration with Ludwig Cancer Research, one of the world’s most renowned institutions for research into cancer and the immune system. The leader of the Ludwig collaborative laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Jedd Wolchok, is recognized as one of immuno-oncology’s leading pioneers.
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK): March 2012, GSK paid Agenus $9 million to include additional rights to the two firms’ agreement around Agenus’ QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant. The deal amended license and manufacturing terms. It also included royalty payments to Agenus for an undisclosed indication upon commercialization of a vaccine.
Product Descriptions[edit]
Checkpoint Modulators (CPMs) interfere with cancers’ ability to “hijack” natural immune defense systems. To protect the body against disease, but without attacking healthy cells, the immune system uses multiple “checkpoint” systems. Some checkpoints stimulate immune responses while others inhibit them. Cancer cells can evolve means to evade checkpoints, and CPMs can reverse that effect, helping the immune system better fight the cancer.
Agenus currently has programs targeting the checkpoint modulators GITR, OX40, CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3 and PD-1. The company is expanding that portfolio by using its proprietary Retrocyte Display® discovery system to generate fully human therapeutic antibody drug candidates. The platform is a high-throughput approach incorporating IgG format human antibody libraries expressed in mammalian B-lineage cells.
The Prophage Series of patient-specific cancer vaccine candidates can also enhance the immune system’s response to tumors. Because each cancer is unique, the vaccine is derived from the patient’s own tumor sample. To process these samples, Agenus has established a multi-product Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility, which has already helped process over 1,000 tumor samples from across the globe.
The company's QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant platform strengthens and broadens immune responses to antigens on cancers or foreign invaders’ surfaces. Agenus has multiple partnerships around this product to study its effects with vaccines for diseases including Alzheimer’s, melanoma, and malaria. In October 2013, GlaxoSmithKline and Agenus announced positive data from an 18-month follow-up of GSK’s RTS,S malaria vaccine with QS21-Stimulon. GSK stated that the treatment was working well enough to support a regulatory filing. RTS,S is the most advanced vaccine for malaria in development.

Agenus is a Lexington, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company focused on immunotherapy including immuno-oncology, a field that uses the power of the immune system to control or cure cancer. The company is developing checkpoint modulators (CPMs), patient-specific anti-cancer vaccines, and adjuvants that can be used with a range of vaccines. CPM development is a particularly fast-moving field, since early products have produced unprecedented clinical benefits for patients.[1] In light of the advances made, Science magazine hailed cancer immunotherapy as its 2013 Breakthrough of the Year.[2]

History[edit]
Agenus (formerly Antigenics Inc.) was founded in 1994 by Garo H. Armen and Pramod K. Srivastava. The company has pioneered immunotherapies, including heat shock protein-based cancer vaccines, a program that has developed into its Prophage Series of personalized anti-cancer vaccines. Antigenics became a public company in February 2000 on the NASDAQ exchange with the ticker symbol AGEN. In 2000 Agenus acquired Aquila Biopharmaceuticals and a year later it acquired Aronex Pharmaceuticals. In February 2014 the company acquired a European firm, 4-Antibody, along with their portfolio of checkpoint modulators (CPMs) and a platform (Retrocyte Display® technology) to rapidly and efficiently discover new antibodies.




CEO Garo Armen


In October 2013, Agenus CEO Garo Armen issued a press release revealing that after an 18-month follow up on the RTS,S Malaria vaccine using QS21-Stimulon® is working well enough to support a regulatory filing in 2014. This is the first proof of the efficacy of Agenus's patented "QS-21 Stimulon" adjuvant [3]
In April 2014, Agenus inked a deal with Merck potentially worth $100 million. Under the terms of that deal, Agenus is using its proprietary Retrocyte Display technology to discover antibodies against a pair of undisclosed checkpoint targets for the treatment of cancer. Agenus has advanced two of its own CPM candidates into early drug development and the company is planning to advance several more antibodies in clinical trials.
Today, Agenus is focused on developing a range of immuno-oncology products, including the Prophage vaccines, multiple checkpoint modulators (also known as checkpoint inhibitors or checkpoint antibodies) and its QS21-Stimulon adjuvant. The company’s personalized, heat shock protein-based vaccines are in Phase 2 studies. The QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant platform is partnered with GlaxoSmithKline and Janssen. Several of those collaborations involve Phase 3 trials. Altogether, the company and its partners are sponsoring approximately 20 clinical trials of Agenus products.
Key Partners and Deals[edit]
Merck: April 2014, Agenus announced a deal worth potentially $100 million with Merck. The deal involves the discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies to two undisclosed Merck checkpoint targets, both thought to be relevant for cancer treatment. Agenus will use its proprietary Retrocyte Display® platform to discover and optimize antibodies against the targets.
4-Antibody: February 2014, Agenus acquired European biotechnology firm 4-Antibody, along with its Retrocyte Display technology and a portfolio of checkpoint modulator antibody candidates .
Ludwig Cancer Research: 4-Antibody had been working on the checkpoint targets for several years in collaboration with Ludwig Cancer Research, one of the world’s most renowned institutions for research into cancer and the immune system. The leader of the Ludwig collaborative laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Jedd Wolchok, is recognized as one of immuno-oncology’s leading pioneers.
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK): March 2012, GSK paid Agenus $9 million to include additional rights to the two firms’ agreement around Agenus’ QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant. The deal amended license and manufacturing terms. It also included royalty payments to Agenus for an undisclosed indication upon commercialization of a vaccine.
Product Descriptions[edit]
Checkpoint Modulators (CPMs) interfere with cancers’ ability to “hijack” natural immune defense systems. To protect the body against disease, but without attacking healthy cells, the immune system uses multiple “checkpoint” systems. Some checkpoints stimulate immune responses while others inhibit them. Cancer cells can evolve means to evade checkpoints, and CPMs can reverse that effect, helping the immune system better fight the cancer.
Agenus currently has programs targeting the checkpoint modulators GITR, OX40, CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3 and PD-1. The company is expanding that portfolio by using its proprietary Retrocyte Display® discovery system to generate fully human therapeutic antibody drug candidates. The platform is a high-throughput approach incorporating IgG format human antibody libraries expressed in mammalian B-lineage cells.
The Prophage Series of patient-specific cancer vaccine candidates can also enhance the immune system’s response to tumors. Because each cancer is unique, the vaccine is derived from the patient’s own tumor sample. To process these samples, Agenus has established a multi-product Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility, which has already helped process over 1,000 tumor samples from across the globe.
The company's QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant platform strengthens and broadens immune responses to antigens on cancers or foreign invaders’ surfaces. Agenus has multiple partnerships around this product to study its effects with vaccines for diseases including Alzheimer’s, melanoma, and malaria. In October 2013, GlaxoSmithKline and Agenus announced positive data from an 18-month follow-up of GSK’s RTS,S malaria vaccine with QS21-Stimulon. GSK stated that the treatment was working well enough to support a regulatory filing. RTS,S is the most advanced vaccine for malaria in development.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
