NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on the Bank of America Merrill

      pass-through certificates. Fitch expects to rate the transaction and 
      assign Rating Outlooks as follows:
    

      --$31,300,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$135,900,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49,500,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$613,382,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$89,816,000b class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$51,480,000ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,906,000ab class X-E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10,954,000ab class X-F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51,480,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,906,000a class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10,954,000a class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of May 16, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the following classes:
    

      --$18,620,000ab class X-G;
    

      --$25,193,056ab class X-H;
    

      --$18,620,000a class G;
    

      --$25,193,056a class H.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 52 loans secured by 84 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $876.3 
      million as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by UBS Real Estate Securities Inc., Barclays Bank PLC, Morgan Stanley 
      Mortgage Capital Holdings, LLC, and Bank of America, National 
      Association.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral 
      including site inspections on 79.6% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 84.8%, and asset summary reviews on 100.0% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Higher Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage statistics 
      than other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The Fitch debt service 
      coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) are 1.14x and 108.2%, 
      respectively. This is worse than for other Fitch-rated fixed-rate 
      multiborrower transactions; the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 average Fitch 
      DSCR is 1.17x and the YTD 2016 average Fitch LTV is 107.9%.
    

      High Concentration of Pari Passu Loans: Twelve loans representing 45.1% 
      of the pool by balance are pari passu loans. Ten of the pari passu loans 
      (35.5% of the pool) have their controlling notes securitized in other 
      transactions. Two loans, In-Rel 8 (6.8% of the pool) and Grove City 
      Premium Outlets (2.7% of the pool) have their controlling notes 
      securitized in this transaction.
    

      Less Concentrated Pool: The top 10 loans make up 51.5% of the pool, 
      which is below the YTD 2016 average of 54.8% for other Fitch-rated 
      fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's Loan Concentration 
      Index (LCI) is 359 is below the YTD 2016 average of 415.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 15.2% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI) for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period. Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF 
      could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans 
      and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to BACM 
      2016-UBS10 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10-11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on the analysis.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

All trends are Stable.

The rating confirmations reflect the overall stable performance of the transaction, which has remained in line with DBRS�s expectations since issuance. The transaction consists of 52 loans secured by 84 commercial properties. As of the May 2017 remittance report, the trust balance was $872.0 million, representing collateral reduction of 0.5% from issuance as a result of scheduled amortization with all original loans remaining in the pool. 

As of the May 2017 remittance report, loans representing 91.7% of the pool are reporting YE2016 figures with a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.63 times (x) and a WA debt yield of 10.0%. These figures compare with the DBRS issuance WA DSCR and DBRS issuance WA debt yield of 1.45x and 8.9%, respectively, for those loans. In addition, the top 15 loans reporting YE2016 net cash flow (NCF) figures showed WA NCF growth of 16.3% over the DBRS issuance NCF figures with a WA DSCR of 1.70x compared with the WA DBRS issuance DSCR of 1.46x. As of the April 2017 remittance report, there are no loans on the watchlist or in special servicing. 

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted loans as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool in the DBRS CMBS IReports platform. Registration is free.
