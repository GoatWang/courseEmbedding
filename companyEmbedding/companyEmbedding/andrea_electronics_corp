Patented Direction Finding and Tracking Array (DFTA™) technology utilizes an array of microphones and a unique algorithm to detect the presence of a user’s voice, determine the direction of the voice and follow and track it when it moves. In a videoconferencing setting, this unique technology can provide direction to a videoconferencing camera and allow the system to steer and concentrate on the speaker, thus providing a “video-follow-audio” capability.

Stereo recording with the SuperBeam headset enables lifelike 3D surround sound capture of the users listening environment. Due to the stereo microphones “Binaural” placement near the user’s ears, creates a natural head acoustic transfer function. Sound arriving at each microphone in different phase will duplicate the real ear listening experience. Audio playback of these recordings will then deliver a realistic sound reproduction experience, great for recording live audio events.

History and products[edit]
It was founded as Andrea Radio Corporation in 1934[where?] by Frank A. D. Andrea Sr.
In the early 1950s, the company was among the very first elite U.S. television manufacturers including what was referred to as the Cadillac of televisions at the World's Fair.
In the 1960s, the company designed the capsule's intercom communication system used in the first manned Mercury space flight and military intercoms for F16 fighter jets and helicopters.
In 1998, the company pioneered microphone array technology, which has become a standard for hands-free VoIP communication embedding its advanced noise-cancellation technology into millions of computers being produced by global manufacturers, including Dell and Hewlett-Packard.[1]
In more recent years, it began manufacturing its own brand of headsets known as SuperBeam headsets. The company has created boom-free, all-purpose headsets essentially applying its microphone array technology to the headset industry as well as beam forming which is utilized to eliminate background noise.[2]
SuperBeam headsets[edit]
After 75 years of predominantly working with NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense as well as doing OEM work for several companies, the company decided to create its own headset line. These headsets are multipurpose as they handle gaming, VoIP, music and recording. The headsets employ dual mics which allow for binaural recording.

Andrea Communications 3D Surround Sound Recording Phones 


                        The Andrea SuperBeam headset records the user's listening environment in 3D surround sound with the placement of Binaural Stereo Microphones on each ear piece of the headphone., The close proximity of the SuperBeam microphones to the user's left and right ears create an acoustic "Real Head                        
                             Transfer Function" effect. Sound arriving at each microphone in natural phase will duplicate ones' own live listening experience.

Great for recording live music, live audio events, live entertainment, lectures or environmental soundscapes., Simply put the head-set on and plug into your compatible stereo recording device. The headset provides standard 3.5mm audio plugs, one for the microphones and the other for the headphone connections. This enables you to listen to music through the headphone while using the binaural mics with your video camera., For use with: Go Pro Hero3 (w/Mic adapter cable), DSLR cameras, camcorders, digital field recorders, Mac and PC computers, or any recording device with external 3.5mm bias powered stereo Mic input.,

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
