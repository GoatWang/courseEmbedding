Its products include petrochemicals, natural gas, liquid gas, sulphur, gasoline, kerosene and diesel. According to the company, Pemex operates 454 production fields; more than 9,000 production wells; 254 offshore platforms; six refineries; eight petrochemical complexes; over 7,000km of gas pipelines; more than 4,700km of oil pipelines; and 19 LPG distribution terminals. It also operates more than 10,400 service stations throughout the country. As a result of Mexico's energy reforms, Pemex restructured its operations and formed new subsidiaries. Four of the company's units were transformed into two productive subsidiaries: an E&P unit (formerly Pemex Exploración y Producción) and an industrial transformation unit (formerly Pemex Petroquímica, Pemex Gas y Petroquímica Básica, and Pemex Refinación). In addition, five non-core subsidiaries were also approved to cover the segments of drilling and services, logistics, cogeneration and services, and fertilizers and ethylene. The company was founded in 1938 and is based in Mexico City, Mexico.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

Contenido de la páginaAt the installation session of the Board of Directors of the new Productive State-owned Subsidiary (PSS) Pemex Drilling and Services (Pemex Perforación y Servicios), the organic statute containing its organization and functions was approved, and it will come into force once it is published in the Official Gazette of the Federation.
 
This is an important step in the approval process of new Productive State-owned subsidiaries of Pemex, which were established as business lines with the purpose of generating economic value.
 
In previous days, the Board of Directors of Petróleos Mexicanos approved the appointment of José Serrano Lozano as CEO of Pemex Drilling and Services, a company that will provide services for drilling, completion, repair and well services complying with quality, time, cost, safety, health and environmental protection standards.
 
For its part, the Board of Pemex Drilling and Services approved the appointments of the heads of the areas of the new PSS: José Gilberto Silva Garcia as Deputy Director of Operations and Interventions to Wells, and Pedro Virgilio Sánchez Soto as Deputy Director of Wells Engineering and Business Development.
 
In this regard, and with the consolidation of the Energy Reform, we have identified great potential for activities that require the services of the new company both in Pemex Exploration and Production as in the operators that undertake activities in the country.
 
Pemex Drilling and Services’ projects are part of Petróleos Mexicanos’ business strategy of creating value and profitability.  The company faces the challenge to improve its operations and provide quality services, as it is designed to be a major competitor in the industry, with both a national and international perspective, and being evaluated primarily on the basis of its financial results.

Pemex to start drilling Maximinio deepwater oil well in March: upstream head



Mexico City (Platts)--28 Feb 2012 437 pm EST/2137 GMT




Mexico's Pemex will drill the long-awaited Maximinio oil well next month
in Gulf of Mexico waters of some 3,000 meters, the deepest ever probed by
that state company, Carlos Morales, director-general of its upstream
subsidiary, said Tuesday.     Maximinio will be drilled in the Perdido Fold Belt, about 30 kilometers
south of the maritime border with the United States. Perdido has long been
regarded by Pemex as the top target of its deepwater drilling program. This
could also be an indictor of oil and gas potential along the maritime border
under the bilateral treaty with the US signed earlier this month. The treaty
provides for unitization of any oil and gas deposits that might be found.     Since 2004, Pemex has drilled 19 deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
So far seven have struck oil and two natural gas, while results are awaited
on four.

    At a press conference Tuesday on fourth-quarter Pemex results, Morales
sought to quell fears about the potential for a spill at Maximinio given
Pemex's relative lack of experience in such deep waters.     Juan Carlos Zepeda, president of Mexico's upstream regulator, the
National Hydrocarbons Commission, is among those who have voiced concern. But
Morales said Tuesday that an agreement between the "spills experts" of Hellix
Well Containment and Pemex should allay an lingering fears.     Maximinio is to be drilled by the semi-submersible Bicentenario rig.
Originally, it was to have drilled Maximinio more than a year ago, but was
moved to a less challenging target in the southern Gulf of Mexico in what
Pemex described as an effort to acquire experience.     Pemex said it recorded a net loss of 23.8 billion Mexican pesos ($1.7
billion) in the fourth quarter of last year compared with 23.5 billion
Mexican pesos in the same period of 2010.     As is usual for Pemex, the net loss in last year's fourth quarter was
weighed down by a $17.4 billion tax bill that swallowed up 58% of revenue.
Currency losses of $2.3 billion were also caused by a decline in the value of
the Mexican peso against the US dollar.--Ronald Buchanan, newsdesk@platts.com

Case Study: Field Studies Guide PEMEX Burgos Basin Natural Gas Drilling Project
Integrated services cut completion time by 40%
Challenge: PEMEX wanted to enhance operating resources and capabilities by using Schlumberger Integrated Project Management (IPM) to increase gas production from the Burgos basin of northern Mexico.Solution: IPM provided rig provision and management; well drilling; directional drilling; drilling fluids; cementing; logging; completion and stimulation; production enhancement and logistics; and civil works.Result: Schlumberger delivered 375 wells over 5 contracts. Well completion times were reduced by 40%. Wells were efficiently stimulated using the PowerSTIM well optimization service, increasing productivity by 5% to 10% per well. New drilling opportunities were identified and a better understanding of reservoir structure and stratigraphy was developed.
Increasing gas production
In January 1994, a PEMEX task force developed a new approach for significantly increasing gas production from the Burgos basin of northern Mexico. PEMEX wanted to enhance operating resources and capabilities by using integrated service companies to meet the high demand for natural gas in industry and power generation in Mexico. PEMEX contracted with the IPM team in 1997 on the first integrated project. The project plan called for the IPM team to acquire 3D seismic data on 250 mi2, perform 2 integrated reservoir studies, drill 31 wells, and construct a gas-gathering station and 4 gas compression plants. The IPM team completed the work in 11 months. 
Integrating services and full project management
The relationship and trust between PEMEX and IPM have grown since that first project, as has the scope of IPM responsibilities: from providing integrated services to full project management-planning through implementation. IPM is currently undertaking the fifth major integrated project contract in the Burgos basin. 
In the latest contract, IPM will provide all engineering, project management and related services to bring 310 wells on line. IPM responsibilities will include designing the drilling programs; providing and managing rigs; and supervising and performing completion, perforating, fracturing, and well-testing operations. In addition, the IPM team will develop all engineering plans for production enhancement, and manage and execute wellsite supervision, directional drilling, data collection, drilling fluids selection, and flowline installation. The IPM team will also supervise and manage all logistics, waste management, and construction of access ways and wellsites. 
From January 2003 to January 2004, IPM completed 72 wells, performed 93 fracture jobs, and tested 122 intervals with a collective initial production rate of 5.35 million m3/d [189 MMcf/d]. 
In January 1994, a PEMEX task force developed a new approach for significantly increasing gas production from the Burgos basin of northern Mexico. PEMEX wanted to enhance operating resources and capabilities by using integrated service companies to meet the high demand for natural gas in industry and power generation in Mexico.

Turbodrilling Deviated Interval Saves PEMEX 96 Hours













Case Study: Turbodrilling Deviated Interval Saves PEMEX 96 Hours
Steerable turbodrill and 8 1/2-in diamond-impregnated bits reduce number of runs while drilling abrasive formation onshore Mexico
Challenge: Reduce number of days, runs, and bits required to drill 8 1/2-in interval in Cretaceous formation with high percentage of abrasive chert nodules.Solution: Use 6 5/8-in Neyrfor turbodrilling system with 8 1/2-in Kinetic diamond-impregnated bits.Result: Drilled to TD in less than 211 hours at an average ROP of nearly 7 ft/h.Saved 96 hours bringing well to production.
Drill through abrasive Cretaceous formation
PEMEX was drilling the 8 1/2-in intervals of onshore wells in the Terra field
near Villahermosa, Mexico, with positive displacement motors (PDMs) and
rock and PDC bits. Because the Cretaceous formation—which was mainly
compressible mudstone with up to 40% abrasive chert nodules—caused
rapid wear of BHA components, multiple runs and many days were required
to drill each interval. PEMEX wanted to reduce drilling time for the interval
and the number of bits used.
Introduce turbodrilling system with
diamond-impregnated bits in Mexico
The Schlumberger Integrated Project Management (IPM) team, working
with PEMEX, introduced the 6 5/8-in Neyrfor turbodrilling system with
8 1/2-in Kinetic diamond-impregnated bits from Smith Bits, a Schlumberger
company, in Mexico to replace the PDM system and rock bits. The
directional turbodrill was configured with two integral body stabilizers,
which were augmented with a string stabilizer.
During the first turbodrill run, the directional plan called for building angle,
and the a KHi913 hybrid Kinetic bit with PDC cutters were used. Later,
the turbodrill was run with a K503QTB Kinetic bit designed for superior
performance at high rotary speeds in tough, abrasive formations.
Saved 96 hours of drilling time
Using the Neyrfor turbodrill and customized Kinetic bits, the directional
driller successfully built angle to 28° and reached interval TD in less than
211 hours at an average ROP of nearly 7 ft/h. The time to drill to TD was
approximately 96 hours less than the time required to drill the interval in
offset wells with conventional drilling systems. Reducing the drilling time
enabled PEMEX to put the well into production sooner.

Offshore Drilling in The Gulf of Mexico: US and Pemex Activity
Feb 3, 2015 | International Energy Oil and Gas | 0 comments
 

When the Obama administration announced its new five-year leasing plans for US waters on January 27, the inclusion of a portion of the Atlantic garnered most of the headlines. However, arguably the bigger news was the decision to make Gulf of Mexico lease sales region wide. After all, any leasing let alone drilling off the coasts of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina or Georgia is on an if-come-maybe basis, facing many interim hurdles that put it years in the future at best. On the other hand, beginning in 2017 the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) will hold two Gulf of Mexico sales annually that will offer all open blocks in the Western and Central planning areas plus the blocks not under moratorium in the Eastern Gulf.
Pardon the pun, but this is a sea change. Since the first five-year plan was launched in 1980, Gulf of Mexico leases sales have been divided into Western Gulf and Central Gulf offerings, with a lease sale for the more heavily protected and therefore lightly explored Eastern Gulf thrown in every so often for good measure. With the exception of the year-and-a-half disruption brought about by the Macondo disaster in 2010, Central Gulf sales were generally held in the spring, followed by a Western Sale late in the summer.
More offshore drilling opportunities
So what spurred the change? In a word, Mexico. The decision to offer all open blocks in one sale was made in light of energy reforms that are opening up licensing opportunities in Mexican waters. Acknowledging that resources no doubt straddle both sides of the US-Mexico Maritime boundary, the BOEM decided to offer more frequent opportunities to bid on open Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) blocks to facilitate cross-border exploration.
“This new approach will allow for BOEM to more effectively balance the sales while providing greater flexibility to industry to invest in the Gulf, particularly given the significant energy reforms recently adopted by the Mexican government,” said BOEM Director Abigail Ross Hopper.
Mexico is finally poised to act
The opening of Mexico after three quarters of a century is the single largest event on the international E&P horizon today, even in the face of collapsing crude oil prices. Ironically, Mexico closed and locked its doors at precisely the same time the first offshore oil well was completed. Drilled from a freestanding platform a mile and a half from the Louisiana coastline, as opposed to over-water drilling conducted earlier in the decade by barges in the Louisiana marshes, the Gulf of Mexico State Lease No. 1 began producing in March 1938, opening the Creole field.

Today the US Gulf of Mexico is one of the world’s premier oil and gas producing provinces, which of course has not escaped Mexico’s attention. It is no coincidence that the three light oil fields found to date in Mexico’s deep waters – Exploratus, Trion and Maximino – are clustered on the Perdido Foldbelt, within 50 miles south of Shell’s Perdido Development, which includes the Great White, Tobago and Trident fields. When Perdido began producing oil in 2010, it was hailed as a “technological tour de force” for being so far out (200 miles south of Houston) and so deep (in about 8,000 feet of water).
Mexico’s national oil company Pemex is looking for partners in these three fields in what is known as Round 0.5. These Lower Tertiary light oil fields are big prizes, with reserves estimated between 150-200 MMbo at Trion to as much as 500 MMbo at Exploratus. Up to 75% of Trion and Exploratus are said to be available, as well as operatorship of Exploratus. In addition, Pemex may farm out equity in Maximino. While reserves estimates have yet to be released for Maximino, Pemex has called it the “jewel in the crown.” Needless to say, Shell and its partners on the US side of the border – BP and Chevron – are all said to be interested.
In addition to the opportunity to farm into these three discoveries, the Mexican government will hold a bid round this year that will include deepwater blocks. Tom Liskey, DrillingInfo’s Northern Latin American Manager, said the call for bids for the deepwater tranche of blocks in the staggered Round 1 process is expected to launch in March 2015, with registration and data rooms opening in May 2015. Awards for the deepwater sector should begin in October 2015.
The US is not standing idle

Meanwhile on the US side, another oil field far from shore in very deep water came onstream on January 15. Anadarko’s Lucius field, located about 240 miles south of the Louisiana coastline, is anchored by an 80,000 bo/d spar and producing via 100 miles of new oil pipeline and 230 miles of gas pipeline. Located in the Keathley Canyon area, Lucius is about 30 miles north of the Mexican boundary. Some 175 miles due east of Perdido, this portion of the Lower Tertiary Trend is very active and in 2013 Anadarko made another big discovery about 10 miles south of Lucius. That discovery, known as Phobos, is the first well drilled in the Sigsbee Escarpment. First oil at Lucius came only a month after Chevron began production at Jack/St. Malo to the east in the Walker Ridge area. In another recent development, Chevron, BP and ConocoPhillips on January 29 announced they will jointly develop several large oil discoveries – Gila, Guadalupe and Tiber – in the northwestern Keathley Canyon area.
All of this activity underlines the synergy that will be needed to exploit resources in Mexican waters. In addition to drilling and development on the US side, there are a number of seismic surveys currently underway that span both sides of the boundary, including two even further to the east in the undrilled Lund Protraction area.

Pemex launches Perdido drilling offensive at record water depths



Mexico City (Platts)--4 Jun 2012 1124 am EDT/1524 GMT




Spearheaded by three semi-submersible rigs on contracts of more than
$500,000 a day, Mexico's Pemex is launching a deepwater drilling offensive in
the Perdido Fold Belt that will lead it in about a year to waters of more
than 2,900 meters, according to a planning document of the state company.     The offensive forms part of a 2012-2016 deepwater plan that aims to
invest $5 billion in return for the discovery of 3.2 billion barrels of oil
equivalent of reserves, of which 60% will be crude and condensate. The number
of wells to be drilled is 31.     The document, obtained by Platts, indicates that the Maximino 1 well in
waters of 2,922 meters, the deepest ever drilled by Pemex, is likely to be
spudded in November of this year and concluded to a total depth of 6,640
meters by March of 2013.

   The location is about 30 miles of the maritime border with the US. It
will be drilled by the West Pegasus semi-submersible, hired by an affiliate
of Norway's Seadrill.     The West Pegasus should already have begun drilling the Supremus 1, only
days ago, in waters of 2,900 meters in Perdido, according to sources at
Pemex. It is scheduled to be drilled to a total depth of 4,000 meters, and is
expected to be concluded just before the rig moves on to Maximino.     Meanwhile, in waters of 2,917 meters, the PEP 1 well is to be drilled in
Perdido from January 2013 and is scheduled to be concluded by July of the
same year at a total depth of 7,200 meters. PEP 1 is to be drilled by the
Bicentenario semi-submersible owned by a Mexican partnership of Grupo R and
Industrial Perforadora de Campeche.     The offensive in Perdido was originally to have been launched more than
a year ago but was delayed by the arrivals of the semi-submersibles and by
regulatory concerns in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon accident.     By the end of the year, the Bicentenario will drill the Trion 1 well to
explore the potential of sub-salt plays in the Salina del Bravo region, west
of Perdido. Trion is to the the first of four exploratory wells that Pemex
aims to evaluate Salina de Bravo.     Supremus, Maximino, Trion and PEP are all rated by Pemex to have
potential for production of light crude.     The 19 deepwater wells drilled by Pemex over the last eight years has
yet to prove any commercial discoveries of oil, and only one of natural gas,
Lakach, in the southern Gulf.      "But the commercial viability of Lakach is questionable, given the
recent reduction in gas prices," says Luis Miguel Labardini, partner of the
Marcos y Asociados consultancy, based in Mexico City.     Meanwhile, Pemex is planning to launch production from Lakach in 2015,
rising to 400,000 Mcf/d the following year. Lakach is located in the Catemaco
Fold Belt, in the southernmost part of the Gulf.     Six development and recovery wells are to be drilled in Lakach, along
with two pipelines and a gas conditioning center.     Pemex is also drilling four wells, expected to be producers of natural
gas in the Catemaco Fold belt and the Salina del Istmo sub-salt region, from
now through the middle of next year.--Ronald Buchanan, newsdesk@platts.com
