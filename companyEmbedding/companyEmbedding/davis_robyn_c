Education
Products without proper training are of limited value. We specialize in evaluating your facility's needs and designing cleaning programs to match your expectations. Online training programs such as Spartan's "Clean Check" help elevate building maintenance programs and satisfy continuing education requirements.  We supplement these classroom sessions with hands-on training at your facility to build employee confidence and deliver results. Whether the subject is floor care, restroom sanitation, green cleaning, fire and safety programs, or a host of other related topics, you can expect honest and accurate advice from our staff.

Welcome to Davis Products

Full Line of Janitorial Supplies, Paper and Disposables, Cleaning Equipment, and Fire and Safety Products.


Paper and Disposable Products 
    

In 1959 Dick Weintritt purchased Davis Products Co in Bogalusa. At the time,  it was a lawn mower repair shop that went to New Orleans weekly to pick up presold brooms and mops for local customers.  I-10 in the New Orleans area was under construction and Causeway Boulevard on the Northshore was a two lane road with dirt shoulders.
Fifty four years later Davis Products is in its second generation of leadership and has diversified geographically, as well as in its product offering.
We continue to be the only Northshore supplier to address all aspects of the facility maintenance and janitorial supply industry. Whether you need housekeeping or building maintenance items, janitorial or laundry products, food service or ware wash, cleaning equipment or fire extinguishers, or any combination of the above, you can rely on us to provide the products, procedures and training necessary to accomplish your goals.
Through strategic partnerships with our key suppliers we will design and implement effective strategies that cover a multitude of areas, keeping your facility clean, safe and healthy from the restroom to the boardroom, and beyond.
Thank you for visiting our website. For a glimpse into what we have to offer, please check out our site or e-mail us at customerservice@davisproductsco.com. For an immediate response please call us at 1-800-548-1995 (La and Miss Toll Free) or 985 732 2783.
Regards,
Charles S Weintritt
       	    President

Faculty 




Robyn Rodriguez
Globalization, Immigration/Migration, Diaspora/Transnationalism, Citizenship, Social Movements and Activism.
 The daughter of Filipino immigrants, Robyn Magalit Rodriguez grew up Union City, California. She attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she majored in sociology and took classes in Asian American Studies. Professor Rodriguez then went on to earn her PhD in Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley.
Professor Rodriguez’s research is broadly concerned with understanding how processes of globalization, particularly international migration, impact the societies that migrants leave and the societies to which they move.  Her book, Migrants for Export: How the Philippines Brokers Labor to the World (University of Minnesota Press, 2010), won an Honorable Mention for Best Book in Social Science by the Association for Asian American Studies. Professor Rodriguez's co-authored book, Asian America: Sociological and Interdisciplinary Approaches will be published by Polity Press in 2014. Currently, she is finishing a book entitled In Lady Liberty's Shadow: Race and Immigration in Post-9/11 New Jersey to be published by Rutgers University Press in 2015.
Rodriguez’s background in Asian American studies informs her actions as an activist. Asian American studies emerged out of student movements that raised questions about access to institutions of higher learning and the politics of knowledge production. These movements, moreover, demanded education and scholarship that was relevant to communities that have been long left out of the university. Professor Rodriguez is very much inspired by that tradition. She uses the skills she has developed as a researcher to contribute to communities and is currently working closely on different projects with the National Alliance for Filipino Concerns.
