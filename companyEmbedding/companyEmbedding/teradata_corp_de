Teradata Corporation is a provider of database-related products and services. The company was formed in 1979 in Brentwood, California, as a collaboration between researchers at Caltech and Citibank's advanced technology group.[2] The company was acquired by NCR Corporation in 1991, and subsequently spun-off again as an independent public company on October 1, 2007.
The company produces a relational database management system of the same name, which it markets as a data warehouse. It also acquired new technologies by making many acquisitions. In 2015, after continued losses, the company announced a business transformation review, which led to divestitures and replacement of executives.[3] Teradata employed 10,093 at the end of 2016, and had corporate headquarters Dayton, Ohio.[1]

Corporate overview[edit]
Teradata is an enterprise software company that develops and sells a relational database management system (RDBMS) with the same name. Teradata is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the stock symbol TDC.[4]
The flagship Teradata product is referred to as a "data warehouse system" which stores and manages data. The data warehouses use a "shared nothing architecture", which means that each server node has its own memory and processing power.[5] Adding more servers and nodes increases the amount of data that can be stored. The database software runs on the servers and spreads the workload among them.[6] In 2010, Teradata added text analytics to track unstructured data, such as word processor documents, and semi-structured data, such as spreadsheets.[7]
Teradata has a supplier diversity program that designates a minimum of 3 to 5% of spending on minority, women, veteran, or small business vendors.[8] In 2013, the Ethisphere Institute named Teradata as one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies."[9]
Teradata holds an annual user group conference and expo known as Teradata Partners with keynote industry speakers, educational sessions led by customers and other vendors.[10] The Teradata Partners Conference has been an annual event since 1985.[11] The conference involves lectures and speeches on technical and business topics and announcements about new products.[12]
History[edit]




NCR Teradata Worldmark 5100 in 2002


The concept of Teradata grew from research at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and from the discussions of Citibank's advanced technology group in the 1970s.[13] The company was incorporated in 1979 in Brentwood, California by Jack E. Shemer, Philip M. Neches, Walter E. Muir, Jerold R. Modes, William P. Worth, Carroll Reed and David Hartke. In 1984 Teradata released its DBC/1012 specialized database computer.[14] [15] In 1990 it acquired Sharebase, originally named Britton Lee.[16]
In September 1991 AT&T Corporation acquired NCR Corporation,[17] which in December announced the acquisition of Teradata for about $250 million. Kenneth W. Simonds had been chief executive since 1986.[18] In 1992 Teradata built the first system over 1 terabyte, at Wal-Mart.[19] A Teradata database became the world's largest at 11 terabytes in 1992. By 1997 NCR became independent from AT&T.[17]
In 1999 NCR acquired Strategic Technologies & Systems, and appointed Stephen Brobst as chief technology officer of the Teradata Solutions Group. In April 2000 NCR acquired Ceres Integrated Solutions and its customer relationship management software for $90 million,[20] and in July Stirling Douglas Group and its demand chain management software.[21] In 2005, it acquired financial management software from DecisionPoint.[22]
In January 2007 NCR announced Teradata would become an independent public company, led by Michael F. Koehler.[23][24] The new company's shares started trading in October.[4] In March 2008 Teradata acquired professional services company Claraview, which previously had spun out software provider Clarabridge.[25]
In August 2010, Teradata acquired column-oriented DBMS vendor Kickfire.[26][27] In December it acquired marketing software company Aprimo for about $550 million.[28][29] In March 2011 it acquired Aster Data Systems for about $263 million.[30][31] In May 2012 Teradata acquired email direct marketing company eCircle, which was merged into the Aprimo business.[32]
In July, 2014, Teradata acquired the assets of Revelytix, a provider of information management products and for a reported $50 million, Hadapt, a company that developed the database management system Presto for Apache Hadoop,[33][34][35] and in September, Hadoop service firm Think Big Analytics.[36] In December, Teradata acquired RainStor, a company specializing in online data archiving on Hadoop.[37]
In January 2015 Teradata acquired Appoxxee, a mobile marketing software as a service provider, for about $20 million.[38] In September Teradata acquired digital marketing company FLXone, based in the Netherlands.[39] In November 2015, after continued losses and declining revenue, a business transformation review was announced.[3] The company terminated "co-president" Herman Wimmer in December 2015, although it later had to pay more than 4.2 million Euros and a company car as severance.[40]
In April, 2016, a product line called IntelliFlex was announced.[41] On May 5, 2016 Victor L. Lund, who had been an executive of American Stores from 1977 to 1999, became the chief executive.[42] In July 2016, the marketing applications division, using the Aprimo brand, was sold to private equity firm Marlin Equity Partners for about $90 million. This was hundreds of millions less than it paid making the acquisitions of several companies merged into the unit.[43][44] Marlin combined businesses of the former eCircle, Appoxee, and Ozone businesses with an email marketing company BlueHornet (that it had acquired in 2015), using the brand Mapp Digital in September 2016.[45]
On July 21, 2016, Teradata acquired Big Data Partnership, a service company based in the UK.[46]
Technology and products[edit]
See also: Teradata Geospatial, Teradata Warehouse Miner, and Teradata Parallel Transporter
Active enterprise data warehouse[edit]
Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse, often called Teradata Database, includes data management tools and data mining software. Teradata's product can be used for business analysis. Data warehouses can track company data, such as sales, customer preferences, product placement, etc.[6] The data warehouse differentiates between “hot and cold” data – meaning that the warehouse puts data that is not often used in a slower storage section.[47] The original system used a proprietary network technology called BYNet.[48]
Teradata Database 13.10 was announced in October 2010.[49][50] At the time, Teradata used Xeon 5600 processors for the server nodes.[51]
Teradata Database 14 was sold as the upgrade to 13.10 in 2011 and runs multiple data warehouse workloads at the same time.[52] It includes column-store analyses.[53]
Teradata Integrated Analytics[54] is a set of tools for data analysis that resides inside the data warehouse.[55]
Teradata Warehouse Miner provides and interface for data mining on Microsoft Windows. It was released before 2003.[56]
Aster Platform[edit]
The Aster Platform is Teradata's analytic technology, acquired from Aster Data Systems.[57]
Backup, archive, and restore[edit]
BAR is Teradata’s backup and recovery system.[58]
The Teradata Disaster Recovery Solution is automation and tools for data recovery and archiving. Customer data can be stored in an offsite recovery center.[59]
QueryGrid[edit]
The Teradata database includes a feature called QueryGrid, [60] that allows user of the Teradata database to fetch data from external databases from standard SQL queries, as if they were hosted in the local EDW. The data movement happens in parallel whenever possible, so it is as efficient as performance the external data source; this is usually still much slower than native Teradata database performance, but still acceptable for exploratory tasks. External data sources are Aster, Presto, Teradata, Hive and Oracle.
Platform family[edit]
Teradata Platform Family is a set of products that include the Teradata Data Warehouse, Database, and a set of analytic tools. The platform family is marketed as smaller and less expensive than the other Teradata products.[61]
Big data[edit]
Teradata began to market with the term “big data” in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to “new media sources, such as social media.”[62] The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the “Petabyte club” in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.[63]
The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology.[64] For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company’s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.[65]
Competition[edit]
Teradata's main competitors are similar products from vendors such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and Sybase IQ. Also, competitors include data warehouse appliance vendors such as Netezza[66] (acquired in November 2010 by IBM), DATAllegro (acquired in August 2008 by Microsoft), ParAccel (acquired in April 2013 by Actian in April 2013), Pivotal Greenplum Database (acquired in July 2010 by EMC Corporation in July 2010), and Vertica Systems (acquired in February 2011 by HP), and from packaged data warehouse applications such as SAP BW.
Teradata has also seen competition from Hadoop-based distributions and other open source technologies.

Teradata Corporation is a provider of database-related products and services. The company was formed in 1979 in Brentwood, California, as a collaboration between researchers at Caltech and Citibank's advanced technology group.[2] The company was acquired by NCR Corporation in 1991, and subsequently spun-off again as an independent public company on October 1, 2007.
The company produces a relational database management system of the same name, which it markets as a data warehouse. It also acquired new technologies by making many acquisitions. In 2015, after continued losses, the company announced a business transformation review, which led to divestitures and replacement of executives.[3] Teradata employed 10,093 at the end of 2016, and had corporate headquarters Dayton, Ohio.[1]

Corporate overview[edit]
Teradata is an enterprise software company that develops and sells a relational database management system (RDBMS) with the same name. Teradata is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the stock symbol TDC.[4]
The flagship Teradata product is referred to as a "data warehouse system" which stores and manages data. The data warehouses use a "shared nothing architecture", which means that each server node has its own memory and processing power.[5] Adding more servers and nodes increases the amount of data that can be stored. The database software runs on the servers and spreads the workload among them.[6] In 2010, Teradata added text analytics to track unstructured data, such as word processor documents, and semi-structured data, such as spreadsheets.[7]
Teradata has a supplier diversity program that designates a minimum of 3 to 5% of spending on minority, women, veteran, or small business vendors.[8] In 2013, the Ethisphere Institute named Teradata as one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies."[9]
Teradata holds an annual user group conference and expo known as Teradata Partners with keynote industry speakers, educational sessions led by customers and other vendors.[10] The Teradata Partners Conference has been an annual event since 1985.[11] The conference involves lectures and speeches on technical and business topics and announcements about new products.[12]
History[edit]




NCR Teradata Worldmark 5100 in 2002


The concept of Teradata grew from research at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and from the discussions of Citibank's advanced technology group in the 1970s.[13] The company was incorporated in 1979 in Brentwood, California by Jack E. Shemer, Philip M. Neches, Walter E. Muir, Jerold R. Modes, William P. Worth, Carroll Reed and David Hartke. In 1984 Teradata released its DBC/1012 specialized database computer.[14] [15] In 1990 it acquired Sharebase, originally named Britton Lee.[16]
In September 1991 AT&T Corporation acquired NCR Corporation,[17] which in December announced the acquisition of Teradata for about $250 million. Kenneth W. Simonds had been chief executive since 1986.[18] In 1992 Teradata built the first system over 1 terabyte, at Wal-Mart.[19] A Teradata database became the world's largest at 11 terabytes in 1992. By 1997 NCR became independent from AT&T.[17]
In 1999 NCR acquired Strategic Technologies & Systems, and appointed Stephen Brobst as chief technology officer of the Teradata Solutions Group. In April 2000 NCR acquired Ceres Integrated Solutions and its customer relationship management software for $90 million,[20] and in July Stirling Douglas Group and its demand chain management software.[21] In 2005, it acquired financial management software from DecisionPoint.[22]
In January 2007 NCR announced Teradata would become an independent public company, led by Michael F. Koehler.[23][24] The new company's shares started trading in October.[4] In March 2008 Teradata acquired professional services company Claraview, which previously had spun out software provider Clarabridge.[25]
In August 2010, Teradata acquired column-oriented DBMS vendor Kickfire.[26][27] In December it acquired marketing software company Aprimo for about $550 million.[28][29] In March 2011 it acquired Aster Data Systems for about $263 million.[30][31] In May 2012 Teradata acquired email direct marketing company eCircle, which was merged into the Aprimo business.[32]
In July, 2014, Teradata acquired the assets of Revelytix, a provider of information management products and for a reported $50 million, Hadapt, a company that developed the database management system Presto for Apache Hadoop,[33][34][35] and in September, Hadoop service firm Think Big Analytics.[36] In December, Teradata acquired RainStor, a company specializing in online data archiving on Hadoop.[37]
In January 2015 Teradata acquired Appoxxee, a mobile marketing software as a service provider, for about $20 million.[38] In September Teradata acquired digital marketing company FLXone, based in the Netherlands.[39] In November 2015, after continued losses and declining revenue, a business transformation review was announced.[3] The company terminated "co-president" Herman Wimmer in December 2015, although it later had to pay more than 4.2 million Euros and a company car as severance.[40]
In April, 2016, a product line called IntelliFlex was announced.[41] On May 5, 2016 Victor L. Lund, who had been an executive of American Stores from 1977 to 1999, became the chief executive.[42] In July 2016, the marketing applications division, using the Aprimo brand, was sold to private equity firm Marlin Equity Partners for about $90 million. This was hundreds of millions less than it paid making the acquisitions of several companies merged into the unit.[43][44] Marlin combined businesses of the former eCircle, Appoxee, and Ozone businesses with an email marketing company BlueHornet (that it had acquired in 2015), using the brand Mapp Digital in September 2016.[45]
On July 21, 2016, Teradata acquired Big Data Partnership, a service company based in the UK.[46]
Technology and products[edit]
See also: Teradata Geospatial, Teradata Warehouse Miner, and Teradata Parallel Transporter
Active enterprise data warehouse[edit]
Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse, often called Teradata Database, includes data management tools and data mining software. Teradata's product can be used for business analysis. Data warehouses can track company data, such as sales, customer preferences, product placement, etc.[6] The data warehouse differentiates between “hot and cold” data – meaning that the warehouse puts data that is not often used in a slower storage section.[47] The original system used a proprietary network technology called BYNet.[48]
Teradata Database 13.10 was announced in October 2010.[49][50] At the time, Teradata used Xeon 5600 processors for the server nodes.[51]
Teradata Database 14 was sold as the upgrade to 13.10 in 2011 and runs multiple data warehouse workloads at the same time.[52] It includes column-store analyses.[53]
Teradata Integrated Analytics[54] is a set of tools for data analysis that resides inside the data warehouse.[55]
Teradata Warehouse Miner provides and interface for data mining on Microsoft Windows. It was released before 2003.[56]
Aster Platform[edit]
The Aster Platform is Teradata's analytic technology, acquired from Aster Data Systems.[57]
Backup, archive, and restore[edit]
BAR is Teradata’s backup and recovery system.[58]
The Teradata Disaster Recovery Solution is automation and tools for data recovery and archiving. Customer data can be stored in an offsite recovery center.[59]
QueryGrid[edit]
The Teradata database includes a feature called QueryGrid, [60] that allows user of the Teradata database to fetch data from external databases from standard SQL queries, as if they were hosted in the local EDW. The data movement happens in parallel whenever possible, so it is as efficient as performance the external data source; this is usually still much slower than native Teradata database performance, but still acceptable for exploratory tasks. External data sources are Aster, Presto, Teradata, Hive and Oracle.
Platform family[edit]
Teradata Platform Family is a set of products that include the Teradata Data Warehouse, Database, and a set of analytic tools. The platform family is marketed as smaller and less expensive than the other Teradata products.[61]
Big data[edit]
Teradata began to market with the term “big data” in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to “new media sources, such as social media.”[62] The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the “Petabyte club” in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.[63]
The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology.[64] For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company’s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.[65]
Competition[edit]
Teradata's main competitors are similar products from vendors such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and Sybase IQ. Also, competitors include data warehouse appliance vendors such as Netezza[66] (acquired in November 2010 by IBM), DATAllegro (acquired in August 2008 by Microsoft), ParAccel (acquired in April 2013 by Actian in April 2013), Pivotal Greenplum Database (acquired in July 2010 by EMC Corporation in July 2010), and Vertica Systems (acquired in February 2011 by HP), and from packaged data warehouse applications such as SAP BW.
Teradata has also seen competition from Hadoop-based distributions and other open source technologies.

Teradata Corporation is a provider of database-related products and services. The company was formed in 1979 in Brentwood, California, as a collaboration between researchers at Caltech and Citibank's advanced technology group.[2] The company was acquired by NCR Corporation in 1991, and subsequently spun-off again as an independent public company on October 1, 2007.
The company produces a relational database management system of the same name, which it markets as a data warehouse. It also acquired new technologies by making many acquisitions. In 2015, after continued losses, the company announced a business transformation review, which led to divestitures and replacement of executives.[3] Teradata employed 10,093 at the end of 2016, and had corporate headquarters Dayton, Ohio.[1]

Corporate overview[edit]
Teradata is an enterprise software company that develops and sells a relational database management system (RDBMS) with the same name. Teradata is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the stock symbol TDC.[4]
The flagship Teradata product is referred to as a "data warehouse system" which stores and manages data. The data warehouses use a "shared nothing architecture", which means that each server node has its own memory and processing power.[5] Adding more servers and nodes increases the amount of data that can be stored. The database software runs on the servers and spreads the workload among them.[6] In 2010, Teradata added text analytics to track unstructured data, such as word processor documents, and semi-structured data, such as spreadsheets.[7]
Teradata has a supplier diversity program that designates a minimum of 3 to 5% of spending on minority, women, veteran, or small business vendors.[8] In 2013, the Ethisphere Institute named Teradata as one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies."[9]
Teradata holds an annual user group conference and expo known as Teradata Partners with keynote industry speakers, educational sessions led by customers and other vendors.[10] The Teradata Partners Conference has been an annual event since 1985.[11] The conference involves lectures and speeches on technical and business topics and announcements about new products.[12]
History[edit]




NCR Teradata Worldmark 5100 in 2002


The concept of Teradata grew from research at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and from the discussions of Citibank's advanced technology group in the 1970s.[13] The company was incorporated in 1979 in Brentwood, California by Jack E. Shemer, Philip M. Neches, Walter E. Muir, Jerold R. Modes, William P. Worth, Carroll Reed and David Hartke. In 1984 Teradata released its DBC/1012 specialized database computer.[14] [15] In 1990 it acquired Sharebase, originally named Britton Lee.[16]
In September 1991 AT&T Corporation acquired NCR Corporation,[17] which in December announced the acquisition of Teradata for about $250 million. Kenneth W. Simonds had been chief executive since 1986.[18] In 1992 Teradata built the first system over 1 terabyte, at Wal-Mart.[19] A Teradata database became the world's largest at 11 terabytes in 1992. By 1997 NCR became independent from AT&T.[17]
In 1999 NCR acquired Strategic Technologies & Systems, and appointed Stephen Brobst as chief technology officer of the Teradata Solutions Group. In April 2000 NCR acquired Ceres Integrated Solutions and its customer relationship management software for $90 million,[20] and in July Stirling Douglas Group and its demand chain management software.[21] In 2005, it acquired financial management software from DecisionPoint.[22]
In January 2007 NCR announced Teradata would become an independent public company, led by Michael F. Koehler.[23][24] The new company's shares started trading in October.[4] In March 2008 Teradata acquired professional services company Claraview, which previously had spun out software provider Clarabridge.[25]
In August 2010, Teradata acquired column-oriented DBMS vendor Kickfire.[26][27] In December it acquired marketing software company Aprimo for about $550 million.[28][29] In March 2011 it acquired Aster Data Systems for about $263 million.[30][31] In May 2012 Teradata acquired email direct marketing company eCircle, which was merged into the Aprimo business.[32]
In July, 2014, Teradata acquired the assets of Revelytix, a provider of information management products and for a reported $50 million, Hadapt, a company that developed the database management system Presto for Apache Hadoop,[33][34][35] and in September, Hadoop service firm Think Big Analytics.[36] In December, Teradata acquired RainStor, a company specializing in online data archiving on Hadoop.[37]
In January 2015 Teradata acquired Appoxxee, a mobile marketing software as a service provider, for about $20 million.[38] In September Teradata acquired digital marketing company FLXone, based in the Netherlands.[39] In November 2015, after continued losses and declining revenue, a business transformation review was announced.[3] The company terminated "co-president" Herman Wimmer in December 2015, although it later had to pay more than 4.2 million Euros and a company car as severance.[40]
In April, 2016, a product line called IntelliFlex was announced.[41] On May 5, 2016 Victor L. Lund, who had been an executive of American Stores from 1977 to 1999, became the chief executive.[42] In July 2016, the marketing applications division, using the Aprimo brand, was sold to private equity firm Marlin Equity Partners for about $90 million. This was hundreds of millions less than it paid making the acquisitions of several companies merged into the unit.[43][44] Marlin combined businesses of the former eCircle, Appoxee, and Ozone businesses with an email marketing company BlueHornet (that it had acquired in 2015), using the brand Mapp Digital in September 2016.[45]
On July 21, 2016, Teradata acquired Big Data Partnership, a service company based in the UK.[46]
Technology and products[edit]
See also: Teradata Geospatial, Teradata Warehouse Miner, and Teradata Parallel Transporter
Active enterprise data warehouse[edit]
Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse, often called Teradata Database, includes data management tools and data mining software. Teradata's product can be used for business analysis. Data warehouses can track company data, such as sales, customer preferences, product placement, etc.[6] The data warehouse differentiates between “hot and cold” data – meaning that the warehouse puts data that is not often used in a slower storage section.[47] The original system used a proprietary network technology called BYNet.[48]
Teradata Database 13.10 was announced in October 2010.[49][50] At the time, Teradata used Xeon 5600 processors for the server nodes.[51]
Teradata Database 14 was sold as the upgrade to 13.10 in 2011 and runs multiple data warehouse workloads at the same time.[52] It includes column-store analyses.[53]
Teradata Integrated Analytics[54] is a set of tools for data analysis that resides inside the data warehouse.[55]
Teradata Warehouse Miner provides and interface for data mining on Microsoft Windows. It was released before 2003.[56]
Aster Platform[edit]
The Aster Platform is Teradata's analytic technology, acquired from Aster Data Systems.[57]
Backup, archive, and restore[edit]
BAR is Teradata’s backup and recovery system.[58]
The Teradata Disaster Recovery Solution is automation and tools for data recovery and archiving. Customer data can be stored in an offsite recovery center.[59]
QueryGrid[edit]
The Teradata database includes a feature called QueryGrid, [60] that allows user of the Teradata database to fetch data from external databases from standard SQL queries, as if they were hosted in the local EDW. The data movement happens in parallel whenever possible, so it is as efficient as performance the external data source; this is usually still much slower than native Teradata database performance, but still acceptable for exploratory tasks. External data sources are Aster, Presto, Teradata, Hive and Oracle.
Platform family[edit]
Teradata Platform Family is a set of products that include the Teradata Data Warehouse, Database, and a set of analytic tools. The platform family is marketed as smaller and less expensive than the other Teradata products.[61]
Big data[edit]
Teradata began to market with the term “big data” in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to “new media sources, such as social media.”[62] The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the “Petabyte club” in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.[63]
The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology.[64] For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company’s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.[65]
Competition[edit]
Teradata's main competitors are similar products from vendors such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and Sybase IQ. Also, competitors include data warehouse appliance vendors such as Netezza[66] (acquired in November 2010 by IBM), DATAllegro (acquired in August 2008 by Microsoft), ParAccel (acquired in April 2013 by Actian in April 2013), Pivotal Greenplum Database (acquired in July 2010 by EMC Corporation in July 2010), and Vertica Systems (acquired in February 2011 by HP), and from packaged data warehouse applications such as SAP BW.
Teradata has also seen competition from Hadoop-based distributions and other open source technologies.

The database software runs on the servers and spreads the workload among them.[6] In 2010, Teradata added text analytics to track unstructured data, such as word processor documents, and semi-structured data, such as spreadsheets.[7]
Teradata has a supplier diversity program that designates a minimum of 3 to 5% of spending on minority, women, veteran, or small business vendors.[8] In 2013, the Ethisphere Institute named Teradata as one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies."[9]
Teradata holds an annual user group conference and expo known as Teradata Partners with keynote industry speakers, educational sessions led by customers and other vendors.[10] The Teradata Partners Conference has been an annual event since 1985.[11] The conference involves lectures and speeches on technical and business topics and announcements about new products.[12]
History[edit]




NCR Teradata Worldmark 5100 in 2002


The concept of Teradata grew from research at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and from the discussions of Citibank's advanced technology group in the 1970s.[13] The company was incorporated in 1979 in Brentwood, California by Jack E. Shemer, Philip M. Neches, Walter E. Muir, Jerold R. Modes, William P. Worth, Carroll Reed and David Hartke. In 1984 Teradata released its DBC/1012 specialized database computer.[14] [15] In 1990 it acquired Sharebase, originally named Britton Lee.[16]
In September 1991 AT&T Corporation acquired NCR Corporation,[17] which in December announced the acquisition of Teradata for about $250 million. Kenneth W. Simonds had been chief executive since 1986.[18] In 1992 Teradata built the first system over 1 terabyte, at Wal-Mart.[19] A Teradata database became the world's largest at 11 terabytes in 1992. By 1997 NCR became independent from AT&T.[17]
In 1999 NCR acquired Strategic Technologies & Systems, and appointed Stephen Brobst as chief technology officer of the Teradata Solutions Group. In April 2000 NCR acquired Ceres Integrated Solutions and its customer relationship management software for $90 million,[20] and in July Stirling Douglas Group and its demand chain management software.[21] In 2005, it acquired financial management software from DecisionPoint.[22]
In January 2007 NCR announced Teradata would become an independent public company, led by Michael F. Koehler.[23][24] The new company's shares started trading in October.[4] In March 2008 Teradata acquired professional services company Claraview, which previously had spun out software provider Clarabridge.[25]
In August 2010, Teradata acquired column-oriented DBMS vendor Kickfire.[26][27] In December it acquired marketing software company Aprimo for about $550 million.[28][29] In March 2011 it acquired Aster Data Systems for about $263 million.[30][31] In May 2012 Teradata acquired email direct marketing company eCircle, which was merged into the Aprimo business.[32]
In July, 2014, Teradata acquired the assets of Revelytix, a provider of information management products and for a reported $50 million, Hadapt, a company that developed the database management system Presto for Apache Hadoop,[33][34][35] and in September, Hadoop service firm Think Big Analytics.[36] In December, Teradata acquired RainStor, a company specializing in online data archiving on Hadoop.[37]
In January 2015 Teradata acquired Appoxxee, a mobile marketing software as a service provider, for about $20 million.[38] In September Teradata acquired digital marketing company FLXone, based in the Netherlands.[39] In November 2015, after continued losses and declining revenue, a business transformation review was announced.[3] The company terminated "co-president" Herman Wimmer in December 2015, although it later had to pay more than 4.2 million Euros and a company car as severance.[40]
In April, 2016, a product line called IntelliFlex was announced.[41] On May 5, 2016 Victor L. Lund, who had been an executive of American Stores from 1977 to 1999, became the chief executive.[42] In July 2016, the marketing applications division, using the Aprimo brand, was sold to private equity firm Marlin Equity Partners for about $90 million. This was hundreds of millions less than it paid making the acquisitions of several companies merged into the unit.[43][44] Marlin combined businesses of the former eCircle, Appoxee, and Ozone businesses with an email marketing company BlueHornet (that it had acquired in 2015), using the brand Mapp Digital in September 2016.[45]
On July 21, 2016, Teradata acquired Big Data Partnership, a service company based in the UK.[46]
Technology and products[edit]
See also: Teradata Geospatial, Teradata Warehouse Miner, and Teradata Parallel Transporter
Active enterprise data warehouse[edit]
Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse, often called Teradata Database, includes data management tools and data mining software. Teradata's product can be used for business analysis. Data warehouses can track company data, such as sales, customer preferences, product placement, etc.[6] The data warehouse differentiates between “hot and cold” data – meaning that the warehouse puts data that is not often used in a slower storage section.[47] The original system used a proprietary network technology called BYNet.[48]
Teradata Database 13.10 was announced in October 2010.[49][50] At the time, Teradata used Xeon 5600 processors for the server nodes.[51]
Teradata Database 14 was sold as the upgrade to 13.10 in 2011 and runs multiple data warehouse workloads at the same time.[52] It includes column-store analyses.[53]
Teradata Integrated Analytics[54] is a set of tools for data analysis that resides inside the data warehouse.[55]
Teradata Warehouse Miner provides and interface for data mining on Microsoft Windows. It was released before 2003.[56]
Aster Platform[edit]
The Aster Platform is Teradata's analytic technology, acquired from Aster Data Systems.[57]
Backup, archive, and restore[edit]
BAR is Teradata’s backup and recovery system.[58]
The Teradata Disaster Recovery Solution is automation and tools for data recovery and archiving. Customer data can be stored in an offsite recovery center.[59]
QueryGrid[edit]
The Teradata database includes a feature called QueryGrid, [60] that allows user of the Teradata database to fetch data from external databases from standard SQL queries, as if they were hosted in the local EDW. The data movement happens in parallel whenever possible, so it is as efficient as performance the external data source; this is usually still much slower than native Teradata database performance, but still acceptable for exploratory tasks. External data sources are Aster, Presto, Teradata, Hive and Oracle.
Platform family[edit]
Teradata Platform Family is a set of products that include the Teradata Data Warehouse, Database, and a set of analytic tools. The platform family is marketed as smaller and less expensive than the other Teradata products.[61]
Big data[edit]
Teradata began to market with the term “big data” in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to “new media sources, such as social media.”[62] The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the “Petabyte club” in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.[63]
The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology.[64] For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company’s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.[65]
Competition[edit]
Teradata's main competitors are similar products from vendors such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and Sybase IQ. Also, competitors include data warehouse appliance vendors such as Netezza[66] (acquired in November 2010 by IBM), DATAllegro (acquired in August 2008 by Microsoft), ParAccel (acquired in April 2013 by Actian in April 2013), Pivotal Greenplum Database (acquired in July 2010 by EMC Corporation in July 2010), and Vertica Systems (acquired in February 2011 by HP), and from packaged data warehouse applications such as SAP BW.
Teradata has also seen competition from Hadoop-based distributions and other open source technologies.

Backup, archive, and restore[edit]
BAR is Teradata’s backup and recovery system.[58]
The Teradata Disaster Recovery Solution is automation and tools for data recovery and archiving. Customer data can be stored in an offsite recovery center.[59]
QueryGrid[edit]
The Teradata database includes a feature called QueryGrid, [60] that allows user of the Teradata database to fetch data from external databases from standard SQL queries, as if they were hosted in the local EDW. The data movement happens in parallel whenever possible, so it is as efficient as performance the external data source; this is usually still much slower than native Teradata database performance, but still acceptable for exploratory tasks. External data sources are Aster, Presto, Teradata, Hive and Oracle.
Platform family[edit]
Teradata Platform Family is a set of products that include the Teradata Data Warehouse, Database, and a set of analytic tools. The platform family is marketed as smaller and less expensive than the other Teradata products.[61]
Big data[edit]
Teradata began to market with the term “big data” in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to “new media sources, such as social media.”[62] The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the “Petabyte club” in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.[63]
The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology.[64] For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company’s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.[65]
Competition[edit]
Teradata's main competitors are similar products from vendors such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and Sybase IQ. Also, competitors include data warehouse appliance vendors such as Netezza[66] (acquired in November 2010 by IBM), DATAllegro (acquired in August 2008 by Microsoft), ParAccel (acquired in April 2013 by Actian in April 2013), Pivotal Greenplum Database (acquired in July 2010 by EMC Corporation in July 2010), and Vertica Systems (acquired in February 2011 by HP), and from packaged data warehouse applications such as SAP BW.
Teradata has also seen competition from Hadoop-based distributions and other open source technologies.

	Operating Income



	Second quarter operating income of $133 million decreased from $147 million reported in the second quarter of 2013. On a non-GAAP basis,
	operating income was $159 million versus $174 million in the second quarter of 2013.

	(2)

	The difference was primarily due to lower margins from increased amortization of previously capitalized
	software development costs, lower service margins, and higher operating expenses including increased research and development expense.



	Cash Flow



	During the second quarter of 2014, Teradata generated $138 million of cash from operating activities, which compared to $140 million
	in the prior-year period. Teradata generated $113 million of free cash flow (cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software)

	(3)

	in the second
	quarter of 2014, versus $102 million in the same period in 2013.


	Year to date, Teradata generated $481 million of cash from operating
	activities, compared to $383 million in the prior-year period. Teradata generated $423 million of free cash flow

	(3) 

	in the first six months of 2014, a 33 percent increase from $318 million
	generated in the same period in 2013.



	Balance Sheet



	Teradata ended the quarter with $934 million in cash, a $12 million increase from March 31, 2014. During the quarter, Teradata purchased
	approximately 2.5 million shares of its stock for approximately $104 million during the quarter. Year to date, through July 31, Teradata purchased 4.5 million shares for approximately $190 million.


	 


	2






	As of June 30, 2014, Teradata had total debt of $263 million outstanding under a term loan.
	Additionally, Teradata has $300 million available through a pre-arranged credit facility; however, no funds were drawn from the credit facility.



	2014
	Outlook



	Teradata continues to expect full-year 2014 revenue to grow at the lower end of its original 3-7 percent guidance range. Based
	on currency rates at the end of July 2014, currency translation is not expected to have a meaningful impact on Teradatas full-year revenue comparison.

	(1)

	Teradata also continues to expect
	2014 non-GAAP earnings per share (which excludes stock-based compensation expense and other special items) to be at the lower end of the $2.85-$3.00 range.

	(2)




	2014 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call



	A conference call is scheduled today at 8:30 a.m. (ET) to discuss the companys second quarter 2014 results. Access to the conference
	call, as well as a replay of the call, is available on Teradatas web site at

	investor.teradata.com

	.


	Supplemental financial
	information regarding Teradatas operating results is also available on the Investor Relations page of Teradatas web site.


	 




	1.


	The impact of currency is determined by calculating the prior-period results using the current-year monthly average currency rates. See the foreign currency fluctuation schedule on the Investor Relations page of the
	companys web site at

	investor.teradata.com,

	which is used to determine revenue on a constant currency (cc) basis.

	Teradata reports its results in accordance with GAAP. However, as described below, the company believes that certain non-GAAP measures (such as non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and
	non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, or EPS, which exclude certain items as well as free cash flow) are useful for investors. Our non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or superior to, results determined
	in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.




	Special items included in Teradatas 2014 second quarter GAAP operating income results as reported in this release included $13 million
	of stock-based compensation expense; $11 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; and $2 million of acquisition, integration and reorganization expenses. In addition to the special items included in Teradatas 2014
	second quarter GAAP operating income, Teradatas GAAP net income also included a $1 million impairment of an equity investment.


	Teradatas year-to-date 2013 GAAP net income included a $4 million income tax benefit related to the 2012 U.S. Research &
	Development tax credit. This benefit was included in Teradatas non-GAAP results in the fourth quarter of 2012, since the benefit related to the 2012 tax reporting period. However, Teradata could not include the tax benefit in its GAAP results
	in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 not being enacted until January 2013. As a result, the $4 million tax benefit was included in Teradatas 2013 GAAP net income, but was excluded from the
	companys non-GAAP net income.


	The following tables reconcile Teradatas actual and projected results and EPS under GAAP to the
	companys actual and projected non-GAAP results and EPS for the periods presented, which exclude certain items. Our management regularly uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross margin, operating income, net income and EPS,
	excluding certain items internally, to understand, manage and evaluate our business and support operating decisions. The company believes such non-GAAP financial measures (1) provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying
	business trends and performance of the companys ongoing operations, (2) are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations and results, that may be more easily compared to peer companies and allow investors a view of the
	companys operating results excluding special items, (3) provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends, and (4) provide consistency and comparability with past reports and
	projections of future results.

	As described above, the company believes that free cash flow is a useful non-GAAP measure for investors. Teradata defines free cash flow as cash provided/used by operating activities less capital expenditures for
	property and equipment, and additions to capitalized software. Free cash flow does not have a uniform definition under GAAP and therefore, Teradatas definition may differ from other companies definitions of this measure. Teradatas
	management uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the company and believes it is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business
	operations. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures for, among other things, investment in the companys existing businesses, strategic acquisitions, strengthening the companys
	balance sheet, repurchase of the companys stock and repayment of the companys debt obligations, if any. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other
	nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in
	conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

	Note to Investors




	This news release contains forward-looking statements, including statements as to anticipated or expected results, beliefs, opinions and future financial
	performance, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include projections of revenue, profit growth and other financial items, future economic performance and statements concerning
	analysts earnings estimates, among other things. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Teradatas actual results to differ materially. In
	addition to the factors discussed in this release, other risks and uncertainties could affect our future results, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Such factors include those
	relating to: the global economic environment in general or on the ability of our suppliers to meet their commitments to us, or the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers, and other general economic and business conditions; the
	rapidly changing and intensely competitive nature of the information technology industry and the data analytics business, including the increased pressure on price/performance for data analytics solutions; fluctuations in our operating results,
	unanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles and the difficulty of accurately estimating revenues; risks inherent in operating in foreign countries, including the impact of economic, political, legal, regulatory, compliance, cultural,
	foreign currency fluctuations and other conditions abroad; the timely and successful development, production or acquisition and market acceptance of new and existing products and services, including our ability to accelerate market acceptance of new
	products and services as well as the reliability, quality, security and operability of new products because of the difficulty and complexity associated with their testing and production; tax rates; turnover of workforce and the ability to attract
	and retain skilled employees; availability and successful exploitation of new acquisition and alliance opportunities; our ability to execute integration plans for newly acquired entities, including the possibility that expected synergies and
	operating efficiencies may not be achieved, that such integration efforts may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected, and that operating costs, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in
	maintaining relationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers) may be greater than expected following the transaction; recurring revenue may decline or fail to be renewed; changes in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and
	the resulting impact, if any, on the companys accounting policies; continued efforts to establish and maintain best-in-class and secure internal information technology and control systems; and other factors described from time-to-time in the
	companys filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q, as well as the companys annual reports to stockholders. The company does not
	undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Teradata Corporation is a provider of database-related products and services. The company was formed in 1979 in Brentwood, California, as a collaboration between researchers at Caltech and Citibank's advanced technology group.[2] The company was acquired by NCR Corporation in 1991, and subsequently spun-off again as an independent public company on October 1, 2007.
The company produces a relational database management system of the same name, which it markets as a data warehouse. It also acquired new technologies by making many acquisitions. In 2015, after continued losses, the company announced a business transformation review, which led to divestitures and replacement of executives.[3] Teradata employed 10,093 at the end of 2016, and had corporate headquarters Dayton, Ohio.[1]

Corporate overview[edit]
Teradata is an enterprise software company that develops and sells a relational database management system (RDBMS) with the same name. Teradata is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the stock symbol TDC.[4]
The flagship Teradata product is referred to as a "data warehouse system" which stores and manages data. The data warehouses use a "shared nothing architecture", which means that each server node has its own memory and processing power.[5] Adding more servers and nodes increases the amount of data that can be stored. The database software runs on the servers and spreads the workload among them.[6] In 2010, Teradata added text analytics to track unstructured data, such as word processor documents, and semi-structured data, such as spreadsheets.[7]
Teradata has a supplier diversity program that designates a minimum of 3 to 5% of spending on minority, women, veteran, or small business vendors.[8] In 2013, the Ethisphere Institute named Teradata as one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies."[9]
Teradata holds an annual user group conference and expo known as Teradata Partners with keynote industry speakers, educational sessions led by customers and other vendors.[10] The Teradata Partners Conference has been an annual event since 1985.[11] The conference involves lectures and speeches on technical and business topics and announcements about new products.[12]
History[edit]




NCR Teradata Worldmark 5100 in 2002


The concept of Teradata grew from research at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and from the discussions of Citibank's advanced technology group in the 1970s.[13] The company was incorporated in 1979 in Brentwood, California by Jack E. Shemer, Philip M. Neches, Walter E. Muir, Jerold R. Modes, William P. Worth, Carroll Reed and David Hartke. In 1984 Teradata released its DBC/1012 specialized database computer.[14] [15] In 1990 it acquired Sharebase, originally named Britton Lee.[16]
In September 1991 AT&T Corporation acquired NCR Corporation,[17] which in December announced the acquisition of Teradata for about $250 million. Kenneth W. Simonds had been chief executive since 1986.[18] In 1992 Teradata built the first system over 1 terabyte, at Wal-Mart.[19] A Teradata database became the world's largest at 11 terabytes in 1992. By 1997 NCR became independent from AT&T.[17]
In 1999 NCR acquired Strategic Technologies & Systems, and appointed Stephen Brobst as chief technology officer of the Teradata Solutions Group. In April 2000 NCR acquired Ceres Integrated Solutions and its customer relationship management software for $90 million,[20] and in July Stirling Douglas Group and its demand chain management software.[21] In 2005, it acquired financial management software from DecisionPoint.[22]
In January 2007 NCR announced Teradata would become an independent public company, led by Michael F. Koehler.[23][24] The new company's shares started trading in October.[4] In March 2008 Teradata acquired professional services company Claraview, which previously had spun out software provider Clarabridge.[25]
In August 2010, Teradata acquired column-oriented DBMS vendor Kickfire.[26][27] In December it acquired marketing software company Aprimo for about $550 million.[28][29] In March 2011 it acquired Aster Data Systems for about $263 million.[30][31] In May 2012 Teradata acquired email direct marketing company eCircle, which was merged into the Aprimo business.[32]
In July, 2014, Teradata acquired the assets of Revelytix, a provider of information management products and for a reported $50 million, Hadapt, a company that developed the database management system Presto for Apache Hadoop,[33][34][35] and in September, Hadoop service firm Think Big Analytics.[36] In December, Teradata acquired RainStor, a company specializing in online data archiving on Hadoop.[37]
In January 2015 Teradata acquired Appoxxee, a mobile marketing software as a service provider, for about $20 million.[38] In September Teradata acquired digital marketing company FLXone, based in the Netherlands.[39] In November 2015, after continued losses and declining revenue, a business transformation review was announced.[3] The company terminated "co-president" Herman Wimmer in December 2015, although it later had to pay more than 4.2 million Euros and a company car as severance.[40]
In April, 2016, a product line called IntelliFlex was announced.[41] On May 5, 2016 Victor L. Lund, who had been an executive of American Stores from 1977 to 1999, became the chief executive.[42] In July 2016, the marketing applications division, using the Aprimo brand, was sold to private equity firm Marlin Equity Partners for about $90 million. This was hundreds of millions less than it paid making the acquisitions of several companies merged into the unit.[43][44] Marlin combined businesses of the former eCircle, Appoxee, and Ozone businesses with an email marketing company BlueHornet (that it had acquired in 2015), using the brand Mapp Digital in September 2016.[45]
On July 21, 2016, Teradata acquired Big Data Partnership, a service company based in the UK.[46]
Technology and products[edit]
See also: Teradata Geospatial, Teradata Warehouse Miner, and Teradata Parallel Transporter
Active enterprise data warehouse[edit]
Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse, often called Teradata Database, includes data management tools and data mining software. Teradata's product can be used for business analysis. Data warehouses can track company data, such as sales, customer preferences, product placement, etc.[6] The data warehouse differentiates between “hot and cold” data – meaning that the warehouse puts data that is not often used in a slower storage section.[47] The original system used a proprietary network technology called BYNet.[48]
Teradata Database 13.10 was announced in October 2010.[49][50] At the time, Teradata used Xeon 5600 processors for the server nodes.[51]
Teradata Database 14 was sold as the upgrade to 13.10 in 2011 and runs multiple data warehouse workloads at the same time.[52] It includes column-store analyses.[53]
Teradata Integrated Analytics[54] is a set of tools for data analysis that resides inside the data warehouse.[55]
Teradata Warehouse Miner provides and interface for data mining on Microsoft Windows. It was released before 2003.[56]
Aster Platform[edit]
The Aster Platform is Teradata's analytic technology, acquired from Aster Data Systems.[57]
Backup, archive, and restore[edit]
BAR is Teradata’s backup and recovery system.[58]
The Teradata Disaster Recovery Solution is automation and tools for data recovery and archiving. Customer data can be stored in an offsite recovery center.[59]
QueryGrid[edit]
The Teradata database includes a feature called QueryGrid, [60] that allows user of the Teradata database to fetch data from external databases from standard SQL queries, as if they were hosted in the local EDW. The data movement happens in parallel whenever possible, so it is as efficient as performance the external data source; this is usually still much slower than native Teradata database performance, but still acceptable for exploratory tasks. External data sources are Aster, Presto, Teradata, Hive and Oracle.
Platform family[edit]
Teradata Platform Family is a set of products that include the Teradata Data Warehouse, Database, and a set of analytic tools. The platform family is marketed as smaller and less expensive than the other Teradata products.[61]
Big data[edit]
Teradata began to market with the term “big data” in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to “new media sources, such as social media.”[62] The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the “Petabyte club” in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.[63]
The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology.[64] For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company’s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.[65]
Competition[edit]
Teradata's main competitors are similar products from vendors such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and Sybase IQ. Also, competitors include data warehouse appliance vendors such as Netezza[66] (acquired in November 2010 by IBM), DATAllegro (acquired in August 2008 by Microsoft), ParAccel (acquired in April 2013 by Actian in April 2013), Pivotal Greenplum Database (acquired in July 2010 by EMC Corporation in July 2010), and Vertica Systems (acquired in February 2011 by HP), and from packaged data warehouse applications such as SAP BW.
Teradata has also seen competition from Hadoop-based distributions and other open source technologies.

3 Things Teradata Corp.'s Management Wants You to Know
The data analytics software maker is selling its wares under a new, subscription-based pricing model. The transition is hurting Teradata's revenues right now but should start paying dividends as early as next year.











                Anders Bylund
            

                (TMFZahrim)



            
            Jul 28, 2017 at 8:42AM
            
            





Data analytics specialist Teradata (NYSE:TDC) reported second-quarter results early Thursday morning. Adjusted earnings came in 69% below the year-ago period's results at $0.22 per diluted share, and top-line sales fell 14% to land at $513 million. Both of these figures were at or below the low end of Teradata's guidance for the quarter, and they also fell short of Wall Street's expectations.
That might sound like a recipe for hurting Teradata investors right in the pocketbook, but that's not what happened at all. Instead, share prices raced as much as 11.6% higher on the news, swinging very close to the stock's 52-week highs.
Crazy, I know -- stocks are not supposed to soar when the company misses its earnings targets. But this move actually makes sense. These three key details from Teradata's earnings report and conference call will show you how and why.

1. Accelerating guidance
After dodging full-year guidance in the last two earnings reports, Teradata finally put together a framework for the second half of 2017. It's looking pretty good.
Full-year revenues should come in roughly 9% below the 2016 tally. That's a smaller drop than the 10% seen in the first quarter, and obviously below the 14% plunge in the second quarter. In other words, sales trends should turn significantly more positive in the second half, and Teradata emphasized that the fourth quarter should outperform the third by a wide margin.
This guidance update played a large part in Teradata's sudden stock price boost on Thursday.
2. Subscription revenues
Peeling back one more layer of Teradata's evolving business model, we get to one important reason why sales are stumbling now but headed upward later on.
The company has been offering a new subscription-based pricing model for its enterprise data analytics services for less than a year. In the long run, management would love to move every customer to a subscription plan, because it turns a one-time payment into a long-term contract with smaller fees paid over several years.
Management sees this as a win-win for Teradata and its clients.
"With our simplified pricing tiers and subscription-based licenses, it is easy for customers to get started quickly and affordably and pay as they go instead of working through a long capital approval process," said chief product officer Oliver Ratzesberger in the earnings call, according to a transcript compiled by Seeking Alpha. "We are seeing customers adopt subscription licenses more rapidly than expected and this is building future recurring product revenue for us."
Teradata would not be the first enterprise computing company to move in this direction. Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) headed down that path a few years ago, and the Photoshop maker's revenue chart speaks volumes about how that move is working out:

ADBE Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
These days, subscription sales account for 84% of Adobe's total quarterly revenues, up from 58% in 2014 and just 15% five years ago. Teradata hopes to follow a similar parabolic curve over the next few years, and is arguably sitting in that uncomfortable revenue trough that Adobe experienced in 2014.





3. The bounce is coming, and soon
CFO Stephen Scheppmann called 2017 a building year, where the company is setting the stage for greater things in the future. Revenue growth is coming back as soon as 2018 as the subscription-based pricing model continues to evolve.
And the company is not afraid to invest in itself while shares are cheap.
"Customers are embracing our hybrid cloud deployment and pricing consumption options, and as a result, we are even more confident in our strategy and plan to acquire up to $300 million of our stock during the second half of 2017," Scheppmann said.
Low-cost buybacks can be a tremendously effective use of cash, assuming that the turnaround really is right around the corner. As such, Scheppmann's statement here is a $300 million vote of confidence in a successful transition to subscription-driven sales growth.
So all things considered, Teradata cleared up some confusion around its evolving business model in this quarterly report. Sales are slow right now but for good reason, and a big bounce is coming. That was all it took to trigger a quick share price jump on Thursday.

	 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS




	Forward-looking statements in our public filings or other public statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or other public statements. These forward-looking statements were based on various facts and were derived utilizing numerous important assumptions and other important factors, and changes in such facts, assumptions or factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include the information concerning our future financial performance, business strategy, projected plans and objectives. Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “plans,” “may increase,” “may fluctuate,” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “should,” “would,” “may” and “could” are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. You should understand that the factors described under “Risk Factors” and the following important factors could affect our future results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements:













	•






	our ability to timely and effectively implement our business transformation plan and the execution of our new strategy;
















	•






	the rapidly changing and intensely competitive nature of the information technology (“IT”) industry and the analytic data platform business, including the ongoing consolidation activity, threats from new and emerging analytic data technologies and competitors, and pressure on achieving continued price/performance gains for analytic data solutions;
















	•






	fluctuations in our operating results, timing of transactions, unanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles and the difficulty of accurately estimating revenues, particularly in light of our strategic shift to more revenue over time and the difficulty predicting the extent to which our customers will choose these deployment options;
















	•






	our ability to successfully leverage acquisitions;
















	•






	the impact of global economic fluctuations on the markets in general or on the ability of our suppliers and customers to meet their commitments to us, or the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers; and
















	•






	risks inherent in operating in foreign countries, including the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, economic, political, legal, regulatory, compliance, cultural and other conditions abroad.







	Other factors not identified above, including the risk factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by our forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are difficult to anticipate and are generally beyond our reasonable control. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events.















	Item 1. BUSINESS




	Overview.


	 Teradata Corporation ("we," "us," "Teradata," or the "Company") is a global leader in analytics solutions and services. We empower companies to achieve high-impact business outcomes through analytics at scale, enabled by our technology. We help customers know how and where to use analytics and data to drive business value. We also help customers architect their analytical ecosystem to match technology choices to business needs, and we deploy analytics technology that businesses can scale to meet their growing data analytic needs. Our strategy is to deliver business value by being the best analytical partner to the world’s leading firms across a broad set of industries who have high-priority and complex analytical needs.




	Our offerings include analytics solutions, ecosystem architecture consulting and hybrid cloud solutions. These solutions include software and hardware technology components such as data warehousing, big data, and tools for data integration, data discovery, and business intelligence. Our services help companies architect, manage, and

	Table of Contents









	integrate their complex and ever-changing analytic ecosystem, and include technology and data architecture consulting, analytic business consulting, open source consulting, and “as-a-service” offerings in the cloud. Additionally, we offer a comprehensive set of support services. In 2016, we announced our new Teradata Everywhere



	TM



	offering through which we provide our Teradata database software in a production-scale and deployment agnostic manner. As a result, we now offer our customers flexible deployment options on-premises, in a private cloud, in the public cloud, in the cloud at a Teradata data center or as a hybrid combination of these offerings.Teradata operates from numerous locations within the United States ("U.S.") with the primary locations being Dayton, Ohio; Johns Creek (Atlanta), Georgia; and Rancho Bernardo (San Diego), California. In addition, we have sales, services, research and development, and administrative offices located in 45 countries.




	For the full year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, we had net income of


	$125 million


	 and total revenues of


	$2.322 billion


	, of which approximately


	97%


	 was derived from the data and analytics segment and


	3%


	 from the marketing applications segment, which was sold on July 1, 2016. For financial information about these segments and geographic information, see “Note 11—Segment, Other Supplemental Information and Concentrations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report.




	History.


	 Teradata was formed in 1979 as a Delaware corporation, driven by the need for robust computing power to harness the value of aggregated data. In 1984, Teradata established a massively parallel relational database management system that enabled companies to easily scale their data management needs, revolutionizing data analysis for customers. In 1991, AT&T Corp. ("AT&T") acquired NCR Corporation ("NCR") and, later that year, the combined company of AT&T / NCR purchased Teradata.




	In 1996, AT&T spun off NCR (including Teradata) to form the independent, publicly-traded NCR. On September 30, 2007, the independent, publicly-traded Teradata Corporation (NYSE: TDC) was created when NCR was effectively separated into two independent, publicly-traded companies through the distribution of 100% of its Teradata data warehousing business to shareholders of NCR.




	Since that time, we have increased our investments and focus to be the best analytical partner to the world’s leading firms. We continue to invest to extend our research and development in analytics and analytic consulting.




	On July 1, 2016, we completed the sale of our marketing applications business to exclusively focus on our analytics solutions business, in support of our transformation plans.




	Industry and Market Opportunity




	Our view is that analytics is and will continue to be a management priority for most companies and, in particular, for the majority of our customers. We believe we have a large market opportunity, as Teradata’s strategy encompasses the multi-billion dollar and growing markets of data management, analytic tools and consulting, and packaged analytics, as well as the related consulting and accompanying maintenance services. As organizations work to manage the evolution to increasing digital environments, we believe that they will need help leveraging analytics to deliver high-impact business outcomes. We also believe that companies will need help to implement the right analytic ecosystem architecture, leveraging both commercial and open source technologies. We have tailored Teradata's offerings to meet these needs and to help companies navigate the multitude of ecosystem options, as well as various alternatives for deployment.









	We are focused on the 500 largest analytic opportunities globally as we believe that this portion of the market will have the highest growth in the amount of data analytic processing power they consume. We plan to grow revenue in this market segment by expanding our existing customers' analytical ecosystems as well as adding new customers. Overall, we believe that key differentiators for Teradata include the following:













	•






	Proven experience in solving complex analytical problems,
















	•






	Real-world expertise deploying ecosystems and analytics, and
















	•






	Leading production-scale, deployment agnostic technologies.







	Customers.


	Our new strategy prioritizes our sales focus on business users, as well as technology buyers at leading companies across a broad set of industries, including banking/financial services, communications (including telecommunications, e-business, and media and entertainment), energy, government, insurance and healthcare,








	5









	Table of Contents









	manufacturing, oil and gas, retail, travel and transportation logistics, and utilities. These industries provide a good fit for our analytics solutions and services, as they tend to have the greatest analytic potential, with large and growing data volumes, and expanding sources of data, complex data management requirements, or large and varied groups of users.




	The extent to which any given customer contributes to our revenues generally varies significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter. Therefore, a customer with a large order in one quarter is likely to generate additional revenue for Teradata in subsequent periods as we provide support services and additional capacity as their analytical ecosystem evolves and grows to meet their business requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top ten customers collectively accounted for approximately 15% of our total revenues. Moreover, Teradata’s revenue can vary considerably from period to period given the different growth and purchasing patterns of our existing customers’ data warehouse systems, discovery platforms and data management platforms as well as the variable timing of new customer orders. Due to the size and complexity of these transactions (purchases), the sales cycle for a new analytic solution is often fairly long (typically more than a year). Historically, our results in any particular quarter have generally been dependent on our ability to generate a relatively small number of large orders for that quarter. However, we are actively converting customers from perpetual to over time pricing models, which will likely create many more smaller, but more frequent transactions, which will likely decrease the overall variability in the timing of our revenue as we transition to new operating expense-based deployment and purchasing options.









	Our Strategy









	Teradata is focusing on addressing the needs of the analytics future, as we enable organizations to deliver value through analytics. Through our consultative approach, focused on leading with business outcomes, our goal is to serve as a trusted advisor to both the business and technical leaders in our customers’ organizations. Our business analytics solutions are ideally suited for the world’s largest companies who have the most complex analytics requirements and the need to scale. Teradata’s focus is on being “business outcome led, technology enabled”, as we deliver business value through analytics, as a trusted advisor to both business buyers and IT buyers. Our strategic approach is to make it easy to buy and grow with Teradata. We believe that this strategic approach will best position us to be our customers’ trusted advisor and analytic partner of choice.




	Our Solutions




	There are three key solutions in our portfolio which support our strategy and which drive consumption of Teradata database software: Hybrid Cloud Solutions, Business Analytics Solutions and Ecosystem Architecture Consulting. In addition, we offer support services to allow customers to maximize availability and better leverage the value of their investments in Teradata solutions.




	Hybrid Cloud Solutions




	Our Hybrid Cloud Solutions deliver an end-to-end analytical ecosystem across a hybrid cloud architecture. Our offerings provide the ability to manage and access data across all deployment options, including:













	•






	Teradata Software Sold on Public Clouds


	 for the segment in the market that wants to purchase Teradata software and deploy it in the public cloud of their choice.
















	•






	Teradata Managed Cloud Solutions


	 for the market segment looking for a fully managed service. Our Managed Cloud solutions make it easy for customers; by allowing them to focus on their business while our skilled data scientists and data management experts manage the customers' analytical ecosystem for them.
















	•






	Hybrid Cloud Solutions


	 blending both on-premises and cloud environments. We expect the majority of companies to deploy hybrid cloud architectures.







	Our core Teradata database remains a key component within Hybrid Cloud Solutions-it is a critical element in delivering our best-in-class analytics at scale. It provides the foundation for our unique ability to support and manage a wide range of mixed workloads and analytic data functions. Another key component is our Teradata Intelliflex™ Platform, which is our next-generation massively parallel processing ("MPP") architecture. Its fabric-based structure provides multi-dimensional scalability, enabling companies to add processing power and storage

	capacity independently to meet their current and changing business requirements. A key technology in Intelliflex is the use of hybrid storage that combines Solid State Drive ("SSD") and Hard Disk Drive ("HDD") technologies to optimize performance while appropriately managing costs. Teradata IntelliFlex brings the agile and flexible growth benefits of our cloud offerings to the on-premises environment for our customers.




	Business Analytics Solutions




	Through our Business Analytics Solutions, we provide a




	consultative approach to identify and deliver value to business buyers supported by analytic business consulting, data science, and repeatable intellectual property ("IP"). Our Business Analytics Solutions include:


















	•






	Analytic Business Consulting


	 to innovate with our customers on large, complex problems to deliver high-impact business outcomes.












	Our business consultants work with customers to discover insights in high-impact areas where we can deliver positive business outcomes. In some cases, we work with customers in areas where we already have experience and assets to leverage, and can accelerate their time to value through our proven methods, IP, and technologies. In other cases, we work with customers to identify and solve new challenges, while capturing new assets. We utilize our global best practices including Business Value Frameworks and our Rapid Analytic Consulting Engagement ("RACE") agile methodology.


















	•






	IP Capture and Management


	 so solutions built for our customers


	are developed once, and then systematically leveraged


	,


	 to support future customers


	. This approach is designed to provide rapid return on investment for customers.












	Ecosystem Architecture Consulting









	Our Ecosystem Architecture Consulting helps customers build an optimized analytical ecosystem independent of technology, leveraging Teradata, open source and other commercial solutions. Here, our consultants guide chief information officers and their teams in creating the optimal analytical ecosystem for our customers, based on our collective understanding of enterprise-grade scaled analytics, data warehousing, and the open source ecosystem.









	Support Services









	Our customer services offerings include both proactive and reactive services, including installation, maintenance, monitoring, back-up, and recovery services to allow customers to maximize availability and better leverage the value of their investments in Teradata solutions. They assist customers 24x7x365 for both on-site and remote support. Our customer services team is highly experienced and provides a single point of contact and delivery for the deployment, support and ongoing management of Teradata solutions around the world.









	Partners, Marketing and Distribution Channels









	Strategic Partnerships.


	We seek to leverage our sales and marketing reach by partnering with leading global and regional systems integrators, independent software vendors, Hadoop distributors, and consultants, which we believe complement our analytics data platforms.


















	•






	Alliance Partners


	-Strategic partnerships are a key factor in our ability to leverage the value and expand the scope of our analytic solutions in the marketplace. Our partner program is focused on working collaboratively with independent software vendors in several areas, including tools, data and application integration solutions, data mining, analytics, business intelligence, specific analytic and industry solutions. Our goal is to provide choices to our customers with partner offerings that are optimized and certified with our solutions, and fit within the customer’s analytic environment.





















	•






	Systems Integrators


	-We also work with a range of systems integrators and consultants that engage in the design, implementation and integration of analytic solutions and analytic applications for our joint clients.











	7









	Table of Contents









	Our strategic partnerships with select global consulting and systems integration firms provide broad industry and technology expertise in the design of business solutions that leverage Teradata technology to enable enterprise analytics. Our strategic global consulting and systems integration partners include Accenture Limited, Capgemini Group, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Deloitte LLP, International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), and Wipro Limited.









	Sales and Marketing.


	We primarily sell and market our solutions and services through a direct sales force, and are aligning our sales teams to best address the 500 largest analytic opportunities globally. We are applying differential resourcing to ensure that our sales and marketing investments are aligned with the customers’ long-term value to Teradata. We have approximately 80% of our employees in customer-facing and/or revenue driving roles (including sales, consulting and customer service, and product engineering).









	We support our sales force with marketing and training programs which are designed to:













	•






	grow awareness, highlighting our technology leadership and differentiation, and our consulting expertise in the market,
















	•






	create demand for our products and services,
















	•






	educate the sales force to build skills and knowledge, as well as
















	•






	provide a robust set of tools for use by our direct sales force.












	We employ a broad range of marketing strategies including programs to inform and educate customers and prospects, the media, industry analysts, academics and other third-party influencers. These strategies include targeted, account-based marketing, our global website, webinars, physical and virtual trade shows and conferences, public and media relations, social media, and an extensive customer reference program.









	Sources of Materials.


	 Our hardware components are assembled and configured by Flextronics International Ltd. (“Flextronics”). Our platform line is designed to leverage the components from industry leaders. Our data storage devices and memory components utilize industry-standard technologies, but are selected and configured to work optimally with our software and hardware platform. Flextronics also procures a wide variety of components used in the assembly process on our behalf. Although many of these components are available from multiple sources, Teradata utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure more consistent quality, cost and delivery. Typically, these preferred suppliers maintain alternative processes and/or facilities to ensure business continuity of supply. Given our strategy to outsource product assembly activities to Flextronics and to source certain components from single suppliers, a disruption in production at Flextronics or at a supplier, or a global shortage of components, could impact the timing or profitability of customer shipments.









	Competition


	. We compete in a large and growing market that is attractive to both legacy and new competitors. Our competition includes new analytics services companies, cloud vendors and open source providers, as well as large traditional competitors, such as IBM and Oracle Corporation ("Oracle"). We believe our focus on business outcomes and proven success will enable us to successfully compete and win with the largest analytic opportunities in the market. We believe our proven architecture for both structured and unstructured data, integrated solutions with high-performing and scalable technology, flexible deployment options in the cloud and on-premises, deep and broad consulting and support services capabilities, strong customer relationships, and our successful track record will collectively enable us to continue to compete successfully. We also compete successfully in the marketplace by offering our ecosystem architecture consulting to help customers bring together our leading software, hardware and related services with open source offerings. For more information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.









	Competitors take different technical and integration approaches to addressing data analytic needs, and therefore they often recommend a different architecture than we do. We believe that our customers recognize the advantages of our technologies and our approach as described above.









	Key factors used to evaluate competitors in these markets include: data analytics experience; business outcome delivery; hybrid cloud offerings and experience; customer references; technology leadership; product quality; performance, scalability, availability and manageability; support and consulting services capabilities; management








	8









	Table of Contents









	of technologies in a complex analytical ecosystem; industry knowledge; and total cost of ownership. We believe we have a competitive advantage in providing complete, integrated, and optimized analytic data platforms and analytic




	services that address customers’ business, technical and architecture requirements. Our differentiation is especially strong with customers that have mission critical, complex, large scale environments and requirements.









	Many companies participate in adjacent areas of the analytics market, such as enterprise analytic and business intelligence application software. The status of our business relationships with these companies can influence our ability to compete. Our products also complement offerings of some of our competitors, with whom we have formed partnerships to work with their business intelligence and application software businesses. Examples of these companies include both IBM and Oracle, due to their acquisitions of other business intelligence and consulting companies in recent years.









	Seasonality.


	Historically our sales are seasonal, in line with capital spending patterns of our customers, with lower revenue typically in the first quarter and higher revenue generally in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Such seasonality causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume, timing and mix of product sales. Typically, cash provided by operating activities is higher in the first half of the year due to the higher receivable balances at December 31 and the increase in deferred revenue resulting from the timing of annual renewals of our maintenance support agreements. In addition, revenue in the third month of each quarter has historically been significantly higher than in the first and second months. These factors, among others as more fully described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results.









	Research and Development ("R&D").


	 We remain focused on designing and developing Hybrid Cloud Solutions that anticipate our customers' evolving technological and delivery needs. As we seek improvements in our products and services, we also consider our customers' current needs as we design our new technology so that new generations of the Teradata database software and platform technology are compatible with prior generations of our technology. We believe our extensive R&D workforce is one of our core strengths. The global R&D team is located in multiple facilities around the world to take advantage of global engineering talent. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures, which may include complementary strategic acquisitions, in order to help support the flow of innovative, high-quality products, cloud-based offerings, services and applications, which is vital to our leading competitive position. For information regarding the accounting and costs included in R&D activities see “Note 1-Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report.









	Intellectual Property and Technology.


	The Company owns 702 patents in the U.S. and 38 patents in foreign countries. The foreign patents are generally counterparts of the Company’s U.S. patents. Many of the patents that we own are licensed to others, and we are licensed to use certain patents owned by others. While our portfolio of patents and patent applications in aggregate is of significant value to our Company, we do not believe that any particular individual patent is by itself of material importance to our business as a whole.




	In addition, the Company owns copyrights and trade secrets in its vast code base which makes up all of the Teradata software products including analytic data platforms and analytic applications. Teradata’s software products reflect the investment of hundreds of person-years of development work.




	The source code versions of our products are protected as trade secrets and, in all major markets, as unpublished copyright works. We also protect our rights in all of our software products and related intellectual property; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. The Company owns the Teradata


	®


	 and Aster


	®


	 trademarks, which are registered in the U.S. and in many foreign countries, as well as other trade names, service marks, and trademarks.




	Employees.


	As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 10,093 employees globally. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel.




	Properties and Facilities.


	Our corporate headquarters is located in Dayton, Ohio, although our Johns Creek (Atlanta), Georgia; and Rancho Bernardo (San Diego), California facilities are also primary locations (within the

	Table of Contents









	U.S.). As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we operated 114 facilities in 45 countries throughout the world. We own our Rancho Bernardo research and development complex, while all of our other facilities are leased.

	Item 1A. RISK FACTORS




	You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.




	In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.




	If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.




	The failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our business transformation plan and execution of our new strategy - including transition to new business focus areas and delivery models, sales structures, talent management restructuring, and cost rationalization initiatives could adversely impact our business and financial results.




	The successful implementation of our business transformation plan to evolve with the market and expand our market opportunity presents significant organizational and infrastructure challenges. As a result, we may not be able to implement and realize the anticipated benefits from our plan. Events and circumstances, such as financial or unforeseen difficulties, delays and unexpected costs, may occur that could result in our not realizing desired outcomes. Any failure to implement the plan in accordance with our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized, there may be consequences, internal control issues, or business impacts that were not expected. Additionally, as a result of our restructuring efforts in connection with our business transformation plan, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating activities and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these activities, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.




	From time to time, the Company exits businesses or attempts to sell assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives, such as the marketing applications business which was sold on July 1, 2016. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary government or regulatory approvals, risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company’s control, and risks related to the need to provide transition services to the disposed business, which may result in the diversion of resources and focus.




	As part of our transformation strategy, the Company will release new offerings and employ new product and services delivery methods, such as software-only, software as a service, and cloud offerings. It is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary business models, infrastructure and systems to support the business. This includes having or hiring the right talent to execute our business strategy. Market acceptance of new product and service offerings will be dependent in part on our ability to include functionality and usability that address customer requirements, and optimally price our products and services to meet customer demand and cover our costs. Our go-to-market strategy also must adjust to customers' changing buying preferences and our new products and delivery options, and there can be no assurance that our new go-to-market plans will adequately and completely address such preferences. New product and services offerings may increase our risk of liability and cause us to incur significant technical, legal or other costs. For example, with our cloud-based offerings, market acceptance is affected by a variety of factors, including information security, reliability, performance, the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in certain geographies, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage its data and access this data once a contract has expired, and consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or








	12









	Table of Contents









	regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers. If we are unable to respond to these threats, our business could be harmed.




	Economic Pressures and Uncertainty-Our business is affected by the global economies in which we operate and the economic climate of the industries we serve.




	Our business and results of operations are affected by international, national and regional economic conditions. In particular, the IT industry in which we operate is susceptible to significant changes in the strength of the economy and the financial health of companies and governmental entities that make capital commitments for new technologies. Since mid-2012, we have seen a shift in the market and in customers’ buying patterns, with respect to large capital investments and related services. Accordingly, downturns or uncertainty in the global or regional economies in which we operate or certain economic sectors (such as retail, manufacturing, financial services or government) may adversely impact our business. For example, adverse changes to the economy could impact the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers or the ability of our customers to fulfill their obligations to us. In addition, decreased or more closely scrutinized capital spending in our customers’ businesses and in the industries we also serve may adversely impact our business. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Accordingly, global economic and market conditions may cause material impacts on our results of operations, prospects and financial condition. The Company’s success in periods of economic uncertainty is also dependent, in part, on our ability to reduce costs in response to changes in demand and other activity.




	Competition-The IT industry is intensely competitive and evolving, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our pricing practices or demand for our products and services.




	We operate in the intensely competitive IT industry, which is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and models for consuming and delivering business and IT services, frequent new product introductions, and price and cost reductions. In general, as a participant in the analytic data solutions market, we face:













	•






	Changes in customer IT spending preferences and other shifts in market demands, which drive changes in the Company's competition;
















	•






	Continued pressure on price/performance for analytic data platform solutions due to constant technology improvements in processor capacity and speed;
















	•






	Changes in pricing, marketing and product strategies, such as potential aggressive price discounting and the use of different pricing models by our competitors or other factors;
















	•






	Rapid changes in computing technology and capabilities that challenge our ability to maintain differentiation at the lower range of business intelligence analytic functions;
















	•






	New and emerging analytic data technologies, competitors, and business models;
















	•






	Continued emergence of open source software that often attempts to rival current technology offerings at a much lower cost despite its limited functionality;
















	•






	Rapid changes in product delivery models, such as on-premises solutions versus cloud solutions;
















	•






	Changing competitive requirements and deliverables in developing and emerging markets; and
















	•






	Continuing trend toward consolidation of companies which could adversely affect our ability to compete, including if our key partners merge or partner with our competitors.







	To compete successfully in this environment, we must rapidly and continually design, develop and market solutions and related products and services that are valued in the marketplace. To do this, we must react on a timely basis to shifts in market demands. Our market position depends on our ability to continually improve the price/performance of our solutions, while maintaining efficient operations to sustain our competitive operating margins. We must also maintain the quality of our products and services throughout these shifts in market demand. If we are unable to react quickly when and as needed to improve the value of our product offerings our operating results could be negatively impacted.




	Our competitors include certain larger companies, such as IBM and Oracle, which are well-capitalized companies with widespread distribution, brand recognition and penetration of platforms and service offerings. The significant purchasing and market power of these larger competitors, which have greater financial resources than we do, could








	13









	Table of Contents









	allow them to surpass our market penetration and marketing efforts to promote and sell their products and services. In addition, many other companies participate in specific areas of our business, such as enterprise applications, analytic data platforms and business intelligence software. In some cases we may partner with a company in one area of our business and compete with them in another. The status of our business relationships with these companies can influence our ability to compete for analytic data solutions opportunities in such areas. We also expect additional competition from both established and emerging companies. Failure to compete successfully with new or existing competitors in these and other areas could have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate additional revenues or sustain existing revenue levels.




	Analytic Data Solutions Market-If the overall analytic data solutions market declines or does not grow, we may sell fewer products and services, and our business may not be able to sustain and/or grow its current level of operations.




	As the market trends toward more limited IT spending, there could be fewer customer transactions, or smaller transactions, or customers delaying investments in our products and services. In the past, we have seen periodic breaks in the buying patterns from some of our larger customers, which indicate a level of maturation of their current data warehouse implementation or a shifting of IT priorities when these customers are still leveraging the investments they have made in their core data warehousing infrastructures during past years. In addition, reduced prices and improvements in analytic data solutions may increase pressure on our product revenues and margins, as well as on the annuity streams we receive from our maintenance business. If the growth rates for the analytic data solutions market decline for any reason, there could be a decrease in demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.




	Renewal Rates and Support Services-If our existing customers fail to renew their support agreements, if customers do not license updated software products on terms favorable to us, or if customers do not renew their subscription license arrangements with us, our revenues could be adversely affected.




	We currently derive a significant portion of our overall revenues from maintenance services and unspecified when-and-if-available upgrades, and we depend on our installed customer base for future revenue from maintenance services and upgrades to updated products. The terms of our standard maintenance services and software upgrade arrangements generally provide for the payment of license fees and prepayment of first-year support fees and are generally renewable on an annual basis. The IT industry generally has been experiencing increasing pricing pressure from customers when purchasing or renewing support agreements. Mergers and acquisitions in certain industries that we serve could result in a reduction of the software and hardware being serviced and put pressure on our maintenance terms with customers who have merged. Given this environment, there can be no assurance that our current customers will renew their maintenance agreements or agree to the same terms when they renew, which could result in our reducing or losing maintenance fees.




	If our existing customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements, or if we are unable to generate additional maintenance fees through the license of updated products to existing or new customers, our business and future operating results could be adversely affected.




	Replacements of older Teradata systems often result in less hardware maintenance revenue since Teradata’s newer hardware is designed to be more powerful, use less energy and require less floor space. As a result, less hardware is needed for the same workload, and therefore less maintenance may be required on the newer generation system. However, it is been common that when a customer replaces an older platform, they often have also expanded the size and scope of their Teradata system, resulting in an increase in maintenance revenue, though not at the same rate of increase as product revenue.




	Additionally, Teradata’s solution offerings have been expanded to include subscription licenses, hosting arrangements and software as a service, which can change the timing of when revenues are recognized. Additionally, future revenue streams could be adversely affected if customers do not renew their subscription licenses, hosting arrangements or software as a service arrangements.

	Operating Result Fluctuations-Our financial results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors that could result in our failing to achieve anticipated financial results.




	Our quarterly and annual financial results have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, if transactions that we expect to close by the end of a quarter are not closed until a later date, our revenue and/or net income for that quarter could be substantially below expectations, especially given the large size of our transactions. These and any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us not to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations. The resulting failure to meet market expectations could cause a decrease in our stock price. These factors include the risks discussed elsewhere in this section and the following:













	•






	Downturns in our customers’ businesses, in the domestic economy or in international economies where our customers do substantial business;
















	•






	Changes in demand for our products and services, including changes in growth rates in the analytic data solutions market;
















	•






	The size, timing and contractual terms of large orders for our products and services, which may impact in particular our quarterly operating results (either positively or negatively);
















	•






	Possible delays in our ability to recognize revenue as the result of contract terms;
















	•






	The budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers;
















	•






	Changes in pricing policies resulting from competitive pressures, such as aggressive price discounting by our competitors, new pricing strategies, or other factors;
















	•






	Changes in how customers prefer to purchase analytical solutions;
















	•






	Our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new or enhanced versions of our products and services;
















	•






	Changes in the mix of pre-tax earnings attributable to domestic versus international sales;
















	•






	Seasonal fluctuations in buying patterns;
















	•






	Future acquisitions and divestitures of technologies, products and businesses;
















	•






	Unexpected needs for capital expenditures or other unanticipated expenses; and
















	•






	Changes in certain assumptions, estimates and judgments of management (which are required in connection with the preparation of the Company’s financial statements) that could affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities.







	Acquisitions and Alliances-Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and effectively manage acquisitions may be an important element of future growth.




	We are continually evaluating the most effective ways to extend Teradata’s core technology and expand our family of compatible analytic platforms and solutions to address multiple market segments and solution offerings. From time to time, this includes acquisitions, equity investments or joint ventures. Such transactions entail various risks, including risks associated with:













	•






	Assimilating and integrating different business operations, corporate cultures, personnel, infrastructure and technologies or products acquired or licensed;
















	•






	Retaining key employees and maintaining relationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers of the acquired companies,
















	•






	Recurring revenue of the acquired company may decline or fail to be renewed;
















	•






	The potential for unknown liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, compliance or quality issues within the acquired or combined business or additional costs not anticipated at the time of acquisition;
















	•






	Disruptions of our ongoing business or inability to successfully incorporate acquired products, services or technologies into our solutions and maintain quality;
















	•






	Failure to achieve the projected synergies after integration of acquired companies or a decline in value of the acquired business and related impairments;
















	•






	Funding acquisition activities, whether through the use of existing cash reserves, or through the use of debt, and the related impact on our liquidity and financial condition; and
















	•






	Failure to realize all the economic benefits from these acquisitions, equity investments or joint ventures could result in an impairment of goodwill, intangible assets or other assets, which could result in a significant adverse impact to our results of operations.











	15









	Table of Contents









	Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of acquisitions and related integration activities, as well as other strategic growth transactions, and there is a risk that our financial results may be adversely affected.




	Changing Tax Rates-A change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business.




	A number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; changes in available tax credits, especially surrounding tax credits in the U.S. for our research and development activities; and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, however, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition.




	Changes in U.S. or international tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside the U.S. until those earnings are repatriated to the U.S. In addition, unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, to address “base erosion and profit shifting” by multinational companies could also have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.




	Sales Cycle Variations-Unanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles make accurate estimation of our revenues difficult and could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.




	The size and timing of large orders for our products and services varies considerably, which can impact results from quarter to quarter. The process we use to forecast sales and trends in our business relies heavily on estimates of closure on a transaction-specific basis. It is very difficult to predict sales in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time. Unanticipated delays or accelerations in our sales cycles make accurate estimation of our revenues difficult and could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.




	The length of our sales cycle varies depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control, including the size and complexity of a potential transaction, the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities and our current and potential customers’ internal budgeting and approval process, as well as overall macro-economic conditions. As a result of a generally long sales cycle, we may expend significant effort over a long period of time in an attempt to obtain an order, but ultimately not complete the sale, or the order ultimately received may be smaller than anticipated. Our revenue from different customers varies from quarter to quarter, and a customer with a large order in one quarter may generate significantly lower revenue in subsequent periods. Our results in any particular quarter have generally been dependent on the timing of a relatively small number of large transactions.




	Due to resulting fluctuations, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, margins, and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance.




	In addition, the budgeting and IT capital spending cycles of our customers and potential customers make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results. Spending may be particularly heavy in our fourth quarter because of large enterprise customers placing orders before the expiration of IT budgets tied to that calendar year.




	Our operating expense budgets (including such categories as headcount, real estate, and technology resources) are based on projected annual and quarterly revenue levels and are generally incurred ratably throughout each quarter. Since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, failure to generate projected revenues for a specified period could adversely impact our operating results, reducing net income or causing an operating loss for








	16









	Table of Contents









	that period. The deferral or non-occurrence of such sales revenues could adversely affect our operating results for that quarter and could negatively impact our business in future periods.




	Seasonal Variability-Seasonal trends in sales of our products and services could adversely affect our quarterly operating results.




	In general, we see fluctuations in buying patterns with lower revenue in the first quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year. Such seasonality also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume, timing and mix of product sales. In addition, revenue in the third month of each quarter has historically been significantly higher than in the first and second months, which further impacts our ability to predict financial results accurately and enhances the enterprise risks inherent in our business. These and other factors make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately.




	Revenue Mix Variability-Our revenue is variable depending on the mix of products and services in any given period, and changes in the mix of products and services that we sell could materially adversely affect our operating results.




	Our business model is based on our anticipated mix of products and services and the corresponding profit margins for such products and services. Unfavorable shifts in such mix could adversely impact our results of operations and require changes to our business model. Consulting services margins are generally lower than the other elements of our analytic data solutions. In addition, when we use third parties to supplement some consulting services we provide to customers, this generally results in lower margin rates. As a result, increases in consulting services revenues as a percentage of our total revenues may decrease overall margins.




	We also realize different average selling prices and margins on different versions of our analytic data platforms, as well as certain components we re-sell as part of our solutions, and the mix of such hardware and software varies from quarter to quarter depending on customer requirements. In addition, changes in the price and performance of our analytic data platforms, particularly for certain hardware components, could negatively impact maintenance and support services revenues. Additionally, as we implement part of our business transformation plan and shift from upfront perpetual licenses to recurring over time models for both on-premises and cloud offerings, our revenue mix may be impacted.




	Advancement of Our Solutions-The solutions we sell are advanced, and we need to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new solutions in a competitive, demanding and rapidly changing environment.




	To succeed in the intensely competitive IT industry, we must continually improve, refresh and expand our product and service offerings to include newer features, functionality, delivery options or solutions, and keep pace with price-to-performance gains in the IT industry. Shortened product life cycles due to customer demands and competitive pressures impact the pace at which we must introduce and implement new technology. This requires a high level of innovation by both our software developers and the suppliers of the third-party software components included in our systems. In addition, bringing new solutions to the market entails a costly and lengthy process, and requires us to accurately anticipate customer needs and technology trends. We must continue to respond to market demands, develop leading technologies and maintain leadership in analytic data solutions performance and scalability, or our business operations may be adversely affected.




	We must also anticipate and respond to customer demands regarding the compatibility of our current and prior offerings. These demands could hinder the pace of introducing and implementing new technology. Our future results may be affected if our products cannot effectively interface and perform well with software products of other companies and with our customers’ existing IT infrastructures, or if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to enter into agreements allowing integration of third-party technology with the Teradata database and software platforms. Our efforts to develop the interoperability of our products may require significant investments of capital and employee resources. In addition, many of our principal products are used with products offered by third parties and, in the future, some vendors of non-Teradata products may become less willing to provide us with access to their products, technical information and marketing and sales support.

	Table of Contents









	As a result of these and other factors, our ability to introduce new or improved solutions could be adversely impacted. There can be no assurance that our innovations will be profitable, and if we cannot successfully market and sell both existing and newly developed solutions, our business and operating results could be impacted. If we were to lose our significant technology advantage, our market share and growth could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to deliver products, features, and functionality as projected, we may be unable to meet our commitments to customers, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.




	Highly Advanced Products-Our products include highly advanced technology, and as we develop new products with greater capacity and performance capabilities, the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability problems.




	Despite rigorous testing prior to their release and well-designed quality processes, our software and hardware products may contain undetected errors or security flaws, which may be found after the products are introduced and shipped. This risk is enhanced when products are first introduced or when new versions are released, as well as when we develop products with more advanced technology, since the increased difficulty and complexity associated with producing these products increases the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability problems. The correction and detection of errors may cause delays, lost revenues and incremental costs. Errors in our software products could also affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products. While we attempt to remedy errors that we believe would be considered critical by our customers prior to shipment, we may not be able to detect or remedy all such errors.




	Our customers who rely on our solutions for business-critical applications are more sensitive to product errors, which could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims, as well as harm our reputation. These and other risks associated with new product and service offerings may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and future performance.




	Product introductions and certain enhancements of existing products by us in future periods may also reduce demand for our existing products or could delay purchases by customers awaiting arrival of our new products. As new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products.




	In the ordinary course of business, we continually evaluate opportunities for new product and service offerings, new markets and new geographic sectors, and development of such opportunities could entail certain business risks which could affect our financial condition. In addition, due to the complexity of many of our offerings, we may not be able to meet customer requirements with respect to consulting services without incurring costs greater than expected levels.




	Information Systems and Security-A breach of security, disruption or failure of our information systems or those of our third party providers could adversely impact our business and financial results.




	Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases (and the computer equipment and database information of certain suppliers and other third parties) from damage by, among other things, earthquake, fire, natural disaster, cyber-attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusions, malicious or unintended insider actions that cause loss of data or loss of systems, and other events. Despite our contingency planning, events of this nature may still result in system failures and other interruptions in our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.




	We generally operate pursuant to a business-to-business model, such that our customers buy or lease hardware systems used in connection with our solutions and the customers deploy and operate those solutions. With respect to these kinds of customer on-premises solutions, the customer, directly or through its selected services providers, manages all aspects of the data controls and security with respect to any confidential, private or otherwise sensitive information stored or processed through these solutions, including any personally identifiable data or information - such as non-public data regarding our customers’ employees, customer’s customers, consumers, data subjects, individuals’ identities, individual financial accounts and health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. However, some of our services, including our software as a service or cloud offerings, may require us to deploy or operate solutions for our customers, directly or through the use of third








	18









	Table of Contents









	party services providers, either on-premises at customer-selected data center facilities or at third-party-hosted data center facilities selected by us. With respect to these kinds of cloud and non-traditional solution deployments and operations, we and such service providers have increased roles, responsibilities and risk exposures regarding some or all aspects of the data controls and security with respect to any confidential, private or otherwise sensitive information stored or processed through these solutions on our systems or those of selected third-party providers. If unauthorized access to or use of such information or systems occurs, despite data security measures and third party commitments to protect them, our results of operation, reputation, and relationships with our customers could be adversely impacted.




	Additionally, experienced computer programmers, Nation State Sponsored Advanced Persistent Code (“NSSAPC”) attacks (from countries such as Iran, China and certain European Eastern Bloc countries) and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or that of our third party providers and misappropriate or compromise our intellectual property or other confidential information or that of our customers, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. We have reason to believe that at least one attempted NSSAPC cyber-attack occurred against our systems in 2012, although we do not believe that it was successful or that there was any adverse impact to the Company in connection with the incident. Despite the fact that our preventative and remediation tools and actions may have mitigated or preempted this attack, we have since taken additional steps designed to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems; however, there can be no assurance that our defensive measures will be adequate to prevent them in the future. Also, like many other companies, our workstations are regularly subject to penetration attempts and malicious threats by hackers and, despite our defensive measures, we may not always be able to detect, mitigate or preempt them all. Breaches of security and disruptions of our information systems have not historically had a material impact on our results of operations and we have no reason to believe that attempts by hackers such as those described above have negatively impacted our IT infrastructure, operations, confidential information or intellectual property. However, there is risk that these types of activities will recur and persist, that one or more of them may be successful in the future, that one or more of them may have been or will be successful but not detected, prevented, remediated or mitigated by us, and the costs to us to eliminate, detect, prevent, remediate, mitigate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could adversely impact our future results of operations.




	Reliance on Third Parties-Our future results depend in part on our relationships with key suppliers, strategic partners and other third parties.




	Our development, marketing and distribution strategies depend in part on our ability to form strategic alliances with third parties that have complementary products, software, services and skills. Our strategic partners include consultants and system integrators, software and technology providers, and indirect channel distributors in certain countries. These relationships create risks beyond our control of our partners changing their business focus, entering into strategic alliance with other companies, being acquired by our competitors, failing to meet performance criteria or improperly using our confidential information. If we fail to maintain or expand our relationships with strategic partners, our business may be adversely affected.




	Third-party vendors provide important elements to our solutions; if we do not maintain our relationships with these vendors or if these vendors cease to be going concerns, interruptions in the supply of our products may result. There are some components of our solutions that we purchase from single sources due to price, quality, technology or other reasons. For example, we have relied on Flextronics as a key single source contract manufacturer for our hardware systems for the last several years. In addition, we buy silicon computer chips and microprocessors from Intel Corporation, and storage disk systems from NetApp, Inc. Some components supplied by third parties may be critical to our solutions, and several of our suppliers may terminate their agreements with us without cause with 180 days notice. If we were unable to purchase necessary services, parts, components or products from a particular vendor and had to find an alternative supplier, our shipments and deliveries could be delayed. Also, disruption in our supply chain or the need to find alternative suppliers could impact the costs and/or timing associated with procuring necessary products, components and services. In either case, our operations could be adversely impacted. Similarly, our suppliers’ products and services have certain dependencies with respect to their own supply chain networks, and supply issues among our suppliers’ suppliers may also adversely impact our business.

	Table of Contents









	In addition, smaller suppliers have operating risks that could impact our business. These risks could create product time delays, inventory and invoicing problems, staging delays, and other operational difficulties. We could also be impacted by their inability to provide high-quality products or services that conform to required specifications or contractual arrangements, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.




	Reliance on the Intellectual Property of Third Parties-The loss of our rights to use software licensed to us by third parties could harm our business.




	We have an active partner program that offers rights to sublicense third party software as part of a complete suite of solutions for our customers. This offering, as well as our reliance on third party software and licenses in our operating system software and business, creates risks that are not present when developing software in-house. For example, the viability, reliability and quality of such partners’ businesses, as well as their ability to fulfill their obligations to us, are factors that come into play and could adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations could also be impacted if we are forced to seek alternative technology, or technology for new solutions, that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Also, many of our offerings are complemented by technologies developed by others, and if we are unable to continue to obtain licenses for such technologies at competitive prices, our business could be impacted.




	Intellectual Property-If we are unable to develop, preserve and protect our intellectual property assets, our operating results may be adversely affected.




	As a technology company, our intellectual property portfolio is crucial to our continuing ability to be a leading analytic solutions provider. We strive to protect and enhance our proprietary intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as through technological safeguards. These efforts include protection of the products and application, diagnostic and other software we develop.




	To the extent we are not successful our business could be materially adversely impacted. We may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology without our authorization or independently developing technology that is similar to ours, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. (such as Iran, China and certain European Eastern Bloc countries who may use NSSAPC to advance their own industries). With respect to our pending patent applications, we may not be successful in securing patents for these claims, and our competitors may already have applied for patents that, once issued, will prevail over our patent rights or otherwise limit our ability to sell our products.




	While we take steps to provide for confidentiality obligations of employees and third parties with whom we do business (including customers, suppliers and strategic partners), there is a risk that such parties will breach such obligations and jeopardize our intellectual property rights. Many customers have outsourced the administration and management of their data warehouses to third parties, including some of our competitors, who then have access to our confidential information. Although we have agreements in place to mitigate this risk, there can be no assurance that such protections will be sufficient. In addition, our ability to capture and re-use field-based developed intellectual property is important to future business opportunities and margins.




	We are actively engaged in efforts to protect the value of our intellectual property and to prevent others from infringing our intellectual property rights. However, due to the complex and technical nature of such efforts and the potentially high stakes involved, such enforcement activity can be expensive and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.




	Research and Development-We make significant investments in research and development and cannot assure that these investments will be profitable.




	As part of our business strategy, we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts in order to maintain and advance our competitive position, including our initiatives to provide our offerings for cloud environments. However, we may not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all. Research and development expenses represent a significant portion of our discretionary fixed costs. We believe these new technologies could significantly improve our products and services over the long-term. However, if we have invested inappropriately, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

	Intellectual Property Infringement Claims by Third Parties-Claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and financial condition.




	We have seen a trend towards aggressive enforcement of intellectual property rights as the functionality of products in our industry increasingly overlaps and the volume of issued software patents continues to grow. As a result, there is a risk that we could be subject to infringement claims which, regardless of their validity, could:













	•






	Be expensive, time consuming and divert management attention away from normal business operations;
















	•






	Require us to pay monetary damages or enter into non-standard royalty and licensing agreements;
















	•






	Require us to modify our product sales and development plans; or
















	•






	Require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers.







	Regardless of whether these claims have any merit, they can be burdensome to defend or settle and can harm our business and reputation.




	Open Source Software-The growing market acceptance of open source software and lower cost alternatives present challenges for our industry.




	We have developed a version of the Teradata database software to operate on open source and alternative platforms and have incorporated other types of open source software into our products, allowing us to enhance certain solutions without incurring substantial additional research and development costs and expand our solution offerings. “Open source” software is made widely available by its authors and is licensed for a nominal fee or, in some cases, at no charge.




	Open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary software, when combined in specific ways with open source software, becomes subject to the open source license. We take steps to ensure that our proprietary software is not combined with, or does not incorporate, open source software in ways that would require our proprietary software to be subject to an open source license. However, few courts have interpreted the open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to uncertainty.




	Additionally, there are certain open source software applications in the data analytics market that are being offered free of charge or for a nominal fee. Open source software offerings available in the marketplace such as Hadoop and others, can place additional competitive pressure on Teradata, even though we believe our offerings are unique and add value through software enhancements and services, and we may have difficulty in marketing our products to certain customers against available open source options.




	International Operations-Generating substantial revenues from our multinational operations helps us to meet our strategic goals, but poses a number of risks.




	In 2016, the percentage of our total revenues from outside of the U.S. was 46%. We believe that our geographic diversity may help to mitigate some risks associated with geographic concentrations of operations (


	e.g.


	, adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and deteriorating economic environments or business disruptions due to economic or political uncertainties). However, our ability to sell our solutions internationally is subject to the following risks, among others:













	•






	General economic and political conditions in each country that could adversely affect demand for our solutions in these markets;
















	•






	Currency exchange rate fluctuations that could result in lower demand for our products as well as generate currency translation losses;
















	•






	The impact of civil and political unrest (relating to war, terrorist activity or other turmoil) on the economy or markets in general, or on our ability, or that of our suppliers, to meet commitments, which may occur in other countries where we have significant operations;
















	•






	Changes to and compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations that may increase our cost of doing business in these markets or otherwise prevent us from effectively competing in these markets;
















	•






	Cultural and management challenges with managing new and growing consulting services and engineering functions overseas in developing countries;
















	•






	Difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;

	•






	Longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;
















	•






	Tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment;
















	•






	Costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages;

	The impact of catastrophic weather or other negative effects of climate change on our facilities, operations and/or workforce, as well as those of our customers, supply chains and distribution channels, throughout the world, particularly those in coastal areas; and

	Changing competitive requirements and deliverables in developing and emerging markets.







	Our products are subject to U.S. export controls and, when exported from the U.S., or re-exported to another country, must be authorized under applicable U.S. export regulations. Changes in our products or changes in export regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products to certain countries or customers altogether. Any change in export regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by these regulations could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations.




	Foreign Currency-Our revenue and operating income are subject to variability due to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.




	We have exposure to more than 30 functional currencies. The primary foreign currencies to which we are exposed include the euro, British pound, Japanese yen, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and other Asian and South American currencies. A significant portion of our revenue and operating income is generated outside the U.S., and therefore our financial results may fluctuate due to the effects of such foreign currency fluctuations, which are difficult to predict. For example, in the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, Teradata sales into such countries, or into Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established. In addition, currency variations can affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the U.S.

	On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (the “E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit”. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the E.U. The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our operating results. The announcement of Brexit may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets on our products and services. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.




	Dependence on Key Employees-We depend on key employees and face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.




	Our employees are critical to our success. Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain the services of senior management and key personnel in all functional areas of our company, including engineering and development, marketing and sales professionals, and consultants. Competition for highly skilled personnel in the IT industry is intense. No assurance can be made that key personnel will remain with us, and it may be difficult and costly to replace such employees. Our failure to hire, retain and replace our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business operations.




	Internal Controls-Inadequate internal control over financial reporting and accounting practices could lead to errors, which could adversely impact our ability to assure timely and accurate financial reporting.








	22









	Table of Contents









	Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives will be met. These inherent limitations include system errors, the potential for human error and unauthorized actions of employees or contractors, inadequacy of controls, temporary lapses in controls due to shortfalls in transition planning and oversight or resources, and other factors. Consequently, such controls may not prevent or detect misstatements in our reported financial results as required under SEC and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) rules, which could increase our operating costs or impair our ability to operate our business. Controls may also become inadequate due to changes in circumstances, and it is necessary to replace, upgrade or modify our internal information systems from time to time. In addition, unforeseen risks may arise in connection with financial reporting systems due to inefficient business processes, business process reengineering projects, or changes in accounting standards.




	If management is not successful in maintaining a strong internal control environment, material weaknesses could occur, causing investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could lead to a decline in our stock price, limit our ability to access the capital markets in the future, and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.




	Legal Contingencies and Regulatory Matters-Like other technology companies, we face uncertainties with regard to lawsuits, regulations and other related matters.




	In the normal course of business, we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, claims and other matters, including those that relate to the environment, health and safety, employee benefits, export compliance, intellectual property, and other regulatory compliance and general matters. See “Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report. Because such matters are subject to many uncertainties, their outcomes are not predictable. While we believe that amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are currently adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities, there can be no assurances that the amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from such matters will not impact future operating results.




	In addition, we are subject to diverse and complex laws and regulations, including those relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and reporting, which are rapidly changing and subject to many possible changes in the future. From time to time, we may conduct internal investigations in connection with our efforts to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations, the costs or results of which could impact our financial results. In addition, we may be subject to unexpected costs in connection with new public disclosure or other regulatory requirements that are issued from time to time. Laws and regulations impacting our customers, such as those relating to privacy, data protection and digital marketing, could also impact our future business. Because we do business in the government sector, we are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil or criminal fines, penalties or administrative sanctions, including debarment from future government business, which could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.




	In addition, our facilities and operations, including former facilities and former operations for which we may have liabilities, are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws. There have not been any known actual material effects that compliance with environmental provisions has had upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company or its subsidiaries, and there are no material estimated capital expenditures for environmental remediation or liabilities planned. However, we do expect to incur some costs in connection with compliance with these matters and given the uncertainties inherent in such activities, there can be no assurances that the costs required to comply with applicable environmental laws will not adversely impact future operating results.




	There is active enforcement and ongoing focus by the SEC and other governmental authorities on the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (the “Bribery Act”) and similar anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws in other countries. Given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees, despite our high ethics, governance and compliance standards, which could put the Company at risk regarding possible violations of such laws, including the FCPA or the Bribery Act.




	Management time and resources are spent to understand and comply with changing laws, regulations and standards relating to such matters as corporate governance, accounting principles, public disclosure (including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), SEC regulations, Basel III and the rules of the NYSE where our shares are listed. Although we








	23









	Table of Contents









	do not believe that recent regulatory and legal initiatives will result in significant changes to our internal practices or our operations, rapid changes in accounting standards, and federal securities laws and regulations, among others, may substantially increase costs to our organization, challenge our ability to timely comply with all of them and could have an impact on our future operating results.




	Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our financial flexibility.


	 




	The Company's indebtedness could:













	•






	expose us to interest rate risk since our indebtedness is at variable rates;
















	•






	increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
















	•






	limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing at attractive rates;
















	•






	require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes;
















	•






	limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; and
















	•






	place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt. 







	Further, our outstanding indebtedness is subject to financial and other covenants, which may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control. If we fail to comply with the covenants under any of our indebtedness, we may be in default under the loan, which may entitle the lenders to accelerate the debt obligations. In order to avoid defaulting on our indebtedness, we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing or eliminating stock repurchases, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital, any of which may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all.

	Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchases




	For the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company executed purchases of approximately 3 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of


	$24.25


	 under the two share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors in 2008. The first program (the “dilution offset program”) authorizes the Company to repurchase Teradata common stock to the extent of cash received from the exercise of stock options and under the Teradata Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to offset dilution from shares issued pursuant to these plans. On February 6, 2012, the board approved a new $300 million share repurchase authorization to replace a prior $300 million authorization under the Company’s second share repurchase program (the “general share repurchase program”), that was to expire on February 10, 2012. Since February 2012, Teradata’s Board of Directors has approved, in $300 million increments, additional share repurchase authorizations for a total of $2.0 billion under the Company’s general share repurchase program on each of the following dates: December 10, 2012, October 14, 2013, May 5, 2014, December 18, 2014, and May 4, 2015. An additional share repurchase authorization of $500 million was approved by the board in August 20, 2015. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had $512 million of authorization remaining to repurchase outstanding shares of Teradata common stock under the general share repurchase program. Share repurchases made by the Company are reported on a trade date basis.




	In addition to the share repurchase programs, Section 16 officers occasionally transfer vested shares of restricted stock to the Company at the current market price to cover their withholding taxes. For the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, the total of these purchases was 30,411 shares at an average price of $25.74 per share.

	2016 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW




	As more fully discussed in later sections of this MD&A, the following are the financial highlights for


	2016


	:













	•






	Revenue decreased 8% in


	2016


	 from


	2015


	 to


	$2,322 million


	. The year-over-year revenue comparison was negatively impacted by 1 percentage point from foreign currency fluctuations and the sale of the marketing applications business in 2016.
















	•






	Gross margin was


	51.2%


	 in


	2016


	, up from


	50.4%


	 in


	2015


	, which was largely due to improved deal mix and product mix.
















	•






	Operating income was


	$232 million


	 in


	2016


	, up from operating loss of


	$(195) million


	 in


	2015


	. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to more significant impairments of goodwill and acquired intangibles in 2015 than 2016, as well as a decrease in operating expenses.
















	•






	Net income of


	$125 million


	 in


	2016


	 versus a net loss of


	$(214) million


	 in


	2015


	. Net income per diluted share was


	$0.95


	 in


	2016


	 compared to net loss per common share of


	$(1.53)


	 in


	2015


	. Net income for


	2016


	 includes a $70 million after-tax impairment loss for goodwill and acquired intangibles, approximately $47 million in after-tax impacts of acquisition-related transaction, integration and reorganization expenses, and amortization of acquired intangible assets, compared to


	$502 million


	 of such costs and expenses in


	2015

	STRATEGIC OVERVIEW




	Teradata’s strategy is based around our core belief that analytics and data unleash the potential of great companies. We empower companies to achieve high-impact business outcomes through scalable analytics on an agile data foundation. Through our focus on leading with business outcomes and a consultative approach, our goal is to serve as a trusted advisor to both the business and technical leaders in our customers’ organizations. Our business analytics solutions are ideally suited for the world’s largest companies who have the most complex analytics requirements and the need to scale.




	Our strategy is to provide a differentiated set of offerings to this target market through the following portfolio of solutions, including the following:













	•






	Hybrid Cloud


	: leading technology and services to deliver an analytic ecosystem deployed in a hybrid cloud architecture, including offerings such as managed cloud, private cloud, public cloud, and on premises software and hardware.
















	•






	Business Analytics Solutions


	: deliver high-value business outcomes realized by engaging with business users through solution-based selling that leverages analytic consulting and repeatable analytical intellectual property ("IP");
















	•






	Ecosystem Architecture Consulting


	: best-in-class architecture consulting expertise to help customers build optimized analytical ecosystems independent of technology, leveraging both open source and commercial solutions; and







	We deliver our solutions on-premises, via the cloud, and "as a service"; offering customers choice in how they deploy a Teradata analytics environment and leverage the power of our solutions. These flexible delivery options are designed to extend our market opportunity.




	In support of our strategy, we plan to optimize our go-to-market and sales approach to improve effectiveness in demand creation and address new and expanded market opportunities, such as with our consultative business solutions and cloud offerings. We will continue investing in partnerships to increase the number of solutions available on Teradata platforms, maximize customer value, and increase our market coverage.




	We believe that our more consultative, solution-selling approach and portfolio of offerings that support customers’ choice in procuring and deploying analytics will best position us to be our customers’ trusted advisor and partner of choice for architecting, implementing, and managing their analytic solutions.




	In summary, our long-term strategic objectives are to:













	•






	deliver business outcomes for our customers through technology-enabled analytics at scale,
















	•






	by focusing on companies with the largest analytic opportunities,
















	•






	by offering market-leading hybrid cloud technology,
















	•






	that is enabled by a world class go-to-market sales and support team,
















	•






	with the ultimate goal of generating revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth.
















	FUTURE TRENDS









	We believe that future demand for our analytic solutions will increase based on the growth of new, high volume data sources such as sensor and machine-generated data, and based on data and analytics enabled use cases in areas such as seismic/exploration, genomics and biological research, connected cars, and smart cities.









	Analytic environments are becoming more complex to design and manage as there are increasing types of analytic tools and techniques, multiple data management systems both on-premises and in the cloud, commercial and open source technologies to be integrated, varying service level requirements, and the growth and volume of data. This








	29









	Table of Contents









	complexity drives the need for an overall architecture to manage such environments. Demand for value-added consulting and services is growing as customers seek help with evolving their analytic architectures, rapidly deploying their analytic architectural solutions, and increasingly look to purchase analytic capabilities “as a service".









	Overall, analytics are growing in importance as global businesses seek new means to drive business value from the ever-increasing amounts and types of data. As a result, we expect that Teradata’s leadership status and investments in our strategic areas of focus will position us for future growth.









	This growth, however, is not expected to be without its challenges from general economic conditions, competitive pressures, alternative technologies, and other risks and uncertainties. Over the past few years, we have seen a shift in the market that included a reduction in customers’ large capital investments in traditional data analytic systems and related services. Specifically, customers have been focusing investments in their analytical ecosystems on products which have lower average selling prices than traditional integrated data warehouse ("IDW") environments, and changing their buying behavior with decisions shifting from IT to business users who typically want operating expense purchasing options. As a result, our revenue has been impacted by our customers’ focus on less capital intensive options like cloud, subscription-based licenses, rental and usage-based models. In addition, an increasing percentage of our customers want to buy easy-to-use, vendor managed, on-line delivery “as-a-service” analytics rather than analytic systems. Currently, we believe that the greatest challenge for future revenue growth relates to our ability to adapt and respond to this market shift with respect to the way customers want to purchase and deploy analytic technologies.









	Overall, we believe that the IDW will remain a critical part of companies’ analytical ecosystems and Teradata’s technology is highly differentiated with our ability to handle the concurrency and service level agreements of hundreds to thousands of mission-critical users and applications. Further, we believe the Company has the opportunity for continued revenue growth from both the expansion of our existing customers’ analytical ecosystems as well as the addition of new customers. Teradata has expanded our offerings as well as our pricing options to make it easier for customers to buy and expand with Teradata including flexible offerings including availability in the cloud and over time pricing programs.









	There is risk that pricing and competitive pressures on our solutions could increase in the future as major customers evaluate and rationalize their analytics infrastructure, particularly to the extent that cost becomes the top focus and lower-cost/lower performing alternatives are more seriously and frequently considered. However, such alternatives generally do not enable companies to perform mission-critical, complex analytic workloads to address customer's needed business outcomes from large-scale analytics, discovery analytics, and data management such as those enabled by Teradata’s portfolio of offerings. As the market continues to evolve, we will be challenged to generate revenue growth shorter term as customers purchase in smaller deal sizes, and more of our customers shift from upfront perpetual licenses to over time models at a pace which is difficult to predict.









	As described above, we are also transforming our go-to-market approach to better position Teradata with both business buyers and IT buyers, and to expand with our existing customers as well as add more customers. To meet this objective, we will focus on execution and monitoring our progress with respect to this evolution, as well as working to infuse talent into our organization with key skill sets to support our strategy. We continue to believe that analytics will remain a high priority for companies and longer term will drive growth for Teradata’s leading solutions. Moreover, we continue to be committed to new product development and achieving a positive yield from our research and development spending and resources, which are intended to drive future demand. In addition, we will continue to optimize our go-to-market structure to focus on the greatest analytic opportunities, and to manage our cost structure as we work to broaden our product and consulting services portfolios and market penetration.









	As a portion of the Company’s operations and revenue occur outside the United States ("U.S."), and in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Based on currency rates as of January 31, 2017, Teradata is expecting one point of negative impact from currency translation on our full year projected revenue growth rate.

	BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION




	Teradata continues to advance in the execution of its business transformation plan to return the Company to profitable growth. As described above, we are strengthening our consultative approach to selling data analytics that enable high-impact business outcomes for our customers and extend our portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions. We are also realigning our go-to-market approach to improve sales effectiveness and achieve better financial results. We will continue to invest and prioritize initiatives that strengthen our ability to be our customers’ trusted advisor for data and analytics.




	In addition, our broad-reaching transformation is intended to drive change across our Company, including in the following key areas:













	•






	Cloud - We plan to continue to expand our data warehouse offerings in the public cloud and in Teradata’s managed cloud environments. With our "Teradata Everywhere" initiative, we offer our customers greater flexibility and agility through the same Teradata database that we offer on premises, now in a managed cloud, public cloud, or private cloud environment. Teradata Everywhere is designed to speed time to value, save costs, and encourage analytics use throughout the organization. We are building new services for cloud migration as well as for design, implementation and management of cloud and hybrid cloud environments.
















	•






	On-premises data warehouse - We have introduced methods to make it easier to buy, expand, and seamlessly upgrade data warehouses. We expect that our IntelliFlex platform architecture, released in early 2016, will provide more flexible configurations and seamless expansions of our customers’ IDW environments, and that the software-only version of our Teradata database will allow us to expand with both new and existing customers.
















	•






	Analytical ecosystem - We are adding to our data load and integration software and service offerings capabilities that manage customers' analytical ecosystems with new products such as Teradata UnityTM, QueryGridTM, and ListenerTM. These offerings help connect and manage the customers' ecosystems to help manage and extract value from their data.







	We expect the mix of our revenues to shift toward cloud, analytical ecosystem, and analytic consulting services over time, as these are faster growing markets, which we believe will help increase our recurring revenue over time.




	Another element that is critical to Teradata's successful transformation plan is modifying our go-to-market efforts to a more consultative approach to better address the increasing relevance of business buyers and to help customers build analytical ecosystems that include our own technologies as well as open source and other commercial solutions. We have actions underway to adjust our go-to-market efforts to address these new approaches and to align with the way we believe that our customers want to buy data analytics solutions.




	We have reviewed and rationalized the Company's expense structure and are now moving from a cost reduction initiative to a cost management approach as we invest for Teradata’s future, including investments to support our cloud-based initiatives, analytical solutions, realignment of our go-to-market approach, and modernizing our infrastructure.




	One of Teradata’s key strategic initiatives is to enable analytics for companies by making it easier to buy and easier to grow from traditional on-premises deployments to hybrid cloud solutions. These hybrid solutions offer simplified and consistent approaches with operating expense alternatives in addition to traditional capital intensive outlays. This strategy should accelerate our move away from traditional, upfront revenue sales and deployment models to a model where revenue is recognized over time. As a result, the Company’s revenue could decline in the short-term as customers transition to these purchasing models. Therefore, Teradata is introducing additional financial and performance measures to allow for greater transparency regarding the progress we are making toward achieving our strategic objectives. These new financial and performance measures currently include the following:













	•






	TCORE Growth


	 - a measure of consumption of the Teradata database solution. It is based on the performance of a system as calculated by number of cores reduced by an input/output ("I/O") factor, recognizing that an I/O starved central processing unit ("CPU") will not provide optimum performance.  











	31









	Table of Contents


















	•






	Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)


	 - is the annual value at a point in time of all of our recurring contracts, including support, software upgrade rights, subscription licenses, rental and cloud.
















	•






	Recurring Revenue as a % of Total Revenue


	 - revenue from all recurring contracts, including support, software upgrade rights, subscription licenses, rental and cloud divided by total Company revenue.
















	•






	Business Consulting Revenue Growth


	 - revenue growth from our strategic service offerings around Analytics Consulting, Business Consulting, and Ecosystem Architecture consulting. Although the revenue from Business Consulting represents a small percent of total Company revenue, it is a leading indicator of future TCORE growth and measures our effectiveness of becoming a “Trusted Advisor” within our customers and targeted prospects.

	Total revenue decreased 8% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The revenue decrease included a 1% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The revenue decline was primarily due to customers increasingly opting for subscription-based (term) licenses, rental of hardware, and cloud adoption. This has an impact on the amount of revenue that is booked upfront versus over the term of the contract. In addition, the sale of the marketing applications business, which generated $69 million in revenue in 2016 (before the sale on July 1, 2016) compared to $153 million in 2015, had a negative impact on total revenue of 3%. Product revenue decreased 16% in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to customers increasingly opting for our subscription-based purchase options. Service revenue decreased 3% in 2016 from 2015, with an underlying 6% decrease in consulting services revenue and 1% increase in maintenance services revenue compared to 2015. Services revenue declined primarily due to the sale of the marketing applications business on July 1, 2016 and foreign currency fluctuations, which had a 2% adverse impact on services revenue.




	In 2015, total revenue decreased 7% as compared to 2014. The revenue decrease included a 5% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The revenue decline was due primarily to constrained information technology budgets, extended sales cycles, and a reduction in large customer orders, as well as the impact currency translation had on reported revenue growth. Product revenue decreased 14% in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to a decrease in customers' large capital expenditures and foreign currency fluctuations, which had a 5% adverse impact on product revenue. Service revenue decreased 2% in 2015 from 2014, with an underlying 5% decrease in consulting services revenue and 1% increase in maintenance services revenue compared to 2014. Services revenue declined due to foreign currency fluctuations, which had a 6% adverse impact on services revenue.




	Gross Margin




	The Company often uses specific terms/definitions to describe variances in gross margin. The terms and definitions most often used are as follows:













	•






	Revenue Mix


	 - The proportion of products and services that generates the total revenue of the Company. Changes in revenue mix can have an impact on gross margin even if total revenue remains unchanged.
















	•






	Services Mix


	 - The proportion of higher-margin maintenance revenue versus lower-margin consulting revenue that generates the total services revenue of the Company.
















	•






	Product Mix


	 - The proportion of various products that generate the total product revenue of the Company. For example, a higher mix of IDW products versus departmental data mart, Aster, our Extreme Data











	32









	Table of Contents









	Appliance or Hadoop products would have a positive impact on product gross margins. This definition also includes the mix of Company sourced and third party products.













	•






	Deal Mix -


	Refers to the type of transactions closed within the period and includes such transactions as capacity on demand (“COD”), floor sweeps versus capacity additions, enterprise license agreements ("ELA"), hardware versus software, and discounting (new customers versus existing customers, large customers versus smaller customers).


















	◦






	COD


	is a common offering used by Teradata and other information technology vendors that allows the customer to purchase extra capacity in the future, which is already delivered and integrated into their existing systems, typically within 12-18 months. COD enables customers to "activate" or add capacity quickly. Product cost is recognized upon delivery with no corresponding revenue. When customers activate the COD, we record and recognize the revenue associated with the added capacity and the gross margin is recovered.
















	◦






	Floor sweeps


	take place when an existing customer replaces their older Teradata platform with a new Teradata platform, which can result in a large revenue transaction, but typically also results in a higher mix of lower-margin hardware revenue versus higher-margin software revenue.
















	◦






	ELA


	 transactions allow customers to purchase as much software as needed for current production use for a period of time in exchange for a fixed fee that is typically recognized as revenue upfront or as payments become due if the terms of the payments are extended. Additional capacity during the term results in lower-margin hardware revenue versus higher-margin software revenue.

	In 2016, product margin increased 2% points due to favorable deal and product mix. Service gross margin improved 1% points driven by the exiting of the marketing applications business which had a lower service margin rate than the Data and Analytics service rate.




	In 2015, product margin declined 5.5% points due to deal mix (including a higher mix of hardware versus software deals as well as pricing programs that are intended to make it easier to buy Teradata), foreign currency, a lower mix of integrated data warehousing products and a reduction in product volume. Service gross margin declined 1.5% points due to investments in our big data consulting capabilities, the marketing applications business (prior to the decision to exit this business), and investments in our Teradata cloud capabilities.

	In 2016, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense decreased by $101 million or 13% compared to 2015. The decrease is


	driven by the exit of the marketing applications business and cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by higher annual incentive payment accruals.




	Research and development ("R&D") expenses decreased $16 million or 7% in 2016 due to the exit of the marketing applications business and cost reduction initiatives partially offset by additional spending for strategic initiatives including further investment in our managed and public cloud offerings, Teradata software-only and our Intelliflex platform.




	In 2015, SG&A expense decreased by $5 million or 1% compared to 2014. The decrease is a result of the change in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased investments in demand creation resulting from our strategic investment initiatives. R&D expenses increased $22 million or 11% in 2015 due to additional investments in big data analytics, cloud and marketing applications, which included incremental expenses from acquisitions. The increase in R&D expense was also caused by a decrease in capitalized software of $7 million compared to 2014.




	The Company recognized an impairment of goodwill of $57 million and acquired intangibles of $19 million in 2016 to adjust the marketing applications business, which was sold on July 1, 2016, to its fair value less cost to sell. In addition, the Company recorded a $4 million impairment charge related to the sale of its corporate plane. The Company recorded a goodwill impairment of $437 million and an impairment of acquired intangibles of $41 million in 2015, also related to the marketing applications business (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

	In


	2016, other expense included a foreign exchange loss of $9 million related to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. The increase in interest expense and interest income compared to 2015 was due to an increase in interest rates.


	In


	2015, other income primarily included a gain of $57 million from sale of equity investments. This was partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to an increase in debt. In 2014, other expense primarily included a loss of $9 million on an equity investment arising from an impairment of carrying value.

	Income Taxes




	The effective income tax rate for the following years ended December 31 was as follows:

	(48.6






	)%






	 






	25.7






	%









	The 2016 effective tax rate was impacted by the $57 million of goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016, all of which were treated as a permanent non-deductible tax item. In addition, a discrete tax charge of $22 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2016 for the tax impact of the sale of the marketing applications business, which occurred on July 1, 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded $8 million of tax expense associated with the issuance of new U.S. Treasury Regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 987 on December 7, 2016, which clarified how companies calculate foreign currency translation gains and losses for income tax purposes for branches whose accounting records are kept in a currency other than the currency of the company. Also in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. As a result, the Company incurred a $5 million discrete tax expense associated with the net shortfall arising from 2016 equity compensation vestings and exercises.




	The 2015 effective tax rate was impacted by the $437 million of goodwill impairment charges recorded for 2015, of which $414 million was treated as a permanent non-deductible tax item. This resulted in full-year income tax expense in 2015 of $70 million, on a pre-tax net loss of $(144) million, causing a negative tax rate of 48.6%. There were no material discrete tax items impacting the effective tax rate for full year 2014.




	Revenue and Gross Margin by Operating Segment




	Effective January 1, 2016, Teradata implemented an organizational change in which it now manages the Company's business under two geographic regions and the marketing applications division (prior to its sale on July 1, 2016); which are also the Company’s operating segments: (1) Americas Data and Analytics (North America and Latin America); (2) International Data and Analytics (Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Japan); and (3) Marketing Applications. Effective July 1, 2016, following the sale of the marketing applications business, Teradata is managing its business in two operating segments: (1) Americas region (North America and Latin America); and (2) International region (Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Japan). For purposes of discussing results by segment, management excludes the impact of certain items, consistent with the manner by which management evaluates the performance of each segment. This format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends. It also includes the same information that is used by Teradata management to make decisions regarding the segments and to assess financial performance. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of the segments based on revenue and multiple profit measures, including segment gross margin. For management reporting purposes assets are not allocated to the segments. Our segment results are reconciled to total company results reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

	Americas Data and Analytics:


	 Revenue decreased 9% as customers continue to evaluate lower cost (and less capital intensive) alternatives as well as our new purchasing and deployment options. As discussed in the future trends section of this MD&A, the revenue decline was driven by our customers' focus on less capital intensive options like cloud, subscription licenses, rental and usage-based models, which results in revenue being recognized over time instead of upfront. Segment gross margins as a percentage of revenue were higher driven by an increase in product gross margin. The increase in the product gross margin was driven by favorable deal and product mix.




	In 2015, revenue was down 4% primarily driven by a decrease in customer large capital expenditure transactions. The results included a 2% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Gross margins as a percentage of revenue were down in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the high mix of hardware versus software deals and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.




	International Data and Analytics:


	 Revenue increased by 1%, which included a 2% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The revenue increase was led by good growth in Western Europe and China. Gross margins were down due to a higher mix of service revenue, which has a lower margin profile versus product revenue.




	In 2015, revenue was down 12%, which was almost entirely due to a 11% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuation. Gross margins were down due to lower revenue volume from foreign currency fluctuations and a higher mix of service revenue, which has a lower margin profile versus product revenue.




	Marketing Applications:


	Revenue decreased by $84 million or 55% in 2016 from 2015. The decline in revenue was driven by the divestiture of the marketing applications business on July 1, 2016. Prior to its divestiture, the overall segment gross margin increase was primarily driven by higher product and professional services margins. In 2015, the Company made investments to help better position the Company to go broader in the market, which resulted in lower service margins in 2015.




	In 2015, revenue decreased $11 million or 7% from 2014. The revenue decrease included a 6% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The overall gross margin decrease in 2015 from 2014 is primarily driven by investments in the cloud business as well as lower professional services margins, which were impacted by investments to help better position the Company to go broader in the market and drive long-term growth in this business.

	FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES




	Teradata ended 2016 with $


	974 million


	 in cash and cash equivalents, a $


	135 million


	 increase from the


	December 31, 2015


	 balance, after using approximately


	$82 million


	 for repurchases of Company common stock, and approximately $16 million for acquisitions and investment activities which were completed during the year. Cash provided by operating activities increased by


	$45 million


	 to


	$446 million


	 in


	2016


	. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to favorable changes in net working capital, primarily due to a larger collection of receivables as compared to the prior year.




	Teradata’s management uses a non-GAAP measure called “free cash flow,” which is not a measure defined under GAAP. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, and additions to capitalized software, as one measure of assessing the financial performance of the Company, and this may differ from the definition used by other companies. The components that are used to calculate free cash flow are GAAP measures taken directly from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We believe that free cash flow information is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the Company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash available after capital expenditures for, among other things, investments in the Company’s existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and repurchase of Teradata common stock. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, cash flows from operating activities under GAAP.




	The table below shows net cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures for the following periods:

	Financing activities and certain other investing activities are not included in our calculation of free cash flow. In


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, these other investing activities primarily consisted of immaterial complementary business acquisitions and equity investment activities that were closed during these years along with the sale of the marketing applications business on July 1, 2016.




	Teradata’s financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of cash outflows of


	$82 million


	 for share repurchases, repayments of credit facility borrowings of $180 million, repayment of existing term loan of $30 million and $30 million from other financing activities, net of tax paid for shares withheld upon equity award settlement. Teradata's financing activities for the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	 primarily consisted of cash outflows of $657 million for share repurchases, proceeds from credit facility borrowings of $180 million, repayments of credit facility borrowings of $220 million, and proceeds from a new term loan of $600 million and repayment of an existing term loan of $247 million. The Company purchased 3.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price per share of


	$24.25


	 in 2016, 19 million shares at an average price per share of $34.15 in 2015, and 13 million shares at an average price per share of $43.09 in 2014.




	Share repurchases were made under two share repurchase programs initially authorized by our Board of Directors in 2008. The first program (the “dilution offset program”) authorizes the Company to repurchase Teradata common stock to the extent of cash received from the exercise of stock options and the Teradata Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to offset dilution from shares issued pursuant to these plans. On February 6, 2012, the board approved a new $300 million share repurchase authorization to replace a prior $300 million authorization (the “general share repurchase program”), that was to expire on February 10, 2012. Since February 2012, Teradata’s Board of Directors has approved, in $300 million increments, additional share repurchase authorizations for a total of $2.0 billion under the Company’s general share repurchase program on each of the following dates: December

	Table of Contents









	10, 2012, October 14, 2013, May 5, 2014, December 18, 2014 and May 4, 2015. An additional share repurchase authorization of $500 million was approved by the board on August 20, 2015. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had $512 million of authorization remaining to repurchase outstanding shares of Teradata common stock under the general share repurchase program. Share repurchases made by the Company are reported on a trade date basis. Our share repurchase activity depends on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for capital investments, our stock price, and economic and market conditions, as well as merger and acquisition opportunities. Proceeds from the ESPP and the exercise of stock options were $31 million in 2016, $24 million in 2015 and $29 million in 2014. These proceeds are included in other financing activities, net in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.




	Our total cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. in various foreign subsidiaries was $957 million as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and $819 million as of


	December 31, 2015


	. The remaining balance held in the U.S. was $17 million as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and $20 million as of


	December 31, 2015


	. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. are distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and potential foreign withholding taxes. As of December 31, 2016, we have not provided for the U.S. federal tax liability on approximately


	$1.3 billion


	 of foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested outside of the U.S.




	On March 25, 2015, Teradata replaced its existing five-year, $300 million revolving credit facility with a new $400 million revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility ends on March 25, 2020 at which point any remaining outstanding borrowings would be due for repayment unless extended by agreement of the parties for up to two additional one-year periods. The interest rate charged on borrowings pursuant to the Credit Facility can vary depending on the interest rate option the Company chooses to utilize and the Company’s leverage ratio at the time of the borrowing. In


	2016


	, Teradata chose a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). The Credit Facility is unsecured and contains certain representations and warranties, conditions, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for such facilities. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on the Credit Facility, leaving


	$400 million


	 in additional borrowing capacity available. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Also on March 25, 2015, Teradata closed on a new senior unsecured $600 million five-year term loan, the proceeds of which were used to pay off the remaining $247 million of principal on its existing term loan, pay off the $220 million outstanding balance on the prior credit facility, and fund share repurchases. The $600 million term loan is payable in quarterly installments, which commenced on March 31, 2016, with all remaining principal due in March 2020. The outstanding principal amount under the term loan agreement bears interest at a floating rate based upon a negotiated base rate or a Eurodollar rate plus in each case a margin based on the leverage ratio of the Company. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the term loan principal outstanding was $570 million and carried an interest rate of 2.1875%. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2016.




	Management believes current cash, cash flows from operations and the $400 million available under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy future working capital, research and development activities, capital expenditures, pension contributions, severance benefits and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months. The Company principally holds its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposits and highly-rated money market funds.




	The Company’s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions, competitive pressures, and other business and risk factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or otherwise to comply with the terms of the credit facility and term loan agreement, the Company may be required to seek additional financing alternatives.

	. As of December 31, 2016, the




	Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, leaving $400 million in additional borrowing capacity available. Our lease obligations in the above table include Company facilities in various domestic and international locations. Purchase obligations are committed purchase orders and other contractual commitments for goods and services, and include non-cancelable contractual payments for fixed or minimum amounts to be purchased in relation to service agreements with various vendors for ongoing telecommunications, information technology, hosting and other services.




	Additionally, the Company has

	. These items are not included in the table of obligations shown above. The settlement period for the non-current income tax liabilities cannot be reasonably estimated as the timing and the amount of the payments, if any, will depend on possible future tax examinations with the various tax authorities. However, it is not expected that any payments will be due within the next


	12


	 months.




	We also have product warranties and guarantees to third parties, as well as postemployment and international pension obligations that may affect future cash flow. These items are not included in the table of obligations shown above. Product warranties and third-party guarantees are described in detail in “Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Postemployment and pension obligations are described in detail in “Note 6—Employee Benefit Plans” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.


	We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes.








	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES




	Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Our critical accounting policies are those that require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain. Different estimates could have a material impact on our financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances. Our management periodically reviews these estimates and assumptions to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and are materially correct.

	In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require significant management judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. The significant accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are discussed in the paragraphs below. Teradata’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of Teradata’s Board of Directors. For additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP, see “Note 1—Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.




	Revenue Recognition




	Revenue recognition for complex contractual arrangements requires judgment, including a review of specific contracts, past experience, creditworthiness of customers, international laws and other factors. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. We must also apply judgment in determining all deliverables of the arrangement, and in determining the relative selling price of each deliverable, considering the price charged for each product when sold on a standalone basis, and applicable renewal rates for services. Changes in judgments about these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized between periods.




	The Company reviews the relative selling price on a periodic basis and updates it, when appropriate, to ensure that the practices employed reflect the Company’s recent pricing experience. The Company maintains internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates, which includes review and approval by the Company’s management. For the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	 there was no material impact to revenue resulting from changes in the relative selling price, nor does the Company expect a material impact from such changes in the near term.




	Capitalized Software




	Costs incurred in researching and developing a computer software product that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established. Technological feasibility is established when planning, designing and initial coding activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications are complete. In the absence of a detailed program design or for agile development activities, a working model is used to establish technological feasibility. Once technological feasibility is established, all development costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. The timing of when various research and development projects become technologically feasible or ready for release can cause fluctuations in the amount of research and development costs that are expensed or capitalized in any given period, thus impacting our reported profitability for that period.




	In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company began moving towards more frequent releases of its products, which significantly shortens the opportunity to capitalize software development costs. Our research and development efforts have become more driven by market requirements and rapidly changing customers' needs. In addition, the Company started applying agile development methodologies to help respond to new technologies and trends. Agile development methodologies are characterized by a more dynamic development process with more frequent and iterative revisions to a product releases' features and functions as the software is being developed. Due to the shorter development cycle and focus on rapid production associated with agile development, the Company does not anticipate capitalizing significant amounts of external use software development costs in future periods due to the relatively short duration between the completion of the working model and the point at which a product is ready for general release. Prior capitalized costs will continue to be amortized under the greater of revenue-based or straight-line method over the estimated useful life.




	Income Taxes




	In accounting for income taxes, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities








	40









	Table of Contents









	are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.




	The Company’s intention is to permanently reinvest its foreign earnings outside of the U.S. As a result, the effective tax rates are largely based upon the pre-tax earnings mix and allocation of certain expenses in various taxing jurisdictions where the Company conducts its business. These jurisdictions apply a broad range of statutory income tax rates; the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate is currently 35% as compared to the overall statutory effective tax rate of our various foreign jurisdictions of approximately 12%. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company has not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of approximately


	$1.3 billion


	 from its foreign subsidiaries.




	We account for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing thresholds and attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We record any interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line on our Consolidated Statements of Income. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company has a total of $30 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which


	$20 million


	 is included in the other liabilities section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as a non-current liability. The remaining balance of $10 million of uncertain tax positions relates to certain tax attributes both generated by the Company and acquired in various acquisitions, which are netted against the underlying deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet.




	We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We recorded


	$26 million


	 in


	2016


	 and


	$25 million


	 in


	2015


	 for valuation allowances. Due to a change in tax law enacted in the state of California in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company established a valuation allowance to partially offset its California R&D tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset, as the Company expects to continue to generate excess California R&D tax credits into the foreseeable future.




	Stock-based Compensation




	We measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense over the service period for which awards are expected to vest. We utilize pricing models, including the Black-Scholes option pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation model, to estimate the fair value of stock-based compensation at the date of grant. These valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term. In addition, we issue performance-based awards that vest only if specific performance conditions are satisfied. The number of shares that will be earned can vary based on actual performance. No shares will vest if the threshold objectives are not met. In the event the objectives are exceeded, additional shares will vest up to a maximum payout. The cost of these awards is expensed over the performance period based upon management’s estimate and analysis of the probability of meeting the performance criteria. Because the actual number of shares to be awarded is not known until the end of the performance period, the actual compensation expense related to these awards could differ from our current expectations.




	Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets




	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company tests goodwill by first performing a qualitative analysis (Step 0) to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, and overall financial performance of the reporting unit. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying value after assessing these qualitative factors, then the guidance on goodwill impairment requires the company to perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company typically determines the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, the Company calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The market approach estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and








	41









	Table of Contents









	earnings derived from comparable companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. The implied fair value of the goodwill in step two analysis is determined by the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations which requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities and to allocate the fair value between net assets and goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference. Teradata reviewed two reporting units in its 2016 goodwill impairment assessment, as each operating segment was deemed as a reporting unit for purposes of testing. Based on the Company's evaluation and weighting of the events and circumstances that have occurred since the most recent Step 1 test, the Company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was below its carrying value. Therefore, the Company determined that it was not necessary to perform a Step 1 goodwill impairment test for the reporting units in 2016. See “Note 3—Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets" for additional information.




	The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the Company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate any excess purchase price consideration between net assets and goodwill. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets.




	Determining the fair value of goodwill and acquired intangibles is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates and future economic and market conditions. The company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which may not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.




	Pension and Postemployment Benefits




	We measure pension and postemployment benefit costs and credits using actuarial valuations. Actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability relating to these plans. These factors include assumptions we make about interest rates, expected investment return on plan assets, total and involuntary turnover rates, and rates of future compensation increases. In addition, our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop our valuations. We review and update these assumptions on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year. We are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. The actuarial assumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the measurement of our pension and postemployment benefit obligations, and to the amount of pension and postemployment benefits expense we have recorded or may record. For example, as of


	December 31, 2016


	, a one-half percent increase/decrease in the discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans by approximately $6 million, and a one-half percent increase/decrease in our involuntary turnover assumption would change our postemployment benefit obligation by approximately $11 million.








	RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS




	A discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements is described in “Note 1—Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report, and we incorporate such discussion by reference.

	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK









	The Company employs a foreign currency hedging strategy to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the Company’s functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. The primary currencies to which the Company is exposed include the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and other Asian and South American currencies. Exposures are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts with maturity dates of twelve months or less. The potential loss in fair value at December 31, 2016, for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately $2 million. This loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures. For additional information regarding the Company’s foreign currency hedging strategy, see “Note 7— Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report.

	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA















	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm









	To




	the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Teradata Corporation:




	In our opinion, the




	accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Teradata Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)






	presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in


	Internal Control - Integrated Framework


	 (


	2013


	) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.




	A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS








	Note 1 Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies




	Description of the Business.


	 Teradata Corporation (“Teradata” or the “Company”) is a global leader in analytic data platforms, analytic applications and related services. The Company’s analytic data platforms are comprised of software, hardware, and related business consulting and support services for data warehousing and big data analytics.




	Basis of Presentation.


	 The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).




	Use of Estimates.


	 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the period reported. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and judgments, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, the valuation of inventory to net realizable value, impairments of goodwill and other intangibles, stock-based compensation, pension and other postemployment benefits, and income taxes and any changes will be accounted for on a prospective basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	Revenue Recognition.


	 Teradata’s solution offerings typically include software, unspecified when-and-if-available upgrades, hardware, maintenance support services, and other consulting, implementation and installation-related (“consulting”) services. Teradata records revenue when it is realized, or realizable, and earned. Teradata considers these requirements met when:













	•






	Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
















	•






	The products or services have been delivered to the customer

	Teradata reports revenue net of any taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. The Company assesses whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale. Standard payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed, but are generally between


	30 days


	 and


	90


	 days. Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on a successful collection history on such arrangements, and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition. Teradata delivers its solutions primarily through direct sales channels, as well as through alliances with system integrators, other independent software vendors and distributors, and value-added resellers (collectively referred to as “resellers”). In assessing whether the sales price to a reseller is fixed or determinable, the Company considers, among other things, past business practices with the reseller, the reseller’s operating history, payment terms, return rights and the financial wherewithal of the reseller. When Teradata determines that the contract fee to a reseller is not fixed or determinable, that transaction is deferred and recognized upon sell-through to the end customer.




	The Company’s deliverables often involve delivery or performance at different periods of time. Revenue for software is generally recognized upon delivery with the hardware once title and risk of loss have been transferred. Revenue for unspecified upgrades or enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis are recognized straight-line over the term of the arrangement. Revenue for maintenance support services is also recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Revenue for other consulting, implementation and installation services is recognized as services are provided. In certain instances, acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer. In such cases, revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria have been met. Delivery and acceptance generally occur in the same reporting period. The Company’s arrangements generally do not include any customer negotiated provisions for cancellation, termination or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.




	The Company evaluates all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value, and if the contract








	50









	Table of Contents









	includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of Teradata. Most of the Company’s products and services qualify as separate units of accounting and are recognized upon meeting the criteria as described above.




	For multiple deliverable arrangements that contain non-software related deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based upon the relative selling price hierarchy and if software and software-related deliverables are also included in the arrangement, to those deliverables as a group based on the best estimate of selling price (“BESP”) for the group. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (“VSOE”) if available, third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) if VSOE is not available, or BESP if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company then recognizes revenue when the remaining revenue recognition criteria are met for each deliverable. For the software group or arrangements that contain only software and software-related deliverables, the revenue is allocated utilizing the residual or fair value method. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred and accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance, and the remaining portion of the software arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue. The fair value method is similar to the relative selling price method used for non-software deliverables except that the allocation of each deliverable is based on VSOE. For software groups or arrangements that contain only software and software-related deliverables in which VSOE does not exist for each deliverable (fair value method) or does not exist for each undelivered element (residual method), revenue for the entire software arrangement or group is deferred and not recognized until delivery of all elements without VSOE has occurred, unless the only undelivered element is postcontract customer support (“PCS”) in which case the entire software arrangement or group is recognized ratably over the PCS period.




	Teradata’s analytic database software and hardware products are sold and delivered together in the form of a “Node” of capacity as an integrated technology solution. Because both the analytic database software and hardware platform are necessary to deliver the analytic data platform’s essential functionality, the database software and hardware (Node) are excluded from the software rules and considered a non-software related deliverable. Teradata software applications and related support are considered software-related deliverables. Additionally, the amount of revenue allocated to the delivered items utilizing the relative selling price or fair value method is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions (the non-contingent amount).




	VSOE is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately. Teradata uses the stated renewal rate approach in establishing VSOE for maintenance and when-and-if-available upgrades (collectively referred to as PCS). Under this approach, the Company assesses whether the contractually stated renewal rates are substantive and consistent with the Company’s normal pricing practices. Renewal rates greater than the lower level of our targeted pricing ranges are considered to be substantive and, therefore, meet the requirements to support VSOE. In instances where there is not a substantive renewal rate in the arrangement, the Company allocates revenue based upon BESP, using the minimum established pricing targets as supported by the renewal rates for similar customers utilizing the bell-curve method. Teradata also offers consulting and installation-related services to its customers, which are considered non-software deliverables if they relate to the nodes. These services are rarely considered essential to the functionality of the data warehouse solution deliverable and there is never software customization of the proprietary database software. VSOE for consulting services is based on the hourly rates for standalone consulting services projects by geographic region and are indicative of the Company’s customary pricing practices. Pricing in each market is structured to obtain a reasonable margin based on input costs.




	In nearly all multiple-deliverable arrangements, the Company is unable to establish VSOE for all deliverables in the arrangement. This is due to infrequently selling each deliverable separately (such is the case with our nodes), not pricing products or services within a narrow range, or only having a limited sales history. When VSOE cannot be established, attempts are made to establish TPE of the selling price for each deliverable. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. However, Teradata’s offerings contain significant differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot typically be obtained. This is because Teradata’s products contain a significant amount of proprietary technology and its solutions offer substantially different features and functionality than other available products. As Teradata’s products are significantly different from those of its competitors, the Company is unable to establish TPE for the vast majority of its products.

	When the Company is unable to establish selling prices using VSOE or TPE, the Company uses BESP in its allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a standalone basis. The Company determines BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, geographies, market conditions, product life cycles, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, purchase volumes and pricing practices.




	The primary consideration in developing BESP for the Company’s nodes is the bell-curve method based on historical transactions. The BESP analysis is at the geography level in order to align it with the way in which the Company goes to market and establishes pricing for its products. The Company has established discount ranges off of published list prices for different geographies based on strategy and maturity of Teradata’s presence in the respective geography. There are distinctions in each geography and product group which support the use of geographies and markets for the determination of BESP. For example, the Company’s U.S. market is relatively mature and most of the large transactions are captured in this market, whereas the International markets are less mature with generally smaller deal size. Additionally, the prices and margins for the Company’s products vary by geography and by product class. BESP is analyzed on a semi-annual basis using data from the four previous quarters, which the Company believes best reflects most recent pricing practices in a changing marketplace.




	The Company reviews VSOE, TPE and its determination of BESP on a periodic basis and updates it, when appropriate, to ensure that the practices employed reflect the Company’s recent pricing experience. The Company maintains internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates, which includes review and approval by the Company’s management. For the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	 there was no material impact to revenue resulting from changes in VSOE, TPE or BESP, nor does the Company expect a material impact from such changes in the near term.









	Teradata’s new go-to-market offerings introduced in the second half of 2016, which are part of the overall business transformation strategy, include the following offerings:













	•






	Subscription license - Teradata’s subscription licenses include a right-to-use license and are typically sold with PCS. The revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized ratably over the contract term. The term of these arrangements varies between


	one


	 and


	five


	 years.
















	•






	Software as a service or Cloud - These arrangements include a right-to-access software license that the customer does not have a right to take possession of without significant penalty during the hosting period and the services can be delivered through a managed cloud, private cloud or public cloud. These arrangements are recognized outside the software rules and revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The term of these arrangements typically varies between


	one


	 and


	five


	 years.
















	•






	Rentals - Teradata owns the equipment and may or may not provide managed services. The revenue for these arrangements is generally recognized straight-line over the term of the contract. The term of these arrangements typically varies between


	one


	 and


	three


	 years and are generally accounted for as operating leases.
















	•






	Utility model - Teradata owns the equipment and may or may not provide managed services. Utility models typically include a minimum fixed amount that is recognized ratably over the contract term in addition to an elastic amount for usage above the minimum, which is recognized monthly based on actual utilization. The term of these arrangements varies between


	one


	 and


	five


	 years.







	Shipping and Handling.


	 Product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).




	Cash and Cash Equivalents.


	 All short-term, highly-liquid investments having original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.




	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.


	 Teradata establishes provisions for doubtful accounts using both percentages of accounts receivable balances to reflect historical average credit losses and specific provisions for known issues.




	Inventories.


	 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost of service parts is determined using the average cost method. Finished goods inventory is determined using actual cost.

	Table of Contents









	Available-for-sale Securities.


	Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are included in other income and expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income (loss).




	Long-Lived Assets




	Property and Equipment


	. Property and equipment, leasehold improvements and rental equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the related assets primarily on a straight-line basis. Equipment is depreciated over


	3


	 to


	20


	 years and buildings over


	25


	 to


	45


	 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. Total depreciation expense on the Company’s property and equipment for


	December 31


	 was as follows:

	Capitalized Software


	. Direct development costs associated with internal-use software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the resulting software. The costs are capitalized when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that computer software being developed will be completed and placed in service. Teradata typically amortizes capitalized internal-use software on a straight-line basis over


	three


	 years beginning when the asset is substantially ready for use.




	Costs incurred for the development of big data and analytic applications are expensed as incurred based on the frequency and agile nature of development. Prior to December 31, 2016, costs incurred for the development of analytic database software that will be sold, leased or otherwise marketed were capitalized between technological feasibility and the point at which a product is ready for general release. Technological feasibility is established when planning, designing and initial coding activities that are necessary to establish the product can be produced to meet its design specifications are complete. In the absence of a program design, a working model is used to establish technological feasibility. These costs are included within capitalized software and are amortized over the estimated useful lives of


	four


	 years using the greater of the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product beginning when the product is available for general release. Costs capitalized include direct labor and related overhead costs. Costs incurred prior to technological feasibility and after general release are expensed as incurred. The following table identifies the activity relating to capitalized software:

	Estimated expense, which is recorded to cost of sales for external use software, is based on capitalized software at


	December 31, 2016


	 and does not include any new capitalization for future periods.




	Our research and development efforts have recently become more driven by market requirements and rapidly changing customers' needs. In addition, the Company started applying agile development methodologies to help respond to new technologies and trends. Agile development methodologies are characterized by a more dynamic development process with more frequent and iterative revisions to a product release features and functions as the software is being developed. Due to the shorter development cycle and focus on rapid production associated with








	53









	Table of Contents









	agile development, the Company does not anticipate capitalizing significant amounts of external use software development costs in future periods due to the relatively short duration between the completion of the working model and the point at which a product is ready for general release. Prior capitalized costs will continue to be amortized under the greater of revenue-based or straight-line method over the estimated useful life.




	Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.


	 Long-lived assets such as property and equipment, acquired intangible assets and internal capitalized software are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying amount.




	Goodwill


	. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually or upon occurrence of an event or change in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. See Note 3- Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles for additional information.




	Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale.


	The Company classifies assets and liabilities (disposal groups) to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met:













	•






	Management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group;
















	•






	The disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups;
















	•






	An active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated;
















	•






	The sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale, within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond the Company’s control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year;
















	•






	The disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and
















	•






	Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.







	The Company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized until the date of sale. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group less costs to sell each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale.




	Upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group under Assets held for sale and Liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 15 for further information on the Company’s assets and liabilities held for sale.




	Warranty.


	 Provisions for product warranties are recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. The Company accrues warranty reserves using percentages of revenue to reflect the Company’s historical average warranty claims.




	Research and Development Costs.


	 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred (with the exception of the capitalized software development costs discussed above). Research and development costs primarily include labor-related costs, contractor fees, and overhead expenses directly related to research and development support.




	Pension and Postemployment Benefits.


	 The Company accounts for its pension and postemployment benefit obligations using actuarial models. The measurement of plan obligations was made as of


	December 31, 2016


	. Liabilities are computed using the projected unit credit method. The objective under this method is to expense each participant’s benefits under the plan as they accrue, taking into consideration salary increases and the plan’s benefit








	54









	Table of Contents









	allocation formula. Thus, the total pension or postemployment benefit to which each participant is expected to become entitled is broken down into units, each associated with a year of past or future credited service.




	The Company recognizes the funded status of its pension and postemployment plan obligations in its consolidated balance sheet and records in other comprehensive income certain gains and losses that arise during the period, but are deferred under pension accounting rules.




	Foreign Currency.


	 Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Income and expense accounts are translated at daily exchange rates prevailing during the period. Adjustments arising from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income.




	Income Taxes.


	 Income tax expense is provided based on income before income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which the Company conducts its business. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes. These deferred taxes are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Teradata recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company records valuation allowances related to its deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.




	Stock-based Compensation.


	 Stock-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, restricted shares and restricted share units, are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value. The fair value of each stock option award on the grant date is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, weighted-average risk-free interest rate and weighted average expected term of the options. The Company’s expected volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is based on Teradata's historical volatility. The expected term for options granted is based upon historical observation of actual time elapsed between date of grant and exercise of options for all employees. Prior to 2015, the expected term assumption was based on the simplified method under GAAP, which is based on the vesting period and contractual term for each vesting tranche of awards. The mid-point between the vesting date and the expiration date was used as the expected term under this method. The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model is based on the implied yield curve available on U.S. Treasury issues at the date of grant with a remaining term equal to the Company’s expected term assumption. The Company has never declared or paid a cash dividend.




	Treasury Stock.


	 Prior to the


	fourth


	 quarter of


	2015


	 when all treasury stock shares were retired, shares of the Company’s common stock repurchased through the share repurchase programs were held as treasury stock. Treasury stock was accounted for using the cost method. Beginning in the


	fourth


	 quarter of


	2015


	, stock repurchased through the share repurchase programs will be retired upon repurchase. The excess repurchase price over the par value is charged to retained earnings.




	Earnings (Loss) Per Share.


	 Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reported period. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the weighted-average number of shares outstanding includes the dilution from potential shares added from stock options, restricted share awards and other stock awards. Refer to Note 5 for share information on the Company’s stock compensation plans.




	The components of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are as follows:

	, due to the net loss attributable to Teradata common stockholders, largely due to the goodwill and acquired intangibles impairment charges, potential common shares that would cause dilution, such as employee stock options, restricted shares and other stock awards, have been excluded from the diluted share count because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements




	Revenue Recognition.




	 I


	n May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance that affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The new guidance will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in the current revenue recognition guidance, and most industry-specific guidance. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement in this update. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, the FASB defines a five step process which includes the following: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB issued a one-year delay in the effective date of the new standard. Under this guidance, the new revenue standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early application permitted. The standard allows entities to apply the standard retrospectively for all periods presented or alternatively an entity is permitted to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance as an opening balance sheet adjustment to retained earnings in the period of initial application.




	In March 2016, the FASB issued an update that amends and clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations for reporting revenue gross rather than net. In April 2016, the FASB issued an update that amends and clarifies the identification of performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.




	In May 2016, the FASB issued an update which addresses the narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectibility, non-cash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. Additionally, the amendments in this update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. All updates issued in 2016 have the same deferred effective date. The Company plans to adopt the new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the method of transition that will be used in adopting the standard.

	Table of Contents









	Although the Company is still evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements, including evaluating the different adoption methodologies, the Company believes the most significant impacts may include the following items:













	•






	As the Company transitions to the new go-to-market offerings, such as subscription licenses, the Company could potentially see a more significant impact in the amount of revenue recognized over time under the current rules but upfront under the new rules
















	•






	The Company currently expenses contract acquisition costs and believes that the requirement to defer incremental contract acquisition costs and recognize them over the term of the contract to which the costs relate could have an impact, especially as the Company transitions to longer-term, over-time revenue contracts
















	•






	The amount of revenue allocated to the delivered items and recognized upfront utilizing the relative selling price model is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions (i.e. the non-contingent amount) under current rules. Under the new rules, the amounts allocated to delivered items and recognized upfront could be higher if it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur in future periods upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions.












	The Company does not expect that the new standard will result in substantive changes in our deliverables or the amounts of revenue allocated between multiple deliverables, with the exception of contingent revenue discussed above. The Company is still in the process of evaluating these impacts, and our initial assessment may change as the Company continues with implementing new systems, processes, accounting policies and internal controls.




	Leases.


	  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires a lessee to account for leases as finance or operating leases. Both leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet, with differing methodology for income statement recognition. For lessors, the standard modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. Entities will classify leases to determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense. This standard is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective approach is required for leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements.









	Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments


	. In August 2016, the FASB issued an update addressing eight specific cash flow issues in an effort to reduce diversity in practice. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and for interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its consolidated statements of cash flows.




	Financial Instruments.


	 In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which enhances the reporting model for financial instruments and related disclosures. This update


	requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net income and will eliminate the cost method for equity securities without readily determinable fair values.


	 The provisions are effective for public entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, in certain circumstances. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.









	Intra-entity asset transfers.


	  In October 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance to simplify the accounting for income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. Under this guidance, companies will be required to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer when the transfer occurs. Current guidance prohibits companies from recognizing current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the period of adoption. The guidance is








	57









	Table of Contents









	effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements.









	Classification of restricted cash


	. In December 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance to address diversity in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. Under this guidance, companies will be required to present restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its statement of cash flows.




	Clarification on the definition of a business


	. In January 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.




	Simplifying the measurement for goodwill


	. In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for the impairment of goodwill. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The guidance is required to be applied prospectively and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to early adopt this accounting guidance effective January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect any impact from the adoption of the new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements.




	Recently Adopted Guidance









	Accounting for Share-based Payments with Performance Targets.


	  In June 2014, the FASB issued new guidance that requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016. This amendment did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.









	Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  


	To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016 on a retrospective basis. Debt issuance costs of


	$3 million


	 at December 2015 and


	$2 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 have been presented as a deduction from the carrying value of the related long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.




	Intangibles, Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software.


	 The amendments in this update provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance will not change current guidance for a customer’s accounting for service contracts. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016. This amendment did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

	Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.


	  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the Statements of Cash Flows. The Company elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended December 31, 2016 retroactively to January 1, 2016. The impact of early adoption resulted in the following:













	•






	The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (shortfalls) from vested or settled share-based awards to be recorded in the provision for income taxes on the income statement rather than in paid-in capital. This change was applied on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2016, which resulted in additional tax expense of


	$5 million


	 for the year ended December 31, 2016.
















	•






	The tax withholding threshold for triggering liability accounting on a net settlement transaction has been increased from the minimum statutory rate to the maximum. This change was applied on a modified retrospective basis as of January 1, 2016, which resulted in no impact to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016 where the cumulative effect of this change is required to be recorded.
















	•






	The Company elected to change its accounting policy for forfeitures to record them as they occur. The change was applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of less than


	$1 million


	 as of January 1, 2016.
















	•






	The Company no longer reflects the cash received from the excess tax benefits within cash flows from financing activities but instead now reflects this benefit within cash flows from operating activities. This change in presentation was applied prospectively as of January 1, 2016, which resulted in an increase in net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used by financing activities of


	$3 million


	 for the year ended December 31, 2016.
















	•






	The presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows since these cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity.
















	•






	The Company excluded excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of our diluted earnings per share. This change was applied on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2016, which decreased diluted weighted average common shares outstanding by approximately


	131


	 thousand shares in 2016.

	In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company committed to a plan to exit the marketing applications business, which met the criteria for held for sale and continued to be reported under continuing operations. The business was subsequently sold on July 1, 2016. Not included in the table above is


	$113 million


	 at December 31, 2015 for goodwill that had been classified as held for sale. See Note 15 for additional disclosures related to the sale of the business and impairment charges recorded for goodwill that had been classified as held for sale. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded additional goodwill of


	$11 million


	, for an immaterial acquisition that occurred during the period.









	In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and determined that no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill was necessary. The Company reviewed two reporting units in its 2016 goodwill impairment assessment, as both geographic operating segments were considered separate reporting units for purposes of testing. Based on the Company's evaluation and weighting of the events and circumstances that have occurred since the most recent Step 1 test, the Company concluded that it was not more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value was below its carrying value. Therefore, the Company determined that it was not necessary to perform a Step 1 goodwill impairment test for the reporting units in 2016.

	The

	 effective tax rate was impacted by the


	$57 million


	 of goodwill impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of 2016, all of which was treated as a permanent, non-deductible tax item. In addition, a discrete tax charge of


	$22 million


	 was recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to the tax impact of the sale of the marketing applications business, which occurred on July 1, 2016. In the fourth quarter of


	2016


	, the Company recorded


	$8 million


	 of tax expense associated with the issuance of new U.S. Treasury Regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 987 on December 7, 2016, which clarified how companies calculate foreign currency translation gains and losses for income tax purposes for branches whose accounting records are kept in a currency other than the currency of the company. Also in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company elected to early adopt Accounting Standards

	Update 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting. As a result, the Company incurred a


	$5 million


	 discrete tax expense associated with the net shortfall arising from 2016 equity compensation vestings and exercises.




	The 2015 effective tax rate was impacted by the


	$437 million


	 of goodwill impairment charges recorded for 2015, of which $


	414 million


	 was treated as a permanent non-deductible tax item. This resulted in full-year income tax expense in 2015 of


	$70 million


	, on a pre-tax net loss of


	$(144) million


	, causing a negative tax rate of


	(48.6)%


	. There were no material discrete tax items impacting the effective tax rate for full year

	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, Teradata has net operating loss ("NOL") and tax credit carryforwards totaling


	$56 million


	 (tax effected and before any valuation allowance offset and application of recognition criteria for uncertain tax positions). Of the total tax carryforwards,


	$13 million


	 are NOL's in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, a small portion of which will begin to expire in


	2019


	;


	$2 million


	 are U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, which expire in 2021;


	$37 million


	 are California R&D tax credits that have an indefinite carryforward period (which has a


	$26 million


	 valuation allowance offset recorded); and the remaining


	$4 million


	 are tax attributes that were acquired from various acquisitions and were not recorded for financial reporting purposes as they did not meet the recognition criteria for uncertain tax positions.




	The Company’s intention is to permanently reinvest its foreign earnings outside of the U.S. As a result, the effective tax rates in the periods presented are largely based upon the pre-tax earnings mix and allocation of certain expenses in various taxing jurisdictions where the Company conducts its business; these jurisdictions apply a broad range of statutory income tax rates. At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had not provided for federal income taxes on earnings of approximately


	$1.3 billion


	 from its foreign subsidiaries. Should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes and potential withholding taxes in various international jurisdictions. The U.S. taxes would be partially offset by U.S. foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not practical because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation.




	The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company reflects any interest and penalties recorded in connection with its uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company’s uncertain tax positions totaled approximately


	$30 million


	, of which


	$20 million


	 is reflected in the other liabilities section of the Company’s balance sheet as a non-current liability. The remaining balance of


	$10 million


	 of uncertain tax positions relates to certain tax attributes both generated by the Company and acquired in various acquisitions, which are netted against the underlying deferred tax assets recorded








	63









	Table of Contents









	on the balance sheet. The entire balance of


	$30 million


	 in uncertain tax positions would cause a decrease in the effective income tax rate upon recognition. Teradata has recorded


	$2 million


	 of interest accruals related to its uncertain tax liabilities as of


	December 31, 2016


	.

	December 31, 2016


	, the Company has ongoing tax audits in a limited number of state and foreign jurisdictions. However, no material adjustments have been proposed or made in any of these examinations to date which would result in any incremental income tax expense in future periods to the Company. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service audit of the Company’s U.S. Federal tax filing for tax year

	The Teradata Corporation 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2007 SIP”), as amended, and the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2012 SIP”) provide for the grant of several different forms of stock-based compensation. The 2012 SIP was adopted and approved by stockholders in April 2012 and no further awards may be made under the 2007 SIP after that time. A total of approximately


	17.5 million


	 shares were authorized to be issued under the 2012 SIP. New shares of the Company’s common stock are issued as a result of the vesting of restricted share units and stock option exercises, and at the time of grant for restricted shares, for awards under both plans.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company’s primary types of stock-based compensation were stock options, restricted shares, restricted share units and the employee stock purchase program (the “ESPP”).




	Stock Options




	The Compensation and Human Resource Committee of Teradata’s Board of Directors has discretion to determine the material terms and conditions of option awards under both the 2007 SIP and the 2012 SIP (collectively, the “Teradata SIP”), provided that (i) the exercise price must be no less than the fair market value of Teradata common stock (as defined in both plans) on the date of grant, and (ii) the term must be no longer than


	ten years


	. Option grants generally have a


	four


	-year vesting period.




	The weighted-average fair value of options granted for Teradata equity awards was


	$10.68


	 in 2016,


	$11.37


	 in


	2015


	 and


	17.67

	As of

	, there was

	 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option grants. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of


	3.2


	 years.




	Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units




	The Teradata SIP provides for the issuance of restricted shares, as well as restricted share units. These grants consist of both service-based and performance-based awards. Service-based awards typically vest over a


	three


	 year period beginning on the effective date of grant. These grants are not subject to future performance measures. The cost of these awards, determined to be the fair market value at the date of grant, is expensed ratably over the vesting period. For substantially all restricted share grants, at the date of grant, the recipient has all rights of a stockholder, subject to certain restrictions on transferability and a risk of forfeiture. A recipient of restricted share units does not have the rights of a stockholder and is subject to restrictions on transferability and risk of forfeiture. For both restricted share grants and restricted share units, any potential dividend rights would be subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity award. As a result, such rights are considered a contingent transfer of value and consequently these equity awards are not considered participating securities. Performance-based grants are subject to future performance measurements over a


	one


	-to


	four


	-year period. All performance-based shares that are earned in respect of an award will become vested at the end of the performance and/or service period provided the employee is continuously employed by the Company and applicable performance measures and other vesting conditions are met. The fair value of each performance-based award is determined on the grant date, based on the Company’s stock price, and assumes that performance targets will be achieved. Over the performance period, the number of shares of stock that will be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon management’s assessment of the probability of achievement of performance targets. The ultimate number of shares issued and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of the final achievement of performance metrics to the specified targets.

	In 2012, approximately


	0.3 million


	 shares of the performance awards issued included challenging or “stretch” financial goals through 2016 based on a GAAP revenue and/or non-GAAP earnings per share targets in 2016. Each recipient’s opportunity to earn the award is based on performance over a


	four


	-year period ending in 2016. There was


	no


	 compensation expense related to these awards recorded in


	2016


	 as the performance targets for these awards were not achieved.




	Performance-based share units granted as part of our long-term incentive program for certain corporate officers and key executives will be earned based on Teradata's total shareholder return ("TSR") over a


	three


	-year performance period relative to the other companies in the S&P 1500 Technology Index. The number of shares actually issued, as a percentage of the amount subject to the performance share award, could range from


	0%


	 to


	200%


	. The grant date fair value of the non-vested performance-based awards was determined through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model, which utilized multiple input variables that determined the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements applicable to each award. The compensation expense for the award will be recognized as long as the requisite service is rendered, regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved.




	Modifications


	In connection with the plan to exit most of the marketing applications business and the departure of certain executives, the Company modified its awards for certain employees to accelerate the vesting of any unvested awards at the date of sale. This modification resulted in a Type III modification (improbable to probable). In addition, a modification to extend the exercise period of all vested options from

	Employee Stock Purchase Program




	The Company’s ESPP, effective on


	October 1, 2007


	, and as amended effective as of


	January 1, 2013


	, provides eligible employees of Teradata and its designated subsidiaries an opportunity to purchase the Company’s common stock at a discount to the average of the highest and lowest sale prices on the last trading day of each month. The ESPP discount was


	15%


	 of the average market price and is considered compensatory.




	Employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to


	10%


	 of eligible compensation for common stock purchases. A total of


	4 million


	 shares were authorized to be issued under the ESPP, with approximately


	1.0 million


	 shares remaining under that authorization at


	December 31, 2016


	. The shares of Teradata common stock purchased by a participant on an exercise date (the last day of each month), for all purposes, are deemed to have been issued and sold at the close of business on such exercise date. Prior to that time, none of the rights or privileges of a stockholder exists with respect to such shares. Employee purchases and aggregate cost were as follows at

	Note 6 Employee Benefit Plans




	Pension and Postemployment Plans.


	 Teradata currently sponsors defined benefit pension plans for certain of its international employees. For those international pension plans for which the Company holds asset balances, those assets are primarily invested in common/collective trust funds (which include publicly traded common stocks, corporate and government debt securities, real estate indirect investments, cash or cash equivalents) and insurance contracts.




	Postemployment obligations relate to benefits provided to involuntarily terminated employees and certain inactive employees after employment but before retirement. These benefits are paid in accordance with various foreign statutory laws and regulations, and Teradata’s established postemployment benefit practices and policies. Postemployment benefits may include disability benefits, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance, workers’ compensation benefits, continuation of health care benefits and life insurance coverage, and are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.




	In 2016 the Company eliminated the accumulation of postemployment benefits based on service for the U.S. separation plan. As a result of this change, postemployment benefits for the U.S. will no longer be accounted for using actuarial models.




	Pension and postemployment benefit costs for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

	The Company determines the expected return on assets based on individual plan asset allocations, historical capital market returns, and long-term interest rate assumptions, with input from its actuaries, investment managers, and independent investment advisors. The company emphasizes long-term expectations in its evaluation of return factors, discounting or ignoring short-term market fluctuations. Expected asset returns are reviewed annually, but are generally modified only when asset allocation strategies change or long-term economic trends are identified.




	The discount rate used to determine year-end


	2016


	 U.S. benefit obligations was derived by matching the plans’ expected future cash flows to the corresponding yields from the Citigroup Pension Liability Index. This yield curve has been constructed to represent the available yields on high-quality fixed-income investments across a broad range of future maturities. International discount rates were determined by examining interest rate levels and trends within each country, particularly yields on high-quality long-term corporate bonds, relative to our future expected cash flows.




	Gains and losses have resulted from changes in actuarial assumptions and from differences between assumed and actual experience, including, among other items, changes in discount rates and differences between actual and assumed asset returns. These gains and losses (except those differences being amortized to the market-related value) are only amortized to the extent that they exceed


	10%


	 of the higher of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation of each respective plan.

	Fair Value.


	 Fair value measurements are established utilizing a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers are more fully described in Note 9.




	The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension assets as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Common/collective trust funds (which include money market funds, equity funds, bond funds, real-estate indirect investments, etc.)


	: Valued at the net asset value (“NAV”) of shares held by the Plan at year end, as reported to the Plan by the trustee, which represents the fair value of shares held by the Plan. Because the NAV of the shares held in the common/collective trust funds are derived by the value of the underlying investments, the Company has classified these underlying investments as Level 2 fair value measurements.




	Insurance contracts:


	 Valued by discounting the related future benefit payments using a current year-end market discount rate, which represents the fair value of the insurance contract. The Company has classified these contracts as Level 3 assets for fair value measurement purposes.




	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the pension plan assets at fair value as of


	December 31, 2016

	Investment Strategy.


	 Teradata employs a number of investment strategies across its various international pension plans. In some countries, particularly where Teradata does not have a large employee base, the Company may use insurance (annuity) contracts to satisfy its future pension payment obligations, whereby the Company makes pension plan contributions to an insurance company in exchange for which the pension plan benefits will be paid when the members reach a specified retirement age or on earlier exit of members from the plan. In other countries, the Company may employ local asset managers to manage investment portfolios according to the investment policies and guidelines established by the Company, and with consideration to individual plan liability structure and local market environment and risk tolerances. The Company’s investment policies and guidelines primarily emphasize diversification across and within asset classes to maximize long-term returns subject to prudent levels of risk, with the overall objective of enabling the plans to meet their future obligations. The investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across domestic and international stocks, small and large capitalization stocks, and growth and value stocks. Fixed-income assets are diversified across government and corporate bonds. Where applicable, real estate investments are made through real estate securities, partnership interests or direct investment, and are diversified by property type and location.

	Savings Plans.


	 U.S. employees and many international employees participate in defined contribution savings plans. These plans generally provide either a specified percent of pay or a matching contribution on participating employees’ voluntary elections. The Company’s matching contributions typically are subject to a maximum percentage or level of compensation. Employee contributions can be made pre-tax, after-tax or a combination thereof.

	Note 7 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities




	As a portion of the Company’s operations and revenue occur outside the U.S. and in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is exposed to potential gains and losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In an attempt to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations, the Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge transactional exposures resulting predominantly from foreign currency denominated inter-company receivables and payables. The forward contracts are designated as fair value hedges of specified foreign currency denominated inter-company receivables and payables and generally mature in three months or less. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does it hold or issue leveraged derivative instruments. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates, the Company exposes itself to credit risk. The Company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of the applicable contracts.




	All derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. The fair values of foreign exchange contracts are based on market spot and forward exchange rates and represent estimates of possible value that may not be realized in the future. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability, are recorded in current period earnings. The notional amounts represent agreed-upon amounts on which calculations of dollars to be exchanged are based, and are an indication of the extent of Teradata’s involvement in such instruments. These notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a measure of the instruments. Across its portfolio of contracts, Teradata has both long and short positions relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, Teradata’s net involvement is less than the total contract notional amount of the Company’s foreign exchange forward contracts.

	. Gains and losses from foreign exchange forward contracts are fully recognized each period and reported along with the offsetting gain or loss of the related hedged item, either in cost of products or in other income, depending on the nature of the related hedged item.








	Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies




	In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, governmental investigations, claims and other matters, including those that relate to the environment, health and safety, employee benefits, export compliance, intellectual property, tax matters, and other regulatory compliance and general matters.




	Guarantees and Product Warranties.




	Guarantees associated with the Company’s business activities are reviewed for appropriateness and impact to the Company’s financial statements. Periodically, the Company’s customers enter into various leasing arrangements coordinated with a leasing company. In some instances, the Company guarantees the leasing company a minimum value at the end of the lease term on the leased equipment. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the maximum future payment obligation of this guaranteed value and the associated liability balance was


	$4 million


	.




	The Company provides its customers a standard manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. Estimated future obligations due to warranty claims are based upon historical factors such as labor rates, average repair time, travel time, number of service calls and cost of replacement parts. For each consummated sale, the Company recognizes the total customer revenue and records the associated warranty liability using pre-established warranty percentages for that product class.

	The Company also offers extended and/or enhanced coverage to its customers in the form of maintenance contracts. The Company accounts for these contracts by deferring the related maintenance revenue over the extended and/or enhanced coverage period. Costs associated with maintenance support are expensed as incurred. Amounts associated with these maintenance contracts are not included in the table above.




	In addition, the Company provides its customers with certain indemnification rights. In general, the Company agrees to indemnify the customer if a third party asserts patent or other infringement on the part of the customer for its use of the Company’s products. The Company has indemnification obligations under its charter and bylaws to its officers and directors, and has entered into indemnification agreements with the officers and directors of its subsidiaries. From time to time, the Company also enters into agreements in connection with its acquisition and divesture activities that include indemnification obligations by the Company, including the sale of the marketing applications business. The fair value of these indemnification obligations is typically not readily determinable due to the conditional nature of the Company’s potential obligations and the specific facts and circumstances involved with each particular agreement. As such, the Company has generally not recorded a liability in connection with these








	73









	Table of Contents









	indemnification arrangements. Historically, payments made by the Company under these types of agreements have not had a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.




	Leases.


	 Teradata conducts certain of its sales and administrative operations using leased facilities, the initial lease terms of which vary in length. Many of the leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses that are not material to the overall lease portfolio.

	Concentrations of Risk.


	 The Company is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments such as hedging instruments, and cash and cash equivalents. Credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties. The maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet. Exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals, credit limits, selecting major international financial institutions (as counterparties to hedging transactions) and monitoring procedures. Teradata’s business often involves large transactions with customers, and if one or more of those customers were to default in its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements, the Company could be exposed to potentially significant losses. However, management believes that the reserves for potential losses were adequate at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	.




	The Company is also potentially subject to concentrations of supplier risk. Our hardware components are assembled exclusively by Flextronics International Ltd. (“Flextronics”). Flextronics procures a wide variety of components used in the manufacturing process on our behalf. Although many of these components are available from multiple sources, Teradata utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure more consistent quality, cost and delivery. Typically, these preferred suppliers maintain alternative processes and/or facilities to ensure continuity of supply. Given the Company’s strategy to outsource its manufacturing activities to Flextronics and to source certain components from single suppliers, a disruption in production at Flextronics or at a supplier could impact the timing of customer shipments and/or Teradata’s operating results.








	Note 9 Fair Value Measurements




	Fair value measurements are established utilizing a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, defined as significant other observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or quoted prices in less-active markets for identical assets; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.




	The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include money market funds and foreign currency exchange contracts. A portion of the Company’s excess cash reserves are held in money market funds which generate interest income based on the prevailing market rates. Money market funds are included in








	74









	Table of Contents









	cash and cash equivalents in the Company’s balance sheet. Money market fund holdings are measured at fair value using quoted market prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.




	When deemed appropriate, the Company minimizes its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of derivative financial instruments, specifically, forward foreign exchange contracts. The fair value of these contracts are measured at the end of each interim reporting period using observable inputs other than quoted prices, specifically market spot and forward exchange rates. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Fair value gains for open contracts are recognized as assets and fair value losses are recognized as liabilities. The fair value derivative assets and liabilities recorded in other current assets and accrued liabilities at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, were not material. Any realized gains or losses would be mitigated by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying exposures. Further information on the Company’s use of forward foreign exchange contracts is included in Note 7.




	The Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and subject to fair value disclosure requirements at


	December 31,


	 were as follows:

	Teradata's 


	$600 million


	 term loan is payable in quarterly installments, which commenced on March 31, 2016, with all remaining principal due in March 2020. The outstanding principal amount under the term loan agreement bears interest at a floating rate based upon a negotiated base rate or a Eurodollar rate plus a margin based on the leverage ratio of the Company. As of 


	December 31, 2016


	, the term loan principal outstanding was 


	$570 million


	 and carried an interest rate of 


	2.1875%


	. Unamortized deferred issuance costs of approximately 


	$2 million


	 are being amortized over the 


	five


	-year term of the loan. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2016.




	Annual contractual maturities of principal on term loan outstanding at

	Teradata’s term loan is recognized on the Company’s balance sheet at its unpaid principal balance, and is not subject to fair value measurement. However, given that the loan carries a variable rate, the Company estimates that the unpaid principal balance of the term loan would approximate its fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, the Company’s term loan would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.




	Teradata's revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) has a borrowing capacity of $


	400 million


	. The Credit Facility ends on March 25, 2020 at which point any remaining outstanding borrowings would be due for repayment unless extended by agreement of the parties for up to 


	two


	 additional


	one


	-year periods. The interest rate charged on borrowings pursuant to the Credit Facility can vary depending on the interest rate option the Company chooses to utilize and the Company’s leverage ratio at the time of the borrowing. In the near term, Teradata would anticipate choosing a floating rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). The Credit Facility is unsecured and contains certain representations and warranties, conditions, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for such facilities. As of 


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had 


	no

	Note 11 Segment, Other Supplemental Information and Concentrations




	Effective


	January 1, 2016


	, Teradata implemented an organizational change in which it decided to manage the Company's business under


	two




	g


	eographic regions and the marketing applications division (prior to its completed sale on July 1, 2016); which are also the Company’s operating segments: (1) Americas Data and Analytics (North America and Latin America); (2) International Data and Analytics (Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Japan); and (3) Marketing Applications. Effective July 1, 2016, following the sale of the marketing applications business, Teradata is managing its business in 


	two


	 operating segments: (1) Americas region (North America and Latin America); and (2) International region (Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Japan). For purposes of discussing results by segment, management excludes the impact of certain items, consistent with the manner by which management evaluates the performance of each segment. This format is useful to investors because it allows analysis and comparability of operating trends. It also includes the same information that is used by Teradata management to make decisions regarding the segments and to assess financial performance. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of the segments based on revenue and multiple profit measures, including segment gross margin. For management reporting purposes assets are not allocated to the segments. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

	Concentrations.




	No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Company's revenue


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company is not aware of any significant concentration of business transacted with a particular customer that could, if suddenly eliminated, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations. The Company's hardware components are assembled exclusively by Flextronics. In addition, the Company utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure more consistent quality, cost and delivery. There can be no assurances that a disruption in production at Flextronics or at a supplier would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations.








	 Note 12 Business Combinations and Other Investment Activities




	During


	2016


	, the Company completed


	one


	 immaterial business acquisition, which complements and strengthens the Company's global portfolio, and released hold-back amounts from several prior-year acquisitions for


	$16 million


	. The Company also sold the marketing applications business on July 1, 2016 (see Note 15).




	During


	2015


	, the Company completed


	two


	 immaterial business acquisitions for


	$17 million


	, which complemented and strengthened the Company's global portfolio. One of the acquisitions pertained to the marketing applications business, which the Company exited on July 1, 2016 and therefore was classified in the assets held for sale (see Note 15) as of December 31, 2015. In addition, the Company sold


	two


	 equity investments for


	$85 million


	 and recognized a gain of


	$57 million


	.




	During 2014, the Company completed


	six


	 immaterial business acquisitions and other equity investments for


	$69 million


	. These acquisitions complemented and strengthened the Company's global portfolio.


	Two


	 of these acquisitions pertained to the marketing applications business. In addition, the Company recognized a loss of


	$9 million


	 in an equity investment arising from an impairment of carrying value.

	Note 14 Reorganization and Business Transformation




	In the


	fourth


	 quarter of


	2015


	 the Company announced a plan to realign Teradata’s business by reducing its cost structure and focusing on the Company’s core data and analytics business. This business transformation includes exiting the marketing applications business (see Note 15), rationalizing costs, and modifying the Company’s go-to-market approach. The Company incurred the following costs related to these actions for the years ended December 31:

	Total reorganization and business transformation cost






	 






	$






	129













	 






	$






	152

















	The charges for asset write-downs were for non-cash write-downs of goodwill, acquired intangibles and other assets (see Note 15). In addition to the costs and charges incurred above, the Company made cash payments of


	$20 million


	 in 2016 and


	$14 million


	 in 2015 for employee severance that did not have a material impact on its Statement of Operations due to Teradata accounting for its postemployment benefits under


	Accounting Standards Codification 712


	,


	Compensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits


	 (“ASC 712”), which uses actuarial estimates and defers the immediate recognition of gains or losses. Because the Company accounts for postemployment benefits under


	ASC 712


	, it did not record any liability associated with


	ASC 420


	,


	Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations


	.  








	Note 15 Impairment and Sale of the Marketing Applications Business




	The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually in the


	fourth


	 quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company determined that indicators were present in the marketing applications business which would suggest the fair value may have declined below the carrying value. The indicators were primarily lower than forecasted revenue and profitability levels for 2015 and future periods. Based on our analysis, the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of


	$340 million


	 during the second quarter of 2015.









	In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company committed to a plan to exit the marketing applications business. The assets and liabilities for this business, which were included within our marketing applications segment, were classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2015 and, therefore, the corresponding depreciation and amortization expense ceased at that time. The divestiture was not presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements because it did not have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. The Company then performed a goodwill impairment analysis of the business to be disposed of. As a result of this analysis, the Company recognized an additional goodwill impairment of


	$97 million


	 in the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, acquired intangible assets were reduced by


	$41 million


	 to adjust the carrying amount of the disposal group's net assets and liabilities down to its fair value less cost to sell.

	Table of Contents














	On April 22, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with TMA Solutions, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership and affiliate of Marlin Equity Partners (“Marlin Equity”), to sell the marketing applications business for 


	$90 million


	 in cash, subject to a post-closing adjustment for working capital, debt and other metrics. We recognized an impairment of goodwill of $


	57 million


	 and acquired intangibles of 


	$19 million


	 in the first quarter of 2016 to adjust the carrying value of the net assets of our marketing applications business to fair value less cost to sell.









	P


	rior to the sale that occurred on July 1, 2016, the marketing applications business that was classified as held for sale generated revenue of


	$69 million


	 and an operating loss of


	$112 million


	 (which includes loss from impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles of


	$76 million


	) for the six months ended June 30, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company generated revenue of


	$153 million


	 and an operating loss of


	$561 million


	 (which includes loss from impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles of


	$478 million

	n July 1, 2016, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Teradata completed the sale of Teradata’s marketing applications business to Marlin Equity. The purchase price received for this business was approximately 


	$92


	 million in cash, subject to a post-closing adjustment for working capital, debt and other metrics. Transaction costs and post-closing obligations were approximately


	$5 million


	. Upon completion of the divestiture of the held for sale assets in July 2016, no material gain or loss was recognized as the carrying value of the held for sale assets was equal to the purchase price received less costs to sell.









	The Company recorded tax expense of approximately 


	$22 million


	 in the third quarter of 2016 related to this transaction. The total tax expense, of which 


	$14 million


	 is cash taxes due to having zero tax basis in goodwill, was calculated based on the amount of proceeds allocated to the various jurisdictions in accordance with the Purchase Agreement at the local statutory rates. The tax expense reported in the third quarter of 2016 is subject to change pending finalization of the working capital, transaction costs and other adjustments.









	In connection with the closing of the transaction, the parties entered into a transition services agreement, pursuant to which Teradata will provide certain services to Marlin Equity, including accounting, human resources, order processing and invoicing and information technology services for a service period of up to 15 months after the closing of the transaction.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES









	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	Teradata maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information








	81









	Table of Contents









	is accumulated and communicated to management, including, as appropriate, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.




	Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance as of December 31, 2016.




	Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Teradata’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	Management assessed the effectiveness of Teradata’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in


	Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)


	. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management concluded that Teradata’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.




	Teradata’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued their report on the effectiveness of Teradata’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, which appears in this Annual Report.




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan




	(as Amended and Restated January 30, 2017 to be Effective as of February 1, 2017)









	Introduction




	The Board of Directors of Teradata Corporation (the “


	Board


	”) recognizes that, from time to time, the Company may explore potential transactions that could result in a Change in Control of the Company. This possibility and the uncertainty it creates may result in the loss or distraction of certain key Employees of the Company to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.




	The Board considers the avoidance of such loss and distraction to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board also believes that when a Change in Control is perceived as imminent, or is occurring, the Board should be able to receive and rely on disinterested service from Employees regarding the best interests of the Company and its stockholders without concern that Employees might be distracted or concerned by the personal uncertainties and risks created by the perception of an imminent or occurring Change in Control.




	In addition, the Board believes that it is consistent with the Company’s employment practices and policies and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to treat fairly its Employees whose employment terminates in connection with or following a Change in Control.




	Accordingly, the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to assure the Company of the continued employment and attention and dedication to duty of its Employees and to seek to ensure the availability of their continued service, notwithstanding the possibility or occurrence of a Change in Control.




	Therefore, in order to fulfill the above purposes, the Board has caused the Company to adopt this Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan (the “


	Plan


	”).




	The Plan is intended to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“


	ERISA


	”), and other applicable laws.




	To the extent the separation pay portion of the Plan is a pension plan, it qualifies for exemption from Parts II, III and IV of ERISA as a plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated Employees under Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.




	ARTICLE I





	ESTABLISHMENT OF PLAN




	As of the Effective Date, the Company established the Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan, and the Plan was previously amended and restated on October 7, 2008 and on July 24, 2012 (to be effective as of January 1, 2013). On January 30, 2017 (the “


	Restatement Date


	”), the Plan was amended and restated in its entirety, as set forth in this document to be effective as of February 1, 2017.

	Exhibit 10.5

	DEFINITIONS




	As used herein, the following words and phrases shall have the following respective meanings:

	”. An amount equal to the Participant’s average bonus earned under the Bonus Plan for the last three full fiscal years prior to the Date of Termination (or for such lesser number of full fiscal years prior to the Date of Termination for which the Participant was eligible to earn such a bonus, and annualized in the case of any pro rata bonus earned for a partial fiscal year),


	provided


	 that in the event that the Participant was not eligible to receive an annual bonus during any of the preceding three full fiscal years, an amount equal to the Participant’s Target Bonus.




	(d)    “


	Bonus Plan


	”. The Company’s Management Incentive Plan or such other annual incentive bonus plan of the Company applicable to the Participant for any particular fiscal year.




	(e)     “

	”. The Board of Directors of Teradata Corporation.




	(f)     “


	Cause


	”.

For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Participant, shall be considered “willful” unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Participant in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Participant’s action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer (except if the Participant is the Chief Executive Officer) or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Participant in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The termination of employment of the Participant shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Participant a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Participant and the Participant is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board),

	7












	Exhibit 10.5








	Employee as a Participant.

	ARTICLE IV





	SEPARATION BENEFITS




	4.1     


	Right to Separation Benefit


	. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.4 and subject to the restrictions of Section 4.6, a Participant shall be entitled to receive from the Company a Separation Benefit in the amount provided in Section 4.2 if, within the two year period following the Change in Control, (i) a Participant’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (other than by reason of the Participant’s death or Disability) or (ii) a Participant’s employment is terminated by the Participant for Good Reason;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any benefits be provided to a Participant under this Plan unless the Participant has executed a restrictive covenant and release agreement in the form attached hereto as


	Exhibit A


	 (the “Release”), the Participant has not revoked the Release, and the Release has become effective and irrevocable in accordance with its terms by the Payment Date.

	provided, however


	, that such amount shall be paid hereunder only to the extent that the Participant is not otherwise entitled to receive a partial payment for the year of termination under the terms of the applicable Bonus Plan for the period prior to the Date of Termination).




	(c)     


	Welfare and Other Benefits


	.

	provided, however


	, that notwithstanding the Welfare Benefit Period, such medical and other welfare benefits shall terminate upon such time as the Participant becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive such benefits under another employer provided plan.

	Exhibit 10.5








	COBRA continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code (“


	COBRA Coverage


	”) shall not be offset by the provision of benefits under this Section and the period of COBRA Coverage shall commence at the end of the Welfare Benefit Period, during which the Participant receives benefits under this Section).




	(ii)    A Participant entitled to a Separation Benefit will also be entitled to participate in the Company’s outplacement assistance program, provided by the Company’s selected outplacement services firm, as in effect under the Company’s policy applicable to the Participant on the date of the Change in Control, for a period of one (1) year following his or her Date of Termination.




	(iii)    In addition, to the extent a Participant entitled to a Separation Benefit was eligible to receive financial counseling benefits under the Company’s policy in effect at the time of a Change in Control, such Participant shall be entitled to receive such financial counseling benefits for a period of one (1) year following his or her Date of Termination.




	(iv)    The continued benefits described in this Section that are taxable benefits (and that are not disability pay or death benefit plans within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) are intended to comply, to the maximum extent possible, with the exception to Section 409A of the Code set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) of the Treasury Regulations.

	4.3     


	Other Benefits Payable

	Exhibit 10.5








	payable or exercisable upon the occurrence of a Change in Control to the extent provided in the applicable plan.




	4.4     


	Reduction in Certain Payments


	.




	(a)    In the event that it shall be determined by the Accounting Firm that any Payment to a Participant would be subject to the Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine whether to reduce the aggregate amount of the Payments payable to such Participant to the Reduced Amount. The Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount only if the Accounting Firm determines that the Participant would have a greater Net After-Tax Benefit if the Participant's Payments were reduced to the Reduced Amount. If instead the Accounting Firm determines that the Participant would have a greater Net After-Tax Benefit if the Participant's Payments were not reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Participant shall receive all Payments to which the Participant is entitled.




	(b)     If the Accounting Firm determines that the aggregate Payments otherwise payable to a Participant should be reduced to the Reduced Amount pursuant to this Section 4.4, the Company shall promptly give the Participant notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 4.4 shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant and shall be made within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice from the Participant that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. The reduction of Payments hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by first reducing any Payments due under Section 4.2(a) of this Plan, and then any Payments due under Section 4.2(b) of this Plan, and then any benefits due under Section 4.2(c) of this Plan, and then any other Payments due in the following order: (i) reduction of cash Payments, (ii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of performance-based equity awards (based on the reverse order of the date of grant), (iii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of other equity awards (based on the reverse order of the date of grant), and (iv) reduction of any other Payments due to the Participant (with benefits or payments in any group having different payment terms being reduced on a pro-rata basis). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall be borne solely by the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Company’s obligations under this Section shall not be conditioned upon the Participant’s termination of employment. By way of example, in the event of a Change in Control which does not result in a Participant’s termination of employment or entitlement to a Separation Benefit under this Plan, but which causes the accelerated vesting of such Participant’s equity awards under a separate plan giving rise to an Excise Tax, the Company’s obligations under this Section shall apply with respect to such accelerated vesting.




	(c)     


	Definitions


	. The following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of this Section 4.4.




	(i)     “


	Accounting Firm


	” shall mean the Company’s then current independent outside auditors, or such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Plan Committee immediately prior to a Change in Control,


	provided


	 that in the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Plan Committee may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required under this Section 4.4 (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm








	11












	Exhibit 10.5








	hereunder),


	provided




	further


	 that in any case, the retention of the Accounting Firm for purposes of this Section 4.4 shall be subject to review and approval, as applicable, by the Audit Committee of the Board.









	(ii)     “


	Excise Tax


	” shall mean the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax.

	(iv)     A “


	Payment


	” shall mean any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Participant, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or otherwise.









	(v)     “


	Reduced Amount


	” shall mean the greatest amount of Payments that can be paid to a Participant that would not result in the imposition of the Excise Tax upon the Participant if the Accounting Firm determines to reduce Payments to the Participant pursuant to this Section 4.4.









	(vi)     “

	” of a Payment shall mean the economic present value of a Payment as of the date of the Change in Control (or such other date as required pursuant to Section 280G), as determined by the Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 280G of the Code using the discount rate required by Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code.




	4.5     


	Payment Obligations Absolute


	. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.2(c), the Company’s obligation to make the payments provided for in this Plan and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other claim, right or action that the Company may have against a Participant or others. In no event shall a Participant be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Participant under any of the provisions of this Plan, and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Participant obtains other employment.




	4.6     


	Section 409A


	. For purposes of this Plan, “termination of employment” or words or phrases to that effect shall mean a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article IV, if the Participant is a “specified employee,” as determined under the Company’s policy for identifying specified employees on the Date of Termination, then to the extent required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, all payments, benefits or reimbursements paid or provided under this Plan that constitute a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, that are provided as a result of a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and that would otherwise be paid or provided during the first six months following such Date of Termination shall be accumulated through and paid or provided (together with interest from the Date of Termination at the applicable federal rate under Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code in effect

	on the Date of Termination), on the first business day that is more than six months following the Participant’s Date of Termination (or, if the Participant dies during such six-month period, within 30 days after the Participant’s death). Further, to the extent that the Company determines that it is necessary, in order to comply with Section 409A with respect to any Participant who was a Participant in Plan immediately prior to the Restatement Date, the Company may require that any amount payable under this Plan be paid at the time and in the form applicable to such amount under the terms of the Plan immediately prior to the Restatement Date.

	SUCCESSOR TO COMPANY




	This Plan shall bind any successor of or to the Company, its assets or its businesses (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise), in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be obligated under this Plan if no succession had taken place. In the case of any transaction in which a successor would not by the foregoing provision or by operation of law be bound by this Plan, the Company shall require such successor expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Company’s obligations under this Plan, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. The term “


	Company


	,” as used in this Plan, shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor or assignee to the business or assets which by reason hereof becomes bound by this Plan.




	ARTICLE VI





	DURATION, AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION




	6.1     


	Duration


	. The Plan shall continue in effect from the Effective Date through December 31, 2009;


	provided, however


	, that the Plan shall renew automatically for successive one-year periods unless the Board determines, through a resolution duly adopted by a majority of the entire membership of the Board no later than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then current term, that the Plan shall not be extended, in which event the Plan shall terminate at the expiration of the then current term. In the event that a Change of Control occurs within one year following a termination, the Plan shall not so terminate. If a Change in Control occurs, this Plan shall continue in full force and effect and shall not terminate or expire until after all Participants who become entitled to any payments hereunder shall have received such payments in full.




	6.2     


	Amendment and Termination


	. The Plan may be amended in any respect by resolution adopted by a majority of the Board;


	provided, however


	, in the event that a Change in Control occurs within one year following an amendment to the Plan that would adversely affect the rights or potential rights of Participants, the amendment will not be effective. In anticipation of or on or following a Change in Control, the Plan shall no longer be subject to amendment, change, substitution, deletion, revocation or termination in any respect which adversely affects the rights of Participants without the consent of each Participant so affected. For the avoidance of doubt, removal of a Participant as a Participant (other than as a result of the Participant ceasing to be an Employee) or a decrease in the Participant’s Tier Level shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Plan which adversely affects the right of the Participant.








	13












	Exhibit 10.5








	6.3     


	Form of Amendment


	. The form of any amendment or termination of the Plan shall be a written instrument signed by a duly authorized officer or officers of the Company, certifying that the amendment or termination has been approved by the Board. An amendment of the Plan in accordance with the terms hereof shall automatically effect a corresponding amendment to all Participants’ rights and benefits hereunder. A termination of the Plan shall be in accordance with the terms hereof automatically effect a termination of all Participants’ rights and benefits hereunder.




	ARTICLE VII





	MISCELLANEOUS




	7.1     


	Determinations of the Plan Committee; Dispute Resolution


	. Any interpretation or construction of, or determination or action by, the Plan Committee with respect to the Plan and its administration shall be binding upon any and all parties and persons affected thereby, subject to the exclusive appeal procedure set forth herein, except for any interpretation or construction of, or determination or action by, the Plan Committee relating to whether a Participant has “


	Good Reason


	” to resign, which shall not be determined by the Plan Committee but instead shall be subject to de novo review. If any person eligible to receive benefits under the Plan, or claiming to be so eligible, believes he or she is entitled to benefits in an amount greater than those which he or she has received (a “


	Claimant


	”), he or she may file a claim in writing with the Teradata Benefits Committee (the “Benefits Committee”). The Benefits Committee shall review the claim and, within 90 days after the claim is filed, shall give written notice to the Claimant of the decision. If the claim is denied, the notice shall give the reason for the denial, the pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and an explanation of the claim review procedure under the Plan. Any person who has had a claim for benefits denied by the Benefits Committee shall have the right to request review by the Plan Committee. Such request must be in writing, and must be made within sixty days after such person is advised of the denial of benefits. If written request for review is not received within such sixty day period, the Claimant shall forfeit his or her right to review. The Plan Committee shall review claims that are appealed, and may hold a hearing if it deems necessary, and shall issue a written notice of the final decision. Such notice shall include specific reasons for the decision and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based. The decision shall be final and binding upon the Claimant and the Plan Committee and all other persons involved. Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Plan and not resolved through the foregoing process shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in the city of the Company’s headquarters, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. In addition, and as an exclusive alternative to the filing of a claim with the Benefits Committee, a Claimant may seek to resolve a dispute or controversy by filing a claim in arbitration without first seeking the review of the Benefits Committee or Plan Committee. The arbitrator may award only those damages which are consistent with the terms of this Plan and shall not have authority to award punitive damages. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court having jurisdiction.




	7.2     


	Indemnification


	. If a Participant institutes any legal action in seeking to obtain or enforce, or is required to defend in any legal action the validity or enforceability of, any right or








	14












	Exhibit 10.5








	benefit provided by this Plan, the Company shall reimburse the Participant (within 10 days following the Company’s receipt of an invoice from the Participant) for all reasonable costs and expenses relating to such legal action that are incurred at any time from the Effective Date through the Participant’s remaining lifetime or, if longer, through the 20th anniversary of the Effective Date, including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses incurred by such Participant, unless a court or other finder of fact having jurisdiction thereof makes a determination that the Participant’s position was frivolous. In no event shall the Participant be required to reimburse the Company for any of the costs and expenses relating to such legal action. The Company’s obligations under this Section shall survive the termination of this Plan. In order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, in no event shall the payments by the Company under this Section be made later than the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which such fees and expenses were incurred, provided, that the Participant shall have submitted an invoice for such fees and expenses at least 30 days before the end of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which such fees and expenses were incurred. The amount of such legal fees and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any given calendar year shall not affect the legal fees and expenses that the Company is obligated to pay in any other calendar year, and the Participant’s right to have the Company pay such legal fees and expenses may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.




	7.3     


	Employment Status


	. This Plan does not constitute a contract of employment or impose on the Participant or the Company any obligation to retain the Participant as an Employee, to change the status of the Participant’s employment, or to change the Company’s policies or those of its subsidiaries’ regarding termination of employment.




	7.4     


	Validity and Severability


	. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Plan shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of the Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect, and any prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.




	7.5     


	Section 409A Savings Clause


	. It is intended that the payments and benefits provided under this Plan shall either be exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that effects such intent. If any compensation or benefits provided by this Plan may result in the application of Section 409A of the Code, the Company shall modify the Plan in the least restrictive manner necessary in order to exclude such compensation from the definition of “deferred compensation” within the meaning of such Section 409A or in order to comply with the provisions of Section 409A, other applicable provision(s) of the Code and/or any rules, regulations or other regulatory guidance issued under such statutory provisions and without any diminution in the value of the payments to the Participants. Although the Company will use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation, interest and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under this Plan is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Company, its subsidiaries nor their respective directors, officers, employees or advisers shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by a Participant (or any other individual claiming a benefit through the Participant) as a result of this Plan.

	Exhibit 10.5








	7.6     


	Governing Law


	. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Plan shall in all respects be governed by the laws of Delaware, without reference to principles of conflict of law, and to the extent not preempted by ERISA.




	7.7     


	Trust


	. The Compensation Committee may establish a trust with a bank trustee, for the purpose of paying benefits under this Plan. If so established, the trust shall be a grantor trust subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors and shall, immediately prior to a Change in Control, be funded in cash or common stock of the Company or such other assets as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate with an amount equal to 120 percent of the aggregate benefits payable under this Plan assuming that all Participants in the Plan incurred a termination of employment entitling them to Separation Benefits immediately following the Change in Control,


	provided


	, that, in the event that such funding would result in the imposition of taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code with respect to any current or former Section 16 officers or any “covered employees” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the trust shall not be funded with respect to such individuals.




	7.8     


	Withholding


	. The Company may withhold from any amount payable or benefit provided under this Plan such Federal, state, local, foreign and other taxes as are required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.




	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned hereby certifies that this amended and restated Plan was approved and adopted by the Board on the Restatement Date and, therefore, Teradata has caused this amended and restated Plan to be executed this 30th day of January, 2017.

	Exhibit A





	GENERAL RELEASE













	1.






	In consideration of the payments and benefits to which


	[●]


	 (the "Participant") is entitled from the Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan (the "Plan") as set forth on Schedule A hereto, the Participant for himself, his heirs, administrators, representatives, executors, successors and assigns (collectively "Releasors") does hereby irrevocably and unconditionally release, acquit and forever discharge Teradata Corporation (the "Company") and its subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions (the "Affiliated Entities") and their respective predecessors and successors and their respective, current and former, trustees, officers, directors, partners, shareholders, agents, employees, consultants, independent contractors and representatives, including without limitation all persons acting by, through, under or in concert with any of them (collectively, "Releasees"), and each of them from any and all charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, remedies, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs) of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, whether in law or equity and whether arising under federal, state or local law and in particular including any claim for discrimination based upon race, color, ethnicity, sex, age [(including the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967)], national origin, religion, disability, or any other unlawful criterion or circumstance, relating to the Participant's employment or termination thereof, which the Participant and Releasors had, now have, or may have in the future against each or any of the Releasees from the beginning of the world until the date hereof (the "Execution Date").







	Without limiting the foregoing Paragraph, the Participant represents that he or she understands that this Agreement specifically releases and waives any claims of age discrimination, known or unknown, that the Participant may have against the Releasees as of the date the Participant signs this Agreement. This Agreement specifically includes a waiver of rights and claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, and the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act. The Participant acknowledges that as of the date he or she signs this Agreement, the Participant may have certain rights or claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §626, and the Participant voluntarily relinquishes any such rights or claims by signing this Agreement.













	2.






	[The Participant acknowledges that: (i) this entire agreement is written in a manner calculated to be understood by him; (ii) he has been advised to consult with an attorney before executing this agreement; (iii) he was given a period of [forty-five][twenty-one] days within which to consider this agreement; and (iv) to the extent he executes this agreement before the expiration of the [forty-five][twenty-one]-day period, he does so knowingly and voluntarily and only after consulting his attorney. The Participant shall have the right to cancel and revoke this agreement during a period of seven days following the Execution Date, and this agreement shall not become effective, and no money shall be paid hereunder, until the day after the expiration of such seven-day period. The seven-day period of revocation shall commence upon the Execution Date. In order to revoke this agreement, the Participant shall











	17












	Exhibit 10.5








	deliver to the Company, prior to the expiration of said seven-day period, a written notice of revocation. Upon such revocation, this agreement shall be null and void and of no further force or effect.]













	3.






	Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, this Release shall not affect: the obligations of the Company set forth in the Plan or other obligations that, in each case, by their terms, are to be performed after the date hereof (including, without limitation, obligations to Participant under any stock option, stock award or agreements or obligations under any pension plan or other benefit or deferred compensation plan, all of which shall remain in effect in accordance with their terms); obligations to indemnify the Participant respecting acts or omissions in connection with the Participant's service as a director, officer or employee of the Affiliated Entities; obligations with respect to insurance coverage under any of the Affiliated Entities' (or any of their respective successors) directors' and officers' liability insurance policies; or any right Participant may have to obtain contribution in the event of the entry of judgment against Participant as a result of any act or failure to act for which both Participant and any of the Affiliated Entities are jointly responsible.
















	4.






	The Participant shall not, at any time during the 12-month period following the Participant's Date of Termination (the "Restricted Period"), without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, solicit or recruit (whether as an employee, officer, director or independent contractor) any person who is, or was at any time during the three months prior to such solicitation or recruitment, an employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Affiliated Entities. Further, during the Restricted Period, the Participant shall not take any action that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of encouraging or inducing any employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the Company or of its Affiliated Entities to cease their relationship with the Company or any of its Affiliated Entities for any reason. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a general solicitation of the public for employment shall not violate the foregoing provisions of this Section so long as such general solicitation does not target any employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Affiliated Entities.
















	5.






	The Participant shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or its Affiliated Entities, and their respective businesses, which information, knowledge or data shall have been obtained by the Participant during the Participant's employment by the Company and its Affiliated Entities and which information, knowledge or data shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Participant or representatives of the Participant in violation of this Agreement). After termination of the Participant's employment with the Company, the Participant shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those persons designated by the Company.
















	6.






	The Participant understands that if the Participant breaches Sections 4 or 5, the Company may sustain irreparable injury and may not have an adequate remedy at law. As a result, the











	18












	Exhibit 10.5








	Participant agrees that in the event of the Participant's breach of Sections 4 or 5, the Company may, in addition to any other remedies available to it, bring an action or actions for injunction, specific performance, or both, and have entered a temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, or order compelling specific performance.













	7.






	Nothing contained in this Agreement limits the Participant’s ability to file a charge or complaint with any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a "Government Agency"). In addition, nothing in this Agreement or any other Company agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit the Participant from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any Government Agency or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. The Participant does not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures, and the Participant is not required to notify the Company that the Participant has made such reports or disclosures. If the Participant files any charge or complaint with any Government Agency, and if the Government Agency pursues any claim on the Participant’s behalf, or if any other third party pursues any claim on the Participant’s behalf, the Participant waives any right to monetary or other individualized relief (either individually, or as part of any collective or class action) that arises out of alleged facts or circumstances on or before the effective date of this Agreement; provided that nothing in this Agreement limits any right the Participant may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission or other Government Agency.
















	8.






	This Agreement shall be construed, enforced and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its principles of conflict of laws.
















	9.






	It is the intention of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under all applicable laws and public policies, but that the unenforceability or the modification to conform with such laws or public policies of any provision hereof shall not render unenforceable or impair the remainder of the Agreement. Accordingly, if any provision shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable either in whole or in part, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to delete or modify as necessary the invalid or unenforceable provisions to alter the balance of this Agreement in order to render the same valid and enforceable.
















	10.

Any Eligible Employee designated as such by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer shall be a Level II Participant.




	    




	(b)    


	Participation


	. As a condition to becoming a Participant and being entitled to the benefits and protections provided under the Plan, each Eligible Employee must execute and deliver a Participation Agreement to the Company within the later of (i) forty-five (45) days after the date such individual is designated as an Eligible Employee pursuant to Section 3(a), or (ii) fifteen (15) days after the Eligible Employee first receives the Participation Agreement to be executed.









	(c)    


	Duration of Participation


	. An Eligible Employee participating in this Plan shall cease to be a Participant in this Plan if: (i) the Eligible Employee ceases to be employed by the Company or an Affiliate for any reason, unless such Eligible Employee is then entitled to a severance benefit as provided in Section 4 of this Plan; or (ii) the Plan Committee removes the Eligible Employee as a Participant in accordance with Section 16 hereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,








	6

















	a Participant who is entitled to a severance benefit as provided in Section 4(b) of this Plan and/or Accrued Benefits or Other Benefits as provided in Section 4(c) of this Plan shall remain a Participant in this Plan until the amounts and benefits payable under this Plan have been paid or provided to the Participant in full. Any severance benefits to be provided to a Participant under this Plan are subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, including Sections 5 and 7 hereof, and the terms and conditions of Sections 5 and 7 hereof shall survive, for the periods set forth therein, the termination of a Participant’s employment and participation in this Plan.




	    




	(d)     


	No Employment Rights


	. Participation in the Plan does not alter the status of a Participant as an at-will employee, and nothing in the Plan will limit or affect in any manner the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate the employment or adjust the compensation of a Participant at any time and for any reason (with or without Cause).




	    






	4.     Severance Benefits.









	(a)     


	Any Termination of Employment


	. If a Participant’s employment with the Company and its Affiliates is terminated for any reason or no reason, then:









	(i)    


	Accrued Benefits


	.


	The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Participant the sum of: (A) the Participant’s earned but unpaid base salary through the Date of Termination; (B) the amount of any annual incentive bonus that has been earned by the Participant for a completed fiscal year preceding the Date of Termination in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company’s applicable annual incentive bonus plan, but that has not yet been paid to the Participant; (C) any accrued but unused vacation pay through the Date of Termination; and (D) any reasonable unreimbursed business expenses actually and properly incurred by the Participant in connection with carrying out his or her duties with the Company and its Affiliates through the Separation Date in accordance with the Company’s applicable business expense reimbursement policies, which expenses must be submitted by the Participant to the Company with supporting receipts and/or documentation no later than ten (10) calendar days after the Date of Termination (the sum of the amounts described in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) shall be referred to as the “


	Accrued Benefits


	”). The Accrued Benefits shall be paid in a single lump sum within 30 calendar days after the Date of Termination.









	(ii)


	    


	Other Benefits


	. To the extent not theretofore paid or provided, and subject to Section 8(b) hereof, the Company shall pay or provide, or cause to be paid or provided, to the Participant (or his or her estate) any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Participant is eligible to receive under any plan, program, policy, practice, contract or agreement of the Company, including the right to continued participation in the Company’s medical, dental and vision care plans to the extent provided under COBRA (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the “


	Other Benefits


	”) in accordance with the terms and normal procedures of each such plan, program, policy or practice or contract or agreement, based on accrued and vested benefits through the Date of Termination.









	(b)    


	Qualified Termination


	. Subject to the Participant’s compliance with Sections 5 and 7 hereof, in the event of a Participant’s Qualified Termination, then, except as otherwise provided








	7

















	in such Participant’s Participation Agreement, and in all cases subject to Section 20 hereof, such Participant shall be entitled to the compensation and benefits set forth in this Section 4(b):









	(i)


	    


	Severance Pay


	.


	 The Company shall pay to the Participant an amount equal to the product of (A) the Participant’s Severance Multiple, and (B) the sum of the Participant’s Annual Base Salary and Target Annual Bonus. Any severance payable pursuant to this Section 4(b)(i) shall be paid in substantially equal installments in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll procedures over the Participant’s Benefit Continuation Period, with the first installment commencing on the first payroll date to occur on or immediately after the date the Release becomes effective and irrevocable in accordance with its terms. The first such installment shall include all amounts accrued after the Date of Termination to the date of such installment and the remaining installments shall be payable as otherwise scheduled assuming that payments had begun on the first regular payroll date after the Date of Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant’s Qualified Termination occurs within two (2) years after a Change in Control that also constitutes a “change in control event” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(i)(5), then such Participant’s severance pay pursuant to this Section 4(b)(i) shall be paid in a single lump sum within seventy (70) days after the Date of Termination.









	(ii)    


	Pro-Rated Annual Incentive


	.


	The Participant shall be eligible to receive a lump sum payment (but only to the extent that the Participant is not otherwise entitled to receive a partial payment for the year of termination under the terms of the applicable annual incentive bonus plan for the period prior to the Date of Termination) equal to the product of (A) the Participant’s Target Annual Bonus and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the bonus year in which the Date of Termination occurs through the Date of Termination and the denominator of which is 365 (the “


	Pro-Rated Annual Incentive


	”), which amount shall be paid within seventy (70) days after the Date of Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Participant who participates in the Company’s Management Incentive Plan and whose Qualified Termination occurs prior to a Change in Control, the Pro-Rated Annual Incentive of such Participant shall be paid at the same time that payments are made to other participants in the Company’s Management Incentive Plan for the fiscal year during which the Date of Termination occurs whose employment did not terminate during such fiscal year, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Management Incentive Plan (including the Committee’s determination of the Company’s earnings before income taxes for the full fiscal year and certification of the amount payable thereunder, so that such Participant’s Pro-Rated Annual Incentive may not exceed an amount equal to the applicable percentage (as set forth in the Management Incentive Plan) of the Company’s actual earnings before income taxes for the full fiscal year as defined in such plan). The Pro-Rated Annual Incentive paid to a Participant hereunder shall be in lieu of any annual incentive bonus that the Participant otherwise would have been entitled to receive for that fiscal year.









	(iii)


	    


	Health Care Coverage


	.


	Subject to the Participant’s timely election of continued medical, dental and vision care coverage under COBRA, the Company will subsidize the Participant’s COBRA premiums to continue his or her coverage (including coverage for the Participant’s eligible dependents, if applicable) (the “


	COBRA Premiums


	”) during the Benefit Continuation Period, such that Executive will only be obligated to pay the contributions required of active employees during the Benefit Continuation Period. The Benefit Continuation Period shall








	8

















	run concurrently with the eighteen-month COBRA continuation period. During the Benefit Continuation Period, an amount equal to the applicable COBRA Premiums (or such other amounts as may be required by law) will be included in Participant’s income for tax purposes and the Company may withhold taxes from the Participant’s other compensation for this purpose. The Company specifically reserves the right at its sole discretion to amend, suspend, discontinue or terminate its medical, dental and vision care plan or any or all benefits under such plan at any time, without either the prior consent of, or any prior notice to, any Participant, and to make or amend rules for administration of such plan;


	provided, however


	, that if the Company terminates its medical, dental and vision care plan during a Participant’s Benefit Continuation Period, then, within 30 calendar days after the termination of such plan, the Company will make a single lump sum cash payment to such Participant equal to the cost that the Company otherwise would have incurred hereunder (in the absence of the termination of such plan) to subsidize the Participant’s COBRA Premiums for the period of time from the effective date of termination of such plan through the last day of the Participant’s Benefit Continuation Period. After the Benefit Continuation Period and during the remainder of the eighteen-month COBRA continuation period, a Participant shall be entitled to elect continued medical, dental and vision care coverage as may be provided pursuant to COBRA (including coverage for his or her eligible dependents, if applicable), provided that the Participant pays the full premiums (


	i.e.,


	 without subsidy from the Company) for such continued coverage after the Benefit Continuation Period.









	(iv)    


	Outplacement


	. During the Participant’s Benefit Continuation Period, the Participant will be entitled to participate in the Company’s outplacement assistance program for officers and senior executives, with outplacement services provided by the Company’s selected outplacement services provider, and subject to the same terms and conditions as applicable to Company officers and senior executives in the event of a reduction-in-force.









	(v)


	    


	Equity Awards


	. Each outstanding equity award of the Company granted to the Participant shall be treated as provided in the applicable Company equity plan and award agreement;


	provided, however


	, that, unless the applicable equity plan and award agreement would provide a greater benefit: (i) the Participant shall be entitled to pro-rated vesting of all outstanding service-based and performance-based restricted share unit awards granted by the Company, determined under the pro-ration methodology employed by the Company from time-to-time and, in the case of any performance-based restricted share unit awards for which the applicable performance period has not been completed as of the Date of Termination, subject to actual achievement of the applicable performance goals, as determined by the Committee after the end of the applicable performance period; and (ii) if the Participant is at least age 55 at the time of his or her Qualifying Termination, the Participant shall receive an extra year of vesting credit for purposes of calculating the vesting of the Participant’s outstanding service-based restricted share units and stock options granted by the Company (but not for purposes of calculating the vesting of the Participant’s outstanding performance-based restricted share units granted by the Company).









	(c)     


	Other Terminations


	. If a Participant’s employment is terminated by the Company (and any Affiliate) for Cause, for disability or as a result of the Participant’s death, or if the Participant voluntarily terminates his or her employment for any reason (other than for Good Reason in a Qualifying Termination), then the Company shall pay or provide to the Participant the Accrued








	9

















	Benefits, payable in accordance with Section 4(a)(i) of this Plan, and the Other Benefits set forth in Section 4(a)(ii) of this Plan, and no further amounts shall be payable to the Participant under this Section 4 after the Date of Termination.









	(d)    


	Notice of Termination


	. Any termination of a Participant’s employment by the Company and its Affiliates for Cause shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the Participant in accordance with Section 15. Any failure by the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Cause shall not waive any right of the Company hereunder or preclude the Company from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Company’s rights under this Plan or in any other forum.









	(e)    


	Resignation from All Positions


	. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, upon the termination of a Participant’s employment for any reason, unless otherwise requested by the Company, the Participant shall immediately resign from all positions (including directorships) that he or she holds or has ever held with the Company and its Affiliates. By executing the Participation Agreement, each Participant agrees to execute any and all documentation to effectuate such resignations upon request by the Company, but he or she shall be treated for all purposes as having so resigned upon termination of his or her employment, regardless of when or whether he or she executes any such documentation.









	(f)    


	Reduction in Certain Payments Contingent on a Change in Control


	.









	(i) In the event that it shall be determined by the Accounting Firm that any Payment to a Participant would be subject to the Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine whether to reduce the aggregate amount of the Payments payable to such Participant to the Reduced Amount. The Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount only if the Accounting Firm determines that the Participant would have a greater Net After-Tax Benefit if the Participant's Payments were reduced to the Reduced Amount. If instead the Accounting Firm determines that the Participant would have a greater Net After-Tax Benefit if the Participant's Payments were not reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Participant shall receive all Payments to which the Participant is entitled.




	(ii)     If the Accounting Firm determines that the aggregate Payments otherwise payable to a Participant should be reduced to the Reduced Amount pursuant to this Section 4(f), the Company shall promptly give the Participant notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 4(f) shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant and shall be made within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice from the Participant that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. The reduction of Payments hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by first reducing any Payments due under Section 4(b)(i) of this Plan, and then any Payments due under Section 4(b)(ii) of this Plan, and then any benefits due under Section 4(b)(iii) of this Plan, and then any benefits due under Section 4(b)(iv) of this Plan, and then by cancellation of any accelerated vesting of performance-based equity awards (based on the reverse order of the date of grant), and then by cancellation of accelerated vesting of other equity awards (based on the reverse order of the date of grant). All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 4(f) shall be borne solely by the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Company’s








	10

















	obligations under this Section 4(f) shall not be conditioned upon the Participant’s termination of employment. By way of example, in the event of a Change in Control which does not result in a Participant’s termination of employment or entitlement to severance benefits under this Plan, but which causes the accelerated vesting of such Participant’s equity awards under a separate plan giving rise to an Excise Tax, the Company’s obligations under this Section 4(f) shall apply with respect to such accelerated vesting.




	(iii)     


	Definitions


	. The following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of this Section 4(f).

	Payment


	” shall mean any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Participant, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or otherwise.

	” of a Payment shall mean the economic present value of a Payment as of the date of the Change in Control (or such other date as required pursuant to Section 280G), as determined by the Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 280G of the Code using the discount rate required by Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code.

	  As a condition to participation in this Plan, and by signing his or her Participation Agreement, each Participant shall acknowledge and agree as follows:









	(a)    


	Confidential and Trade Secret Information


	. Each Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Participant has access to highly confidential, proprietary and non-public information of the Company and its customers, including strategic plans, customer lists, research and development plans, and other information not made available to the general public and from which the Company derives value. For purposes of this Plan, this information is defined as “


	Trade Secret Information


	.” Each Participant further acknowledges and agrees that (A) he or she is subject to the confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations the Participant agreed to in connection with his or her employment with the Company, in which the Participant agreed not to disclose the Company’s Trade Secret Information or confidential information during or following the termination of employment, and (B) state law and federal law (


	e.g.


	, the Economic Espionage Act, the Defend Trade Secrets Act) also prohibit the unlawful use or misappropriation of confidential or Trade Secret Information. By signing his or her Participation Agreement, each Participant shall reaffirm his or her obligations under these contractual, common law and statutory provisions not to disclose, use, or otherwise leverage any Company confidential, proprietary or Trade Secret Information or related documents in any capacity.

	Equity Awards


	”) and accepting benefits thereunder, the Participant agreed in the award agreements governing the Equity Awards (the “


	Equity Agreements


	”) that during his or her employment with the Company and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, for a period of 12 months after the Separation Date (or if applicable law mandates a maximum time that is shorter than twelve months, then for a period of time equal to that shorter maximum period), regardless of the reason for termination, the Participant will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company: (i) render services directly or indirectly to, or become employed by, any Competing Organization (as defined below) to the extent such services or employment involves the development, manufacture, marketing, sale, advertising or servicing of any product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to, or competes with, a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, serviced or otherwise provided by the Company to its customers and upon








	12

















	which the Participant worked or in which the Participant participated during the last twelve (12) months of employment with the Company (


	PROVIDED THAT THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7(b)(i) SHALL NOT APPLY TO A PARTICIPANT EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA


	); (ii) directly or indirectly recruit, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any exempt employee of the Company to terminate his or her employment with or otherwise cease his or her relationship with the Company (

	); or (iii) solicit the business of any firm or company with which the Participant worked during the preceding twelve (12) months of employment at the Company, if such firm or company was a customer of the Company, using Trade Secret Information (Sections 7(b)(i)-(iii) collectively, and to the extent applicable to a Participant, the “


	Applicable Restrictions


	”). The Equity Agreements provide that if the Participant breaches any of the Applicable Restrictions, then in addition to any liability the Participant may have for damages arising from such breach and in addition to any other remedies available to the Company under the Equity Agreements or otherwise, and to the extent permitted under applicable law: (A) any unvested restricted share units will be immediately forfeited, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Participant agreed to pay to the Company the fair market value of any share units that vested and that were paid during the 12 months prior to the Participant’s Date of Termination, and (B) the Participant’s outstanding stock options will be cancelled, and the Participant will pay to the Company the excess of the fair market value on the date of exercise over the exercise price of any option shares received in connection with the exercise of a stock option on or after the date which is 12 months prior to the date of the breach. By signing his or her Participation Agreement, each Participant shall agrees that if he or she breaches any of the Applicable Restrictions or any of the terms of this Section 7, the Company is entitled to seek all of the remedies provided in the Equity Agreements and any other remedies available to it.




	(c)    


	Competing Organization


	. As used in this Section 7 “


	Competing Organization


	” means a person or organization which is engaged in or about to become engaged in research on or development, production, marketing, leasing, selling or servicing of a product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, serviced or otherwise provided by the Company to its customers and is therefore a competitor of the Company. This includes but is not limited to persons or organizations identified as a “Competing Organization” in a list prepared by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company for the year in which the Participant’s Date of Termination occurs. This list is maintained by the Company’s Law Department.









	(d)    


	Non-Disparagement


	. A Participant shall not disparage the Company or any of its Affiliates or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, shareholders, successors and assigns (both individually and in their official capacities with the Company and its Affiliates) or any of their goods, services, employees, customers, business relationships, reputation or financial condition. The Company agrees that, following the Date of Termination, it will instruct its executive officers not to disparage a Participant or the Participant’s business relationships or reputation. For purposes of this Plan, to “disparage” means to make statements, whether oral or written, whether direct or indirect, whether true or false and whether acting alone or through any other person, that cast the subject of the statement in a critical or unfavorable light or that otherwise cause damage








	13

















	to, or intend to embarrass, the subject of the statement. Nothing in the foregoing will preclude either party from providing truthful disclosures as required by, or to the extent, if any, expressly authorized or exempted by, applicable law or legal process, including participation in any proceeding or investigation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, or other state or federal agency.









	(e)    


	Return of Property


	. At a Participant’s Date of Termination, or at any time upon the Company’s request, the Participant shall deliver to the Company, and the Participant shall cease all other use, copying, transfer, disclosure, alteration, damage, destruction and deletion to the extent not otherwise expressly provided pursuant to this Plan or expressly authorized in writing by an authorized representative of the Company, the original and all copies of all documents, electronic files, access registrations, access credentials, records, property and other assets of any nature whatsoever which are in the Participant’s possession or control and which are the property of the Company and its Affiliates or which relate to the business activities, facilities or customers of the Company and its Affiliates, including any records, documents or property created by the Participant in said capacity. Further, each Participant agrees to attend an exit interview upon termination of employment to ensure compliance with the terms of this Plan.









	(f)    


	Cooperation


	. During his or her employment with the Company and its Affiliates and thereafter, each Participant shall cooperate with the Company and its Affiliates, without additional consideration, in any internal investigation or administrative, regulatory, or judicial proceeding as reasonably requested by the Company including, without limitation, the Participant’s being available to the Company and its Affiliates upon reasonable notice for interviews and factual investigations, appearing at the Company’s request to give testimony without requiring service of a subpoena or other legal process, volunteering to the Company all pertinent information, and turning over to the Company all relevant and potentially relevant documents and records that are or may come into the Participant’s possession, all at times and on schedules that are reasonably consistent with the Participant’s other permitted activities and commitments, if the Participant is then employed by the Company, and otherwise taking into account the Participant’s reasonable business obligations.









	(g)    


	Remedies


	. By signing his or her Participation Agreement, each Participant shall acknowledge and agree that, in the event of the Participant’s breach of any provision of this Section 7, the Company will sustain irreparable injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, by signing his or her Participation Agreement, each Participant shall agree that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by the Participant of any of the provisions of this Section 7, the Company, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, may (i) apply to any court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security), (ii) cease any further payments or benefits under this Plan, and (iii) require the Participant to repay any severance benefits provided by the Company hereunder. Nothing in this Section 7(g) will be deemed to limit the Company’s remedies at law or in equity for any breach by the Participant of any of the provisions of this Section 7 that may be pursued or availed of by the Company.













	14

















	(h)    


	Whistleblower Protections


	. Nothing contained in this Plan shall limit a Participant’s ability to file a charge or complaint with any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “


	Government Agency


	”). In addition, nothing in this Plan or any other Company agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit a Participant from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any Government Agency or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. A Participant does not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures, and a Participant is not required to notify the Company that the Participant has made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Plan shall limit any right a Participant may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission or other Government Agency.









	8.    Effect on Other Plans, Agreements and Benefits


	.









	(a)    


	Relation to Other Benefits


	. Unless otherwise provided herein, nothing in this Plan shall prevent or limit a Participant’s continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or its Affiliates for which the Participant may qualify, nor, except as explicitly set forth in this Plan, shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as a Participant may have under any other contract or agreement with the Company or any of its Affiliates. Any economic or other benefit to a Participant under this Plan will not be taken into account in determining any benefits to which the Participant may be entitled under any profit-sharing, retirement or other benefit or compensation plan maintained by the Company and its Affiliates (except to the extent provided otherwise in any such plan with respect to Accrued Benefits).









	(b)    


	Non-Duplication


	. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8, and except as specifically provided below, any severance payments or benefits received by a Participant pursuant to this Plan shall be in lieu of any benefits under the Teradata Reduction-in-Force Program or any other severance or reduction-in-force plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement maintained by the Company or an Affiliate (not including an equity award agreement, retirement or deferred compensation plan or similar plan or agreement which may contain provisions operative on a termination of the Participant's employment or which may incidentally refer to accelerated vesting or accelerated payment upon a termination of employment) and in lieu of in lieu of any severance or separation pay benefit that may be required under applicable law; provided, however, that if a Participant’s employment with the Company and its Affiliates is terminated in circumstances under which the Participant becomes entitled to severance payments or benefits pursuant to the Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan or its successor (the “


	Change in Control Plan


	”), then the Participant shall not be entitled to any severance payments or benefits under this Plan as a result of such termination of employment and, in lieu of, and not in duplication of, any severance payments or benefits the Participant would otherwise to be entitled to receive under this Plan, the Participant shall receive the severance payments or benefits to which the Participant is entitled under the Change in Control Plan, payable or provided under the terms, and subject to the conditions, of the Change in Control Plan.









	9.    Administration


	. The Plan Committee shall have complete discretion to interpret where necessary all provisions of the Plan (including, without limitation, by supplying omissions








	15

















	from, correcting deficiencies in, or resolving inconsistencies or ambiguities in, the language of the Plan), to make factual findings with respect to any issue arising under the Plan, to determine the rights and status under the Plan of Eligible Employees, Participants or other persons, to resolve questions (including factual questions) or disputes arising under the Plan and to make any determinations with respect to the benefits payable under the Plan and the persons entitled thereto as may be necessary for the purposes of the Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Plan Committee is hereby granted the authority (a) to determine whether a particular employee is an Eligible Employee or a Participant; and (b) to determine if a person is entitled to benefits hereunder and, if so, the amount and duration of such benefits. Any interpretation or construction of, or determination or action by, the Plan Committee with respect to the Plan and its administration shall be final and binding upon any and all parties and persons affected thereby, subject to the exclusive appeal procedure set forth herein. To the extent permitted by law, the Plan Committee may delegate to one or more officers of the Company, subject to such terms as the Plan Committee shall determine, authority to administer all or any portion of the Plan, or the authority to perform certain functions with respect to the Plan, including administrative functions. In the event of such delegation, all references to the Plan Committee in this Plan (other than such references in the immediately preceding sentence) shall be deemed references to such officers as it relates to those aspects of the Plan that have been delegated.









	10.    Claims for Benefits.











	(a)    


	Qualified Termination not in Connection with a Change in Control


	. Except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 10(b) hereof in the case of a Change in Control, any Participant or beneficiary who wishes to file a claim for benefits under the Plan shall file his or her claim in writing with the Teradata Benefits Committee (the “


	Benefits Committee


	”), and any such Claimant’s rights to pursue or appeal such claim shall be governed exclusively by this Section 10(a). The Benefits Committee shall review any such claim and, within 90 days after the claim is filed, shall give written notice to the Claimant of the decision. If the claim is denied, the notice shall give the reason for the denial, the pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and an explanation of the claim review procedure under this Section 10(a). Any such Claimant who has had a claim for benefits denied by the Benefits Committee shall have the right to request further review by the Benefits Committee. Such request must be in writing, and must be made within sixty (60) days after such person is advised of the denial of benefits. If written request for review is not received within such sixty day period, the Claimant shall forfeit any such right to review. The Benefits Committee shall review claims that are appealed in accordance with this Section 10(a), and may hold a hearing if it deems necessary, and shall issue a written notice of the final decision. Such notice shall include specific reasons for the decision and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based. The decision by the Benefits Committee upon such appeal shall be final and binding upon the Claimant and the Benefits Committee and all other persons involved.









	(b)    


	Qualified Termination in Connection with a Change in Control


	. If and only if a Change in Control has occurred, a Participant whose Qualified Termination occurred within two (2) years after or within six (6) months before the Change in Control (or such Participant’s








	16

















	beneficiary) who wishes to file a claim for benefits under the Plan shall file his or her claim in writing with the Benefits Committee, and any such Claimant’s rights to pursue or appeal such claim shall be governed exclusively by this Section 10(b). The Benefits Committee shall review any such claim and, within 90 days after the claim is filed, shall give written notice to the Claimant of the decision. If the claim is denied, the notice shall give the reason for the denial, the pertinent provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based, a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and an explanation of the claim review procedure under this Section 10(b). Any such Claimant who has had a claim for benefits denied by the Benefits Committee shall have the right to request review by the Plan Committee. Such request must be in writing, and must be made within sixty (60) days after such person is advised of the denial of benefits (or, if later, within sixty (60) days after the Change in Control). If written request for review is not received within such sixty day period, the Claimant shall forfeit any such right to review. The Plan Committee shall review claims that are appealed in accordance with this Section 10(b), and may hold a hearing if it deems necessary, and shall issue a written notice of the final decision. Such notice shall include specific reasons for the decision and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based. The decision shall be final and binding upon the Claimant and the Plan Committee and all other persons involved. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7(g) hereof, any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Plan in circumstances covered by this Section 10(b) and not resolved through the foregoing process shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in the city of the Company’s headquarters (except to the extent, if any, that the Participant objects in writing to that arbitration location within thirty (30) days after initiation of the arbitration claim and applicable law requires that the arbitration be held in the Participant’s state of employment with the Company, in which event the arbitration shall be held in such state in conformity with such law at a location determined by the American Arbitration Association), in accordance with the then-current applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. In addition, and as an exclusive alternative to the filing of a claim with the Benefits Committee, a Claimant whose Qualified Termination occurred within two (2) years after or within six (6) months before the Change in Control may seek to resolve a dispute or controversy by filing a claim in arbitration without first seeking the review of the Benefits Committee or the Plan Committee. The arbitrator may award only those payments which are consistent with the terms of this Plan and shall not have authority to award punitive damages. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court having jurisdiction.









	11.    Participants Deemed to Accept Plan.


	  By accepting any payment or benefit under the Plan, each Participant and each person claiming under or through any such Participant shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated his or her acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and any action taken under the Plan by the Plan Committee, the Company or its Affiliates, in any case in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan.









	12.    Successors.




	    




	(a)    


	Company Successors


	.




	This Plan shall bind any successor of the Company, its assets or its businesses (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise), in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be obligated under this Plan if no








	17

















	succession had taken place. In the case of any transaction in which a successor would not by the foregoing provision or by operation of law be bound by this Plan, the Company shall require such successor expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Company’s obligations under this Plan, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.




	    




	(b)    


	Participant Successors


	. The rights of a Participant to receive any benefits hereunder shall not be assignable, transferable or delegable, whether by pledge, creation of a security interest or otherwise, other than by a transfer by his or her will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, in the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section 12(b), the Company shall have no liability or obligation to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned, transferred or delegated.











	13.


	    


	Unfunded Status.


	All payments pursuant to the Plan shall be made from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established or other segregation of assets made to assure payment. No Participant or other person shall have under any circumstances any interest in any particular property or assets of the Company as a result of participating in the Plan.











	14.    Withholding.


	 The Company and its Affiliates may withhold from any amounts payable under this Plan all federal, state, city or other taxes as the Company and its Affiliates are required to withhold pursuant to any law or government regulation or ruling.











	15.    Notices.


	  Any notice provided for in this Plan shall be in writing and shall be either personally delivered, sent by reputable overnight carrier or mailed by first class mail, return receipt requested, to the recipient.

	16.    Amendment and Termination.


	 Except as otherwise provided herein, the Company expressly reserves the right to terminate the Plan and to amend the Plan in whole or in part, without








	18

















	either the consent of or any prior notification to Participants, including, without limitation, to remove individuals as Participants or to modify all or any benefits under Section 4 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) no amendment of the Plan shall impair the rights of a Participant who previously has incurred a Qualified Termination unless such amendment is agreed to in a writing signed by the Participant (or his or her legal representative) and the Company; (b) the Company shall provide written notice to each affected Participant, in accordance with Section 15 hereof, at least one hundred eighty (180) calendar days prior to the effectiveness of the termination of the Plan or the removal of an individual as a Participant in the Plan; (c) in the event that a Change in Control occurs within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days following an amendment to the Plan that would adversely affect the rights or potential rights of Participants, the amendment will not be effective; and (d) in anticipation of or on or within two (2) years after a Change in Control, the Plan shall not be subject to amendment, change, substitution, deletion, revocation or termination in any respect which adversely affects the rights of Participants (including the removal of an individual as a Participant) without the consent of each Participant so affected.











	17.    Governing Law.


	  This Plan shall be governed, construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law principles.




	 






	18.


	    


	Severability.


	 Whenever possible, each provision of this Plan shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any part of any provision of this Plan is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such part shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability only, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Plan.









	19.    Headings


	. Headings in this Plan are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in the construction of the provisions hereof.











	20.    Section 409A.









	(a)    


	In General


	. Section 409A of the Code (“


	Section 409A


	”) imposes payment restrictions on “nonqualified deferred compensation” (potentially including




	payments owed to a Participant upon termination of employment). Failure to comply with these restrictions could result in negative tax consequences to a Participant, including immediate taxation, interest and a 20% additional income tax. It is the Company’s intent that this Plan be exempt from the application of, or otherwise comply with, the requirements of Section 409A. Specifically, any taxable benefits or payments provided under this Plan are intended to be separate payments that qualify for the “short-term deferral” exception to Section 409A to the maximum extent possible, and to the extent they do not so qualify, are intended to qualify for the separation pay exceptions to Section 409A to the maximum extent possible. To the extent that none of these exceptions applies, and to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary to comply with Section 409A (


	e.g


	., if the Participant is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A), then notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, all amounts that would otherwise be paid or provided to such Participant during the first six months following the Date of Termination shall instead be








	19

















	accumulated through and paid or provided (without interest) on the first business day that is more than six months after the Participant’s separation from service.









	(b)    


	Separation from Service


	. A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Plan providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits subject to Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A and the Participant is no longer providing services (at a level that would preclude the occurrence of a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A) to the Company or its Affiliates as an employee or consultant, and for purposes of any such provision of this Plan, references to the “Date of Termination,” a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.









	(c)    


	In-Kind Benefits and Reimbursements


	. To the extent that any taxable in-kind benefit or reimbursement provided under this Plan is not exempt from the requirements of Section 409A, then the following rules shall apply: (i) the amount of any such in-kind benefit or reimbursement to which a Participant may be entitled during a calendar year will not affect the amount to be provided in any other calendar year, (ii) any such in-kind benefit or reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (iii) any such reimbursement shall be paid no later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the reimbursable expense, if any, was incurred.









	(d)    


	Payment Dates


	. Whenever a payment under this Plan specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days, the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company. In the event the payment period under this Plan for any nonqualified deferred compensation commences in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year, the payments shall not be paid (or installments commenced) until the later of the first payroll date of the second calendar year, or the date that such Release becomes effective and irrevocable, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A. For purposes of Section 409A, a Participant’s right to receive installment payments pursuant to this Plan shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.









	(e)    


	Acceleration,




	etc


	. The payments and benefits provided under this Plan may not be deferred, accelerated, extended, paid out or modified in a manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A upon a Participant. To the extent that the Company determines that any payment under this Plan would be considered an impermissible acceleration or deferral of payment of nonqualified deferred compensation in violation of Section 409A, the Company will instead make such payment on the earliest date that it may be made without violating Section 409A. Further, to the extent that the Company determines that it is necessary, in order to comply with Section 409A with respect to any Participant who also participates (or participated) in the Change in Control Plan, the Company may require that any amount payable under this Plan be paid at the time and in the form applicable for payments of a similar type (even if in a different amount) under the Change in Control Plan.













	20

















	(f)    


	No Warranty or Guaranty of Tax Treatment


	. Although the Company will use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation, interest and penalties under Section 409A, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under this Plan is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Company, its Affiliates nor their respective directors, officers, employees or advisers shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by a Participant (or any other individual claiming a benefit through the Participant) as a result of this Plan.

	EXHIBIT C





	RELEASE OF CLAIMS




	My employment with Teradata Corporation (“


	Teradata


	”) terminated effective as of [●], 20[●]. In exchange for the severance benefits provided under Section 4(b) of the Teradata Executive Severance Plan (the “

	”), which shall be provided upon the terms, and subject to the conditions of the Plan, including, but not limited to, my compliance with Section 7 of the Plan, I acknowledge and agree to the following:


















	1.






	I may sign and submit this Release of Claims (“


	Release


	”) at any time during the [21] [45] days after my termination.





















	2.






	I understand this Release does not constitute an admission by Teradata of any liability, violation of any federal or state laws, or any other civil wrong.





















	3.






	I may revoke this Release during the seven days after I sign it by delivering written notice to Teradata in accordance with Section 15 of the Plan no later than the close of business on the seventh day after signature. This Release will not become effective or enforceable until the expiration of that seven-day period. I understand that my severance benefits will be processed after the expiration of the seven-day period.





















	4.






	I release and discharge Teradata, its affiliates, successors, and each of their fiduciaries, stockholders, directors, officers, agents, and employees (“


	Released Parties


	”), from all claims, causes of action, suits, damages, rights to monetary or equitable relief, known or unknown, including access to Teradata’s internal dispute resolution process, for anything occurring up to and including the date on which I sign this Release. Without limiting the prior sentence, this release covers all claims I have, have ever had, or may now have, for or related in any way to my employment or the end of my employment with the Company, including but not limited to all claims for age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Family and Medical Leave Act; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“

	Without limiting the foregoing Paragraph, I represent that I understand that this Release specifically releases and waives any claims of age discrimination, known or unknown, that I may have against the Released Parties as of the date I sign this Release. This Release specifically includes a waiver of rights and claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended


	,


	and the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act. I acknowledge that as of the date I sign this Release, I may have certain rights or claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §626 and I voluntarily relinquish any such rights or claims by signing this Release.























	5.






	Teradata advises me to consult with an attorney prior to signing this Release. By signing this Release I understand I am giving up and waiving legal rights. I have either freely chosen not to consult with an attorney or I have decided to sign after discussing this Release with my attorney.





















	6.






	This Release does not prevent me from responding accurately and fully to any question, inquiry or request for information when required by legal process, or disclosing information to regulatory bodies. Further, nothing contained in this Release limits my ability to file a charge or complaint with any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “


	Government Agency


	”). In addition, nothing in this Release or any other Company agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit me from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any Government Agency or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. I understand that I do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures, and that I am not required to notify the Company that I have made such reports or disclosures. However, if I file any charge or complaint with any Government Agency, and if the Government Agency pursues any claim on my behalf, or if any other third party pursues any claim on my behalf, I hereby waive any right to monetary or other individualized relief (either individually, or as part of any collective or class action) that arises out of alleged facts or circumstances on or before the effective date of this Release; provided that nothing in this Release limits any right I may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission or other Government Agency.

	     Exhibit 10.10.23








	Form of Stock Option Agreement




	Under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan




	(Non-Statutory Stock Option)




	You have been granted an option (the “Option”) under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) to purchase a number of shares of common stock of Teradata Corporation (“Shares”) at the price per Share as described on the stock option information page on the website of Teradata’s third party Plan administrator, subject to the terms and conditions of this Stock Option Agreement (this “Agreement”) and the Plan. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.




	1. Your right to exercise this Option will expire on the tenth (10th) anniversary (the “Expiration Date”) of the date of grant of this Option (the “Date of Grant”), unless sooner terminated due to the termination of your employment as described below. If the Expiration Date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, it will be deemed to occur on the next following business day.




	2. This Option will vest, and the vested Shares (“Option Shares”) may be exercised, in equal annual installments (subject to mathematical rounding performed by Teradata’s third party Plan administrator) over the four year period commencing on the Date of Grant, such that all of the shares represented by this Option shall be vested on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Date of Grant. This vesting schedule is contingent upon your continuous employment with Teradata Corporation or any of its affiliate companies (collectively referred to in this Agreement as “Teradata”) as of and until each of the vesting dates. In the event your employment with Teradata terminates prior to the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Date of Grant, except as otherwise provided below, this Option will terminate with respect to the then unvested portions.




	3. This Option will vest in full if you (a) die while actively employed by Teradata, or (b) cease to be actively employed by Teradata as a result of a disability for which you qualify for benefits from the Teradata Long-Term Disability Plan or another long-term disability plan sponsored by Teradata (“Disability”). In such cases, this Option may be exercised until the later of (x) the third (3



	rd



	) anniversary of the date of death or Disability, or (y) the Expiration Date.




	4. If your employment with Teradata terminates in connection with your Retirement (as defined in this Section 4), and not due to your death or Disability, the unvested portion of this Option will terminate and be forfeited, and the vested portion may be exercised until the earlier of (a) the third (3



	rd



	) anniversary of your Retirement, or (b) the Expiration Date. For purposes of this Agreement, “Retirement” means termination of your employment at or after age 55 other than (i) as a result of your death or Disability, (ii) for Cause, or (iii) following a Change in Control, without Cause or, if applicable to you, for Good Reason (as described below).




	5. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event a Change in Control occurs and this Option award is not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, the Option shall vest immediately prior to the Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control wherein this Option award is assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, if Teradata terminates your employment other than for Cause or Disability during the twenty-four (24) months following the Change in Control, this Option shall vest in full immediately upon your termination of employment, and the Option shall remain exercisable until the later of (a) the earlier of the one (1) year anniversary of your termination of employment or the Expiration Date, or (b) the applicable date determined under Sections 3 and 4 above. If you are a participant in the Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan, a Teradata Severance Policy or a similar arrangement that defines “Good Reason” in the context of a resignation following a Change in Control and you terminate your employment for Good Reason as so defined within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control, this Option shall vest immediately upon your termination of employment, and the








	1








	     Exhibit 10.10.23








	Option Shares shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (a) the Expiration Date, or (b) the first (1st) anniversary of your termination of employment.




	6. If your Teradata employment is involuntarily terminated for Cause at any time, this Option will automatically terminate and all unexercised vested and unvested Option Shares will be forfeited and will not be exercisable as of the date of such termination. Further, if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause, then, to the extent demanded by the Committee in its sole discretion and permitted by applicable law, you shall (a) return to Teradata all Option Shares that you have not disposed of that have been acquired pursuant to this Agreement, in exchange for payment by Teradata of any amount actually paid by you for the Option Shares; and (b) with respect to any Option Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement that you have disposed of, pay to Teradata in cash the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of such Option Shares on the date acquired, over (ii) any amount actually paid by you for the Option Shares.




	7. In the event of a termination of your employment with Teradata for any other reason, including but not limited to reduction-in-force, this Option will automatically terminate, any unvested Option Shares will be forfeited and the vested portion of this Option may be exercised no later than the earlier of (a) the 59th day after the date of termination of your employment, or (b) the Expiration Date.




	8. In the event that you die after your termination of employment by Teradata, but while this Option remains exercisable, this Option may be exercised, by your beneficiary or heir, until the one (1) year anniversary of the date of your death, regardless of the Expiration Date.




	9. By accepting this award, except to the extent that disclosure is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, you agree to keep this Agreement confidential and not to disclose its contents to anyone except your attorney, your immediate family, or your financial consultant, provided such persons agree in advance to keep such information confidential and not to disclose it to others. The Option will be forfeited if you violate the terms of this Section 9. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Teradata agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit you from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”) or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. You do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify Teradata that you have made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right you may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency.




	10. This Option will be cancelled if the Committee determines that you engaged in misconduct in connection with your employment with Teradata.




	11. This Option shall be exercised in accordance with procedures established by the administrator of Teradata’s stock option program, including broker-assisted cashless exercises. In countries where deemed mandatory, upon exercise, the purchase price will be paid by simultaneous sale of the Option Shares exercised, in such a manner that Teradata is not subject to taxation upon grant of the option award. Any taxes required by law to be withheld or paid with respect to exercise of this Option shall be deducted from the proceeds of the Option exercise. If Teradata or the administrator of the stock option program is unable to withhold required taxes from the proceeds of the Option exercise, you or your legal representative or beneficiary will be required to pay such amounts, and Teradata may take any action necessary to satisfy such obligation, including but not limited to withholding cash from compensation otherwise due to you or your beneficiary, or withholding from the Option Shares exercised such numbers of Option Shares as it, in its sole discretion, shall determine to be required to satisfy such withholding requirements.








	2








	     Exhibit 10.10.23








	12. Within a reasonable period after any vested portion of this Option is exercised, Teradata will instruct its transfer agent and/or third party Plan administrator to credit you or your successor with the number of Option Shares you exercised. Neither you nor your legal representative shall be, or have any of the rights and privileges of, a stockholder of Teradata in respect of any Shares purchasable upon the exercise of this Option, in whole or in part, unless and until Teradata credits you with, or causes a credit to you of, such Option Shares.




	13. This Option is not transferable by you other than by beneficiary designation, will or the laws of descent and distribution, and during your lifetime this Option may be exercised only by you or your guardian or legal representative.




	14. You may designate one or more beneficiaries to receive all or part of this Option in case of your death, and you may change or revoke such designation at any time. In the event of your death, any portion of this Option that is subject to such a designation will be distributed to such beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with this Agreement. Any other portion of this Option not designated by you shall be distributable to your estate. If there is any question as to the legal right of any beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder, the Option Shares in question may be purchased by and distributed to your estate, in which event Teradata shall have no further liability to anyone with respect to such Option Shares.




	15. As a recipient of this equity award, you recognize that you have access to highly confidential, proprietary and non-public information of Teradata and its customers, including strategic plans, customer lists, research and development plans, and other information not made available to the general public and from which Teradata derives value. For purposes of this Agreement, this information is defined as “Trade Secret Information.”




	To protect Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information, and in exchange for this Option, you agree that the following restrictions will apply during your employment with Teradata and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, for a period of twelve (12) months after the date that you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason (the “Termination Date”) (or if applicable law mandates a maximum time that is shorter than twelve months, then for a period of time equal to that shorter maximum period):




	(a) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, render services directly or indirectly to, or become employed by, any Competing Organization of Teradata (as defined in this Section 15 below) to the extent such services or employment involves the development, manufacture, marketing, sale, advertising or servicing of any product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to, or competes with, a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, marketed, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and upon which you worked or in which you participated during the last twelve (12) months of your Teradata employment. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of and Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information to which you had access as an employee of Teradata).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 15(a) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.




	(b) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, directly or indirectly recruit, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any exempt employee of Teradata to terminate his or her employment with or otherwise cease his or her relationship with Teradata. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the information you obtained while a Teradata employee regarding the skills, experience and knowledge of Teradata employees, which is Trade Secret Information, and Teradata’s investment in developing these employees).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 15(b) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.








	3








	     Exhibit 10.10.23













	(c) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, solicit the business of any firm or company with which you worked during the preceding twelve (12) months of employment at Teradata, if such firm or company was a customer of Teradata, by using Teradata Trade Secret Information. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the identity of Teradata customers, their needs, interests, strategic plans, etc., all of which is Trade Secret Information you acquired as a Teradata employee with access to such information).









	If you breach the terms of this Section 15, you agree that in addition to any liability you may have for damages arising from such breach, any unvested Option Shares will be immediately forfeited, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay to Teradata the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value of any Option Shares that you acquired pursuant to the Option during the twelve (12) months prior to the Termination Date, over (y) the purchase price you paid to exercise the Option with respect to such Option Shares. The Fair Market Value of the Option Shares acquired shall be determined as of the applicable exercise date of the Option.









	As used in this Section 15, “Competing Organization” means a person or organization which is engaged in or about to become engaged in research on or development, production, marketing, leasing, selling or servicing of a product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and is therefore a competitor of Teradata. This includes but is not limited to persons or organizations identified as a “Competing Organization” in a list prepared by the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata for the year in which your employment with Teradata terminates. This list is maintained by the Teradata Law Department.




	16. By accepting this Option, you agree that, where permitted by local law, any controversy or claim arising out of or related to your employment relationship with Teradata shall be resolved by first exhausting any Teradata internal dispute resolution process and policy, and then by arbitration pursuant to such policy. If you are employed in the United States, the arbitration shall be pursuant to the Teradata dispute resolution policy and the then current rules of the American Arbitration Association and shall be held in the city of the location of the headquarters of Teradata. If you are employed outside the United States, where permitted by local law, the arbitration shall be conducted in the regional headquarters city of the business unit in which you work. The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator who is an attorney knowledgeable in employment law. The arbitrator’s decision and award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. For arbitrations held in the United States, issues of arbitrability shall be determined in accordance with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; all other aspects shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state in which the headquarters of Teradata is located. Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees associated with the arbitration and other costs and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne as provided by the rules of the American Arbitration Association for an arbitration held in the United States, or similar applicable rules for an arbitration held outside the United States.




	Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, you acknowledge that if you breach Section 15, Teradata will sustain irreparable injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law. As a result, you agree that in the event of your breach of Section 15 Teradata may, in addition to any other remedies available to it, bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable relief to preserve the status quo pending appointment of an arbitrator and completion of an arbitration. You stipulate to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in the location from which Teradata’s Option program is administered for any such proceedings.




	17. By accepting this award, you acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, you may be required to forfeit or repay any or all of the Option Shares pursuant








	4








	     Exhibit 10.10.23








	to the terms of the Teradata Corporation Compensation Recovery Policy (or a successor policy), as the same may be amended to comply with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or any rules or regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission rule or applicable securities exchange.




	18. The provisions of this Agreement are severable. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction (including an arbitration tribunal), it shall be severed and shall not affect any other part of this Agreement, which will be enforced as permitted by law.




	19. The terms of this Option as evidenced by this Agreement may be amended by the Teradata Board of Directors or the Committee at any time.




	20. This Option and the number and kind of Shares covered by this Agreement shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15 of the Plan.




	21. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon you any right with respect to continuance of employment by Teradata, nor limit or affect in any manner the right of Teradata to terminate your employment or adjust your compensation.




	22. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Plan, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail, except that with respect to matters involving choice of law the terms and conditions of Section 16 of this Agreement shall prevail.




	23. By accepting any benefit under this Agreement, you and each person claiming under or through you shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated their acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan and any action taken under this Agreement or the Plan by the Committee, the Board of Directors or Teradata, in any case in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.




	24. Teradata may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Teradata or a third party designated by Teradata.

	This Option will vest, and the vested Shares (“Option Shares”) may be exercised, in equal annual installments (subject to mathematical rounding performed by Teradata’s third party Plan administrator) over the four year period commencing on the Date of Grant, such that all of the shares represented by this Option shall be vested on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Date of Grant. This vesting schedule is contingent upon your continuous employment with Teradata Corporation or any of its affiliate companies (collectively referred to in this Agreement as “Teradata”) as of and until each of the vesting dates. In the event your employment with Teradata terminates prior to the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Date of Grant, except as otherwise provided below, this Option will terminate with respect to the then unvested portions.









	3.


	This Option will vest in full if you (a) die while actively employed by Teradata or (b) cease to be actively employed by Teradata as a result of a disability for which you qualify for benefits from the Teradata Long-Term Disability Plan or another long-term disability plan sponsored by Teradata (“Disability”). In such cases, this Option may be exercised until the later of (x) the third (3



	rd



	) anniversary of the date of death or Disability, or (y) the Expiration Date.









	4.


	If your employment with Teradata terminates in connection with your Retirement (as defined in this Section 4), and not due to your death or Disability, the unvested portion of this Option will terminate and be forfeited, and the vested portion may be exercised until the earlier of (a) the third (3rd) anniversary of your Retirement, or (b) the Expiration Date. For purposes of this Agreement, “Retirement” means termination of your employment (other than (i) as a result of your death or Disability, (ii) for Cause, or (iii) following a Change in Control, without Cause or, if applicable to you, for Good Reason (as described below)) at or after age 55 with the consent of the Compensation & Human Resource Committee of the Teradata Board of Directors (the “Committee”), unless otherwise provided for by mandatory local law provisions.









	5.


	Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event a Change in Control occurs and this Option award is not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, the Option shall vest immediately prior to the Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control wherein this Option award is assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, if Teradata terminates your employment other than for Cause or Disability during the twenty-four (24) months following the Change in Control, this Option shall vest in full immediately upon your termination of employment, and the Option shall remain exercisable until the later of (a) the earlier of the one (1) year anniversary of your termination of employment or the Expiration Date, or (b) the applicable date determined under Sections 3 and 4 above. If you are a








	1













	Exhibit 10.10.24








	participant in the Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan, a Teradata Severance Policy or a similar arrangement that defines “Good Reason” in the context of a resignation following a Change in Control and you terminate your employment for Good Reason as so defined within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control, this Option shall vest immediately upon your termination of employment, and the Option Shares shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (a) the Expiration Date, or (b) the first anniversary of your termination of employment.









	6.


	If your Teradata employment is involuntarily terminated for Cause at any time, this Option will automatically terminate and all unexercised vested and unvested Option Shares will be forfeited and will not be exercisable as of the date of such termination. Further, if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause, then, to the extent demanded by the Committee in its sole discretion and permitted by applicable law, you shall (a) return to Teradata all Option Shares that you have not disposed of that have been acquired pursuant to this Agreement, in exchange for payment by Teradata of any amount actually paid by you for the Option Shares; and (b) with respect to any Option Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement that you have disposed of, pay to Teradata in cash the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of such Option Shares on the date acquired, over (ii) any amount actually paid by you for the Option Shares.









	7.


	 In the event of a termination of your employment with Teradata for any other reason, including but not limited to reduction-in-force, this Option will automatically terminate, any unvested Options will be forfeited and the vested portion of this Option may be exercised no later than the earlier of (a) the 59th day after the date of termination of your employment or (b) the Expiration Date.









	8.


	In the event that you die after your termination of employment by Teradata, but while this Option remains exercisable, this Option may be exercised, by your heirs or your estate, until the one (1) year anniversary of the date of your death, regardless of the Expiration Date.









	9.


	By accepting this award, except to the extent that disclosure is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, you agree to keep this Agreement confidential and not to disclose its contents to anyone except your attorney, your immediate family, or your financial consultant provided such persons agree in advance to keep such information confidential and not to disclose it to others. The Option will be forfeited if you violate the terms of this Section 9. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Teradata agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit you from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”) or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. You do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify Teradata that you have made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right you may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency.









	10.


	This Option will be cancelled if the Committee determines that you engaged in misconduct in connection with your employment with Teradata.









	11.


	This Option shall be exercised in accordance with procedures established by the administrator of Teradata’s stock option program, including broker-assisted cashless exercises.







	12.


	Regardless of any action Teradata or your employer who is a Teradata affiliate (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all income tax or withholdings, payroll tax, payment on account, social contributions, required deductions, other payments, or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by Teradata or the Employer to be an appropriate charge








	2













	Exhibit 10.10.24








	to you even if technically due by Teradata or the Employer (“Tax-Related Items”), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Teradata or the Employer. You also agree that you solely are responsible for filing all relevant documentation that may be required of you in relation to this Option or any Tax-Related Items, such as but not limited to personal income tax returns or reporting statements in relation to the grant, vesting or exercise of this Option, the holding of Shares or any bank or brokerage account, or the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends. You further acknowledge that Teradata and/or the Employer: (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option grant, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (b) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate your liability for such Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. You also understand applicable laws may require varying Share or Option valuation methods for purposes of calculating Tax-Related Items, and Teradata assumes no responsibility or liability in relation to any such valuation or for any calculation or reporting of income or Tax-Related Items that may be required of you under applicable law. Further, if you have become subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Teradata and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.









	Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to Teradata or the Employer, to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Teradata and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as Teradata may specify from time to time, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:









	(a)


	    


	withholding from any wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Teradata and/or the Employer;









	(b)


	    


	withholding otherwise deliverable Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option; or









	(c)


	    


	withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by Teradata (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization).









	To avoid negative accounting treatment, Teradata may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum and maximum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the exercised Option, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. You shall pay to Teradata and/or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Teradata and/or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. Teradata may refuse to honor the exercise and/or deliver to you any Shares pursuant to your Option if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section 12.









	13.


	Within a reasonable period after any vested portion of this Option is exercised, Teradata will instruct its transfer agent and/or third party Plan administrator to credit you or your successor with the number of Option Shares you exercised. Neither you nor your legal representative shall be, or have any of the rights and privileges of, a stockholder of Teradata in respect of any Shares purchasable upon the exercise of this








	3













	Exhibit 10.10.24








	Option, in whole or in part, unless and until Teradata credits you with, or causes a credit to you of, such Option Shares.









	14.


	You understand and agree that any cross-border cash remittance made to exercise this Option or transfer of proceeds received upon the sale of Shares must be made through a locally authorized financial institution or registered foreign exchange agency and may require you to provide to such financial institution or agency certain information regarding the transaction. Moreover, you understand and agree that Teradata is neither responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar (US $) (or the selection by Teradata or the Employer in its sole discretion of an applicable foreign currency exchange rate) that may affect the value of this Option (or the calculation of income or any Tax-Related Items thereunder) nor liable for any decrease in the value of Shares or this Option. In addition, the ownership of Shares or assets and holding of a bank or brokerage account abroad may subject you to reporting requirements imposed by tax, banking, and/or other authorities in your country, and you understand and agree that you solely are responsible for complying with such requirements.









	15.


	This Option is not transferable by you other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and during your lifetime this Option may be exercised only by you or your guardian or legal representative.









	16.


	As a recipient of this equity award, you recognize that you have access to highly confidential, proprietary and non-public information of Teradata and its customers, including strategic plans, customer lists, research and development plans, and other information not made available to the general public and from which Teradata derives value. For purposes of this Agreement, this information is defined as “Trade Secret Information.”




	To protect Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information, and in exchange for the Option Shares, you agree that the following restrictions will apply during your employment with Teradata and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, for a period of twelve (12) months after the date that you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason (the “Termination Date”) (or if applicable law mandates a maximum time that is shorter than twelve months, then for a period of time equal to that shorter maximum period):




	(a) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, render services directly or indirectly to, or become employed by, any Competing Organization of Teradata (as defined in this Section 16 below) to the extent such services or employment involves the development, manufacture, marketing, sale, advertising or servicing of any product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to, or competes with, a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, marketed, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and upon which you worked or in which you participated during the last twelve (12) months of your Teradata employment. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of and Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information to which you had access as an employee of Teradata).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 16(a) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.




	(b) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, directly or indirectly recruit, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any exempt employee of Teradata to terminate his or her employment with or otherwise cease his or her relationship with Teradata. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the information you obtained while a Teradata employee regarding the skills, experience and knowledge of Teradata employees, which is Trade Secret Information, and Teradata’s investment in developing these employees).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 16(b) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.








	4













	Exhibit 10.10.24













	(c) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, solicit the business of any firm or company with which you worked during the preceding twelve (12) months of employment at Teradata, if such firm or company was a customer of Teradata, by using Teradata Trade Secret Information. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the identity of Teradata customers, their needs, interests, strategic plans, etc., all of which is Trade Secret Information you acquired as a Teradata employee with access to such information).









	If you breach the terms of this Section 16, you agree that in addition to any liability you may have for damages arising from such breach, any unvested Option Shares will be immediately forfeited, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay to Teradata the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value of any Option Shares that you acquired pursuant to the Option during the twelve (12) months prior to the Termination Date, over (y) the purchase price you paid to exercise the Option with respect to such Option Shares. The Fair Market Value of the Option Shares acquired shall be determined as of the applicable exercise date of the Option.









	As used in this Section 16, “Competing Organization” means a person or organization which is engaged in or about to become engaged in research on or development, production, marketing, leasing, selling or servicing of a product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and is therefore a competitor of Teradata. This includes but is not limited to persons or organizations identified as a “Competing Organization” in a list prepared by the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata for the year in which your employment with Teradata terminates. This list is maintained by the Teradata Law Department.

	Exhibit 10.10.25








	Form of Restricted Share Unit Agreement




	Under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan









	You have been awarded a number of restricted Share Units (the “Share Units”) under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), as described on the restricted share unit information page on the website of Teradata’s third party Plan administrator, subject to the terms and conditions of this Restricted Share Unit Agreement (this “Agreement”) and the Plan. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.




	 




	1. One-third of the Share Units will become non-forfeitable (“Vested”) on each of the first three anniversaries of the Date of Grant (each such anniversary a “Vesting Date”), subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by the third party Plan administrator, and provided that you are continuously employed by Teradata or any of its affiliate companies (referred to collectively herein as “Teradata”) until each such Vesting Date.




	2. If your employment with Teradata terminates prior to a Vesting Date due to (i) your death, or (ii) a disability for which you qualify for benefits under the Teradata Long-Term Disability Plan or another long-term disability plan sponsored by Teradata (“Disability”), then, upon such termination of employment, the remaining unvested Share Units will become fully Vested. If your employment with Teradata terminates prior to a Vesting Date due to your Retirement then, upon such termination of employment, a pro rata portion of the Share Units will become fully Vested. For purposes of this Agreement, “Retirement” means termination by you of your employment with Teradata (other than, if applicable to you, for Good Reason (as described below) following a Change in Control) at or after age 55 with the consent of the Compensation & Human Resource Committee of the Teradata Board of Directors (the “Committee”). The pro rata portion of the Share Units that will become fully Vested upon Retirement will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of unvested Share Units that would have Vested on the next Vesting Date had you remained employed with Teradata by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months of employment you completed commencing with the Vesting Date that occurred immediately prior to your termination (or, if none, commencing on the date of grant of this award (“Date of Grant”)), and the denominator of which is twelve (12) months (subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by the third party Plan administrator). For purposes of determining any pro rata Vesting of your Share Units, your period of employment with Teradata shall not include any leave of absence, other than an approved leave of absence from which Teradata reasonably expects that you will return to perform services for Teradata.









	Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event a Change in Control occurs and this restricted Share Unit award is not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, the remaining unvested Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately prior to the Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control wherein this restricted Share Unit award is assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, if your employment is terminated by Teradata other than for Cause or Disability during the twenty-four (24) months following the Change in Control, the remaining unvested Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately upon your termination of employment. If you are a participant in the Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan, a Teradata Severance Policy or a similar arrangement that defines “Good Reason” in the context of a resignation following a Change in Control and you terminate your employment for Good Reason as so defined within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control, the remaining unvested Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately upon your termination of employment.













	1








	Exhibit 10.10.25








	To the extent that the Share Units have not yet vested pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 above, they shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice, if you cease to be employed by Teradata prior to an applicable Vesting Date other than as provided in this Section 2.









	3. Except as may be otherwise provided in this Section 3, when Vested, the Share Units will be paid to you within 30 days after each applicable Vesting Date in Shares (such that one Share Unit equals one Share).









	To the extent that the Share Units become Vested pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement and your right to receive payment of Vested Share Units constitutes a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then payment of such Share Units shall be subject to the following rules: (i) the Share Units will be paid to you within 30 days after the earlier of (a) your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, or (b) the applicable Vesting Date; (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Share Units become payable as a result of your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (other than as a result of death), and you are a “specified employee” as determined under Teradata's policy for determining specified employees on the date of separation from service, the Share Units shall be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; and (iii) Teradata may, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), terminate this Agreement and pay all outstanding Share Units to you within 30 days before or 12 months after a “change in the ownership,” a “change in the effective control” or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets” of Teradata within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.









	4. By accepting this award, unless disclosure is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, you agree to keep this Agreement confidential and not to disclose its contents to anyone except your attorney, your immediate family, or your financial consultant, provided such persons agree in advance to keep such information confidential and not disclose it to others. The Share Units will be forfeited if you violate the terms and conditions of this Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Teradata agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit you from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”) or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. You do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify Teradata that you have made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right you may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency.









	5. The Share Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated, except by beneficiary designation, will or by the laws of descent and distribution upon your death. As soon as practicable after a Vesting Date, Teradata will instruct its Transfer Agent and/or its third party Plan administrator to record on your account the number of Shares underlying the number of Share Units to be paid to you in Shares and such Shares will be freely transferable.









	6. Any cash dividends declared before an applicable Vesting Date on the Shares underlying the Share Units shall not be paid currently, but shall be converted into additional Share Units. Any Share Units resulting from such conversion (the “Dividend Units”) will be considered Share Units for purposes of this Agreement and will be subject to all of the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth herein. As of each date that Teradata would otherwise pay the declared dividend on the Shares underlying the Share Units (the “Dividend Payment Date”) in the absence of the reinvestment requirements of this Section 6, the number of Dividend Units will be determined by dividing the amount of dividends otherwise attributable to the Share Units but not paid on

	Exhibit 10.10.25








	the Dividend Payment Date by the Fair Market Value of Teradata’s common stock on the Dividend Payment Date.









	7. Teradata has the right to deduct or cause to be deducted from, or collect or cause to be collected, with respect to the taxation of any Share Units, any federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes required by the laws of the United States or any other country to be withheld or paid with respect to the Share Units, and you or your legal representative or beneficiary will be required to pay any such amounts. By accepting this award, you consent and direct that, if you are paid through Teradata’s United States payroll system at the time the Share Units Vest, Teradata’s stock plan administrator may withhold or sell the number of Share Units from your award as Teradata, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to satisfy such withholding requirements. If you are paid through a non-United States Teradata payroll system, you agree that Teradata may satisfy any withholding obligations by withholding cash from your compensation otherwise due to you or by any other action as it may deem necessary to satisfy any withholding obligation.









	8. The Share Units will be forfeited if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause or if the Committee determines that you engaged in misconduct in connection with your employment with Teradata. Further, if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause, then, to the extent demanded by the Committee in its sole discretion and permitted by applicable law, you shall (a) return to Teradata all Shares that you have not disposed of that have been acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of your termination of employment, and (b) with respect to any Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of your termination of employment and that you have disposed of, pay to Teradata in cash the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date acquired.




	  




	9. As a recipient of this equity award, you recognize that you have access to highly confidential, proprietary and non-public information of Teradata and its customers, including strategic plans, customer lists, research and development plans, and other information not made available to the general public and from which Teradata derives value. For purposes of this Agreement, this information is defined as “Trade Secret Information.”









	To protect Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information, and in exchange for the Share Units, you agree that the following restrictions will apply during your employment with Teradata and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, for a period of twelve (12) months after the date that you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason (the “Termination Date”) (or if applicable law mandates a maximum time that is shorter than twelve months, then for a period of time equal to that shorter maximum period):









	(a) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, render services directly or indirectly to, or become employed by, any Competing Organization of Teradata (as defined in this Section 9 below) to the extent such services or employment involves the development, manufacture, marketing, sale, advertising or servicing of any product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to, or competes with, a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, marketed, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and upon which you worked or in which you participated during the last twelve (12) months of your Teradata employment. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of and Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information to which you had access as an employee of Teradata).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9(a) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.













	3








	Exhibit 10.10.25








	(b) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, directly or indirectly recruit, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any exempt employee of Teradata to terminate his or her employment with or otherwise cease his or her relationship with Teradata. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the information you obtained while a Teradata employee regarding the skills, experience and knowledge of Teradata employees, which is Trade Secret Information, and Teradata’s investment in developing these employees).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9(b) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.









	(c) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, solicit the business of any firm or company with which you worked during the preceding twelve (12) months of employment at Teradata, if such firm or company was a customer of Teradata, by using Teradata Trade Secret Information. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the identity of Teradata customers, their needs, interests, strategic plans, etc., all of which is Trade Secret Information you acquired as a Teradata employee with access to such information).









	If you breach the terms of this Section 9, you agree that in addition to any liability you may have for damages arising from such breach, any unvested Share Units will be immediately forfeited, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay to Teradata the Fair Market Value of any Share Units that Vested during the twelve (12) months prior to the Termination Date. Such Fair Market Value shall be determined as of each applicable Vesting Date.









	As used in this Section 9, “Competing Organization” means a person or organization which is engaged in or about to become engaged in research on or development, production, marketing, leasing, selling or servicing of a product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and is therefore a competitor of Teradata. This includes but is not limited to persons or organizations identified as a “Competing Organization” in a list prepared by the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata for the year in which your employment with Teradata terminates. This list is maintained by the Teradata Law Department.




	10. By accepting this award, you agree that, where permitted by local law, any controversy or claim arising out of or related to your employment relationship with Teradata shall be resolved by first exhausting any Teradata internal dispute resolution process and policy, and then by arbitration pursuant to such policy. If you are employed in the United States, the arbitration shall be pursuant to the Teradata dispute resolution policy and the then current rules of the American Arbitration Association and shall be held in the city of the location of the headquarters of Teradata. If you are employed outside the United States, where permitted by local law, the arbitration shall be conducted in the regional headquarters city of the business unit in which you work. The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator who is an attorney knowledgeable in employment law. The arbitrator’s decision and award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. For arbitrations held in the United States, issues of arbitrability shall be determined in accordance with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; all other aspects shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state in which the headquarters of Teradata is located. Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees associated with the arbitration, and other costs and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne as provided by the rules of the American Arbitration Association for an arbitration held in the United States, or similar applicable rules for an arbitration held outside the United States.




	Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, you acknowledge that if you breach Section 9, Teradata will sustain irreparable injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law. As a result, you agree that in the event of your breach of Section 9 Teradata may, in addition to any other remedies available to it, bring an








	4








	Exhibit 10.10.25








	action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable relief to preserve the status quo pending appointment of an arbitrator and completion of an arbitration. You stipulate to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in the location from which Teradata’s equity program is administered, for any such proceedings.




	11. You may designate one or more beneficiaries to receive all or part of any Share Units to be distributed in case of your death, and you may change or revoke such designation at any time. In the event of your death, any Share Units distributable hereunder that are subject to such a designation will be distributed to such beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with this Agreement. Any other Share Units not designated by you will be distributable to your estate. If there is any question as to the legal right of any beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder, the Share Units in question may be transferred to your estate, in which event Teradata will have no further liability to anyone with respect to such Share Units.




	12. The provisions of this Agreement are severable. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction (including an arbitration tribunal), it shall be severed and shall not affect any other part of this Agreement, which will be enforced as permitted by law.




	13. The terms of this award of Share Units as evidenced by this Agreement may be amended by the Teradata Board of Directors or the Committee.




	14. The number of Share Units and the number and kind of Shares covered by this Agreement shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15 of the Plan.




	15. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Plan, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail, except that with respect to matters involving choice of law the terms and conditions of Section 10 of this Agreement shall prevail.




	16. You shall not possess any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in the Shares underlying the Share Units until such Shares have been delivered to you in accordance with this Agreement. The obligations of Teradata under this Agreement will be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of Teradata to deliver Shares in the future following Vesting of the Share Units, and your rights will be no greater than those of an unsecured general creditor. No assets of Teradata will be held or set aside as security for the obligations of Teradata under this Agreement.




	17. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon you any right with respect to continuance of employment by Teradata, nor limit or affect in any manner the right of Teradata to terminate your employment or adjust your compensation.




	18. By accepting any benefit under this Agreement, you and each person claiming under or through you shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated their acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan and any action taken under this Agreement or the Plan by the Committee, the Board of Directors or Teradata, in any case in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.




	19. Teradata may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by Teradata or a third party designated by Teradata.

	Exhibit 10.10.25













	Form of Restricted Share Unit Agreement




	Under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan









	You have been awarded a number of restricted Share Units (the “Share Units”) under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), as described on the restricted share unit information page on the website of Teradata’s third party Plan administrator, subject to the terms and conditions of this Restricted Share Unit Agreement (this “Agreement”) and the Plan. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.




	 




	1. The Share Units will become non-forfeitable (“Vested”) on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant (the “Vesting Date”), provided that you are continuously employed by Teradata or any of its affiliate companies (referred to collectively herein as “Teradata”) until the Vesting Date.




	2. If your employment with Teradata terminates prior to the Vesting Date due to (i) your death, or (ii) a disability for which you qualify for benefits under the Teradata Long-Term Disability Plan or another long-term disability plan sponsored by Teradata (“Disability”), then, upon such termination of employment, your Share Units will become fully Vested. If your employment with Teradata terminates prior to the Vesting Date due to (a) your Retirement, or (b) a reduction-in-force, then, upon such termination of employment, a pro rata portion of the Share Units will become fully Vested. For purposes of this Agreement, “Retirement” means termination by you of your employment with Teradata (other than, if applicable to you, for Good Reason (as described below) following a Change in Control) at or after age 55 with the consent of the Compensation & Human Resource Committee of the Teradata Board of Directors (the “Committee”). The pro rata portion of the Share Units that will become fully Vested in accordance with the preceding sentence will be determined by multiplying the total number of the Share Units awarded pursuant to this Agreement by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months of employment that you completed after the date of grant of this award (the “Date of Grant”), and the denominator of which is the total number of months during the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the Vesting Date (subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by the third party Plan administrator). For purposes of determining any pro rata Vesting of your Share Units, your period of employment with Teradata shall not include any leave of absence, other than an approved leave of absence from which Teradata reasonably expects that you will return to perform services for Teradata.









	Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event a Change in Control occurs and this restricted Share Unit award is not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, the Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately prior to the Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control wherein this restricted Share Unit award is assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, if your employment is terminated by Teradata other than for Cause or Disability during the twenty-four (24) months following the Change in Control, the Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately upon your termination of employment. If you are a participant in the Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan, a Teradata Severance Policy or a similar arrangement that defines “Good Reason” in the context of a resignation following a Change in Control and you terminate your employment for Good Reason as so defined within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control, the Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately upon your termination of employment.









	3. Except as may be otherwise provided in this Section 3, when Vested, the Share Units will be paid to you within 30 days after the Vesting Date in Shares (such that one Share Unit equals one Share).













	6








	Exhibit 10.10.25








	To the extent that the Share Units become Vested pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement and your right to receive payment of Vested Share Units constitutes a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then payment of such Share Units shall be subject to the following rules: (i) the Share Units will be paid to you within 30 days after the earlier of (a) your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, or (b) the Vesting Date; (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Share Units become payable as a result of your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (other than as a result of death), and you are a “specified employee” as determined under Teradata's policy for determining specified employees on the date of separation from service, the Share Units shall be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; and (iii) Teradata may, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), terminate this Agreement and pay all outstanding Share Units to you within 30 days before or 12 months after a “change in the ownership,” a “change in the effective control” or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets” of Teradata within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.









	4. By accepting this award, unless disclosure is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, you agree to keep this Agreement confidential and not to disclose its contents to anyone except your attorney, your immediate family, or your financial consultant, provided such persons agree in advance to keep such information confidential and not disclose it to others. The Share Units will be forfeited if you violate the terms and conditions of this Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Teradata agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit you from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”) or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. You do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify Teradata that you have made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right you may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency.









	5. The Share Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated, except by beneficiary designation, will or by the laws of descent and distribution upon your death. As soon as practicable after the Vesting Date, Teradata will instruct its Transfer Agent and/or its third party Plan administrator to record on your account the number of Shares underlying the number of Share Units to be paid to you in Shares and such Shares will be freely transferable.









	6. Any cash dividends declared before the Vesting Date on the Shares underlying the Share Units shall not be paid currently, but shall be converted into additional Share Units. Any Share Units resulting from such conversion (the “Dividend Units”) will be considered Share Units for purposes of this Agreement and will be subject to all of the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth herein. As of each date that Teradata would otherwise pay the declared dividend on the Shares underlying the Share Units (the “Dividend Payment Date”) in the absence of the reinvestment requirements of this Section 6, the number of Dividend Units will be determined by dividing the amount of dividends otherwise attributable to the Share Units but not paid on the Dividend Payment Date by the Fair Market Value of Teradata’s common stock on the Dividend Payment Date.









	7. Teradata has the right to deduct or cause to be deducted from, or collect or cause to be collected, with respect to the taxation of any Share Units, any federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes required by the laws of the United States or any other country to be withheld or paid with respect to the Share Units, and you or your legal representative or beneficiary will be required to pay any such amounts. By accepting this award, you consent and direct that, if you are paid through Teradata’s United States payroll system at the








	7








	Exhibit 10.10.25








	time the Share Units Vest, Teradata’s stock plan administrator may withhold or sell the number of Share Units from your award as Teradata, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to satisfy such withholding requirements. If you are paid through a non-United States Teradata payroll system, you agree that Teradata may satisfy any withholding obligations by withholding cash from your compensation otherwise due to you or by any other action as it may deem necessary to satisfy any withholding obligation.









	8. The Share Units will be forfeited if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause or if the Committee determines that you engaged in misconduct in connection with your employment with Teradata. Further, if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause, then, to the extent demanded by the Committee in its sole discretion and permitted by applicable law, you shall (a) return to Teradata all Shares that you have not disposed of that have been acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of your termination of employment, and (b) with respect to any Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of your termination of employment and that you have disposed of, pay to Teradata in cash the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date acquired.




	9. As a recipient of this equity award, you recognize that you have access to highly confidential, proprietary and non-public information of Teradata and its customers, including strategic plans, customer lists, research and development plans, and other information not made available to the general public and from which Teradata derives value. For purposes of this Agreement, this information is defined as “Trade Secret Information.”




	To protect Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information, and in exchange for the Share Units, you agree that the following restrictions will apply during your employment with Teradata and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, for a period of twelve (12) months after the date that you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason (the “Termination Date”) (or if applicable law mandates a maximum time that is shorter than twelve months, then for a period of time equal to that shorter maximum period):




	(a) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, render services directly or indirectly to, or become employed by, any Competing Organization of Teradata (as defined in this Section 9 below) to the extent such services or employment involves the development, manufacture, marketing, sale, advertising or servicing of any product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to, or competes with, a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, marketed, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and upon which you worked or in which you participated during the last twelve (12) months of your Teradata employment. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of and Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information to which you had access as an employee of Teradata).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9(a) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.




	(b) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, directly or indirectly recruit, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any exempt employee of Teradata to terminate his or her employment with or otherwise cease his or her relationship with Teradata. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the information you obtained while a Teradata employee regarding the skills, experience and knowledge of Teradata employees, which is Trade Secret Information, and Teradata’s investment in developing these employees).




	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9(b) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.

	(c) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, solicit the business of any firm or company with which you worked during the preceding twelve (12) months of employment at Teradata, if such firm or company was a customer of Teradata, by using Teradata Trade Secret Information. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the identity of Teradata customers, their needs, interests, strategic plans, etc., all of which is Trade Secret Information you acquired as a Teradata employee with access to such information).









	If you breach the terms of this Section 9, you agree that in addition to any liability you may have for damages arising from such breach, any unvested Share Units will be immediately forfeited, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay to Teradata the Fair Market Value of any Share Units that Vested during the twelve (12) months prior to the Termination Date. Such Fair Market Value shall be determined as of the Vesting Date.









	As used in this Section 9, “Competing Organization” means a person or organization which is engaged in or about to become engaged in research on or development, production, marketing, leasing, selling or servicing of a product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and is therefore a competitor of Teradata. This includes but is not limited to persons or organizations identified as a “Competing Organization” in a list prepared by the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata for the year in which your employment with Teradata terminates. This list is maintained by the Teradata Law Department.




	10. By accepting this award, you agree that, where permitted by local law, any controversy or claim arising out of or related to your employment relationship with Teradata shall be resolved by first exhausting any Teradata internal dispute resolution process and policy, and then by arbitration pursuant to such policy. If you are employed in the United States, the arbitration shall be pursuant to the Teradata dispute resolution policy and the then current rules of the American Arbitration Association and shall be held in the city of the location of the headquarters of Teradata. If you are employed outside the United States, where permitted by local law, the arbitration shall be conducted in the regional headquarters city of the business unit in which you work. The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator who is an attorney knowledgeable in employment law. The arbitrator’s decision and award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. For arbitrations held in the United States, issues of arbitrability shall be determined in accordance with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; all other aspects shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state in which the headquarters of Teradata is located. Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees associated with the arbitration, and other costs and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne as provided by the rules of the American Arbitration Association for an arbitration held in the United States, or similar applicable rules for an arbitration held outside the United States.




	Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, you acknowledge that if you breach Section 9, Teradata will sustain irreparable injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law. As a result, you agree that in the event of your breach of Section 9 Teradata may, in addition to any other remedies available to it, bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable relief to preserve the status quo pending appointment of an arbitrator and completion of an arbitration. You stipulate to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in the location from which Teradata’s equity program is administered, for any such proceedings.




	11. You may designate one or more beneficiaries to receive all or part of any Share Units to be distributed in case of your death, and you may change or revoke such designation at any time. In the event of your death, any Share Units distributable hereunder that are subject to such a designation will be distributed to such beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with this Agreement. Any other Share Units not designated by you will be distributable to your estate. If there is any question as to the legal right of any beneficiary to

	receive a distribution hereunder, the Share Units in question may be transferred to your estate, in which event Teradata will have no further liability to anyone with respect to such Share Units.




	12. The provisions of this Agreement are severable. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction (including an arbitration tribunal), it shall be severed and shall not affect any other part of this Agreement, which will be enforced as permitted by law.




	13. The terms of this award of Share Units as evidenced by this Agreement may be amended by the Teradata Board of Directors or the Committee.




	14. The number of Share Units and the number and kind of Shares covered by this Agreement shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 15 of the Plan.




	15. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Plan, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail, except that with respect to matters involving choice of law the terms and conditions of Section 10 of this Agreement shall prevail.




	16. You shall not possess any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in the Shares underlying the Share Units until such Shares have been delivered to you in accordance with this Agreement.

	Form of Restricted Share Unit Agreement




	For Non-U.S. Employees




	Under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan









	You have been awarded a number of restricted share units (the “Share Units”) under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), as described on the restricted share unit information page on the website of Teradata’s third party Plan administrator, subject to the terms and conditions of this Restricted Share Unit Agreement (this “Agreement”) and the Plan. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.




	 




	1.


	One-third of the Share Units will become non-forfeitable (“Vested”) on each of the first three anniversaries of the Date of Grant (each such anniversary a “Vesting Date”), subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by the third party Plan administrator, and provided that you are continuously and actively employed, as described in section 11(l) below, by Teradata or any of its affiliate companies (referred to collectively herein as “Teradata”) until each such Vesting Date.









	2.


	If your employment with Teradata terminates prior to a Vesting Date due to (i) your death, or (ii) a disability for which you qualify for benefits under the Teradata Long-Term Disability Plan or another long-term disability plan sponsored by Teradata (“Disability”), then, upon such termination of employment, the remaining unvested Share Units will become fully Vested. If your employment with Teradata terminates prior to a Vesting Date due to your Retirement then, upon such termination of employment, a pro rata portion of the Share Units will become fully Vested. For purposes of this Agreement, “Retirement” means termination by you of your employment with Teradata (other than, if applicable to you, for Good Reason (as described below) following a Change in Control) at or after age 55 with the consent of the Compensation & Human Resource Committee of the Teradata Board of Directors (the “Committee”), unless otherwise provided for by mandatory local law provisions. The pro rata portion of the Share Units that will become fully Vested upon Retirement will be determined by multiplying (x) the number of unvested Share Units that would have vested on the next Vesting Date had you remained employed with Teradata by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months of employment you completed commencing with the Vesting Date that occurred immediately prior to your termination (or, if none, commencing on the date of grant of this award (“Date of Grant”)), and the denominator of which is twelve (12) months (subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by the third party Plan administrator). For purposes of determining any pro rata Vesting of your Share Units, your period of employment with Teradata shall not include any leave of absence, other than an approved leave of absence from which Teradata reasonably expects that you will return to perform services for Teradata.




	Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event a Change in Control occurs and this restricted Share Unit award is not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, the remaining unvested Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately prior to the Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control wherein this restricted Share Unit award is assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, if your employment is terminated by Teradata other than for Cause or Disability during the twenty-four (24) months following the Change in Control, the remaining unvested Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately upon your termination of employment. If you are a participant in the Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan, a Teradata Severance Policy or a similar arrangement that defines “Good Reason” in the context of a resignation following a Change in Control and you terminate your employment for Good Reason as so defined within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control, the remaining unvested Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately upon your termination of employment.













	    








	Exhibit 10.10.26








	To the extent that the Share Units have not yet vested pursuant to Sections 1 and 2 above, they shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice, if you cease to be employed by Teradata prior to an applicable Vesting Date other than as provided in this Section 2.




	3.


	Except as may be otherwise provided in this Section 3, when Vested, the Share Units will be paid to you within 30 days after each applicable Vesting Date in Shares (such that one Share Unit equals one share of Teradata Common Stock).









	To the extent that you are a U.S. taxpayer, the Share Units become Vested pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement and your right to receive payment of Vested Share Units constitutes a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then payment of such Share Units shall be subject to the following rules: (i) the Share Units will be paid to you within 30 days after the earlier of (a) your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, or (b) the applicable Vesting Date; (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Share Units become payable as a result of your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (other than as a result of death), and you are a “specified employee” as determined under Teradata's policy for determining specified employees on the date of your separation from service, the Share Units shall be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; and (iii) Teradata may, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), terminate this Agreement and pay all outstanding Share Units to you within 30 days before or 12 months after a “change in the ownership,” a “change in the effective control” or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets” of Teradata within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.









	4.


	By accepting this award, unless disclosure is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, you agree to keep this Agreement confidential and not to disclose its contents to anyone except your attorney, your immediate family, or your financial consultant, provided such persons agree in advance to keep such information confidential and not disclose it to others. The Share Units will be forfeited if you violate the terms and conditions of this Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Teradata agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit you from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”) or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. You do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify Teradata that you have made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right you may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency.









	5.


	The Share Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution upon your death. As soon as practicable after a Vesting Date, Teradata will instruct its transfer agent and/or its third party Plan administrator to record on your account the number of Shares underlying the number of Share Units to be paid to you in Shares and such Shares will be freely transferable.









	6.


	Any cash dividends declared before an applicable Vesting Date on the Shares underlying the Share Units shall not be paid currently, but shall be converted into additional Share Units. Any Share Units resulting from such conversion (the “Dividend Units”) will be considered Share Units for purposes of this Agreement and will be subject to all of the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth herein. As of each date that Teradata would otherwise pay the declared dividend on the Shares underlying the Share Units (the “Dividend Payment Date”) in the absence of the reinvestment requirements of this Section 6, the number of








	2













	Exhibit 10.10.26








	Dividend Units will be determined by dividing the amount of dividends otherwise attributable to the Share Units but not paid on the Dividend Payment Date by the Fair Market Value of Teradata’s Common Stock on the Dividend Payment Date.









	7.


	Regardless of any action Teradata or your employer who is a Teradata affiliate (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all income tax or withholdings, payroll tax, payment on account, social contributions, required deductions, other payments, or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by Teradata or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to you even if technically due by Teradata or the Employer (“Tax-Related Items”), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Teradata or the Employer. You also agree that you solely are responsible for filing all relevant documentation that may be required of you in relation to this award or any Tax-Related Items, such as but not limited to personal income tax returns or reporting statements in relation to the grant or vesting of this award, the holding of Shares or any bank or brokerage account, or the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such award and the receipt of any dividends or Dividend Units. You further acknowledge that Teradata and/or the Employer: (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Share Unit grant, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the Share Units, the issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Units; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Share Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for such Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. You also understand applicable laws may require varying Share or Option valuation methods for purposes of calculating Tax-Related Items, and Teradata assumes no responsibility or liability in relation to any such valuation or for any calculation or reporting of income or Tax-Related Items that may be required of you under applicable law. Further, if you have become subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Teradata and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.




	Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to Teradata or the Employer, to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Teradata and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as Teradata may specify from time to time, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:




	(a)


	    


	withholding from any wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Teradata and/or the Employer;




	(b)


	    


	withholding otherwise deliverable Shares to be issued upon vesting/settlement of the Share Units; or




	(c)


	    


	withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Share Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by Teradata (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization).




	To avoid negative accounting treatment, Teradata may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum and maximum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Vested Share Units, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. You shall pay to Teradata and/or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Teradata and/or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.








	3













	Exhibit 10.10.26








	Teradata may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section 7.




	8.


	You understand and agree that any cross-border cash remittance made in relation to this award, including the transfer of proceeds received upon the sale of Shares, must be made through a locally authorized financial institution or registered foreign exchange agency and may require you to provide to such financial institution or agency certain information regarding the transaction. Moreover, you understand and agree that Teradata is neither responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar (or the selection by Teradata or the Employer in its sole discretion of an applicable foreign currency exchange rate) that may affect the value of this award (or the calculation of income or any Tax-Related Items thereunder) nor liable for any decrease in the value of Shares or this award. In addition, the ownership of Shares or assets and holding of bank or brokerage account abroad may subject you to reporting requirements imposed by tax, banking, and/or other authorities in your country, and you understand and agree that you solely are responsible for complying with such requirements.









	9.


	The Share Units will be forfeited if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause or if the Committee determines that you engaged in misconduct in connection with your employment with Teradata. Further, if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause, then, to the extent demanded by the Committee in its sole discretion and permitted by applicable law, you shall (i) return to Teradata all Shares that you have not disposed of that have been acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of your termination of employment, and (ii) with respect to any Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of your termination of employment and that you have disposed of, pay to Teradata in cash the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date acquired.

(This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of and Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information to which you had access as an employee of Teradata).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 10(a) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.




	(b) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, directly or indirectly recruit, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any exempt employee of Teradata to terminate

(This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the identity of Teradata customers, their needs, interests, strategic plans, etc., all of which is Trade Secret Information you acquired as a Teradata employee with access to such information).









	If you breach the terms of this Section 10, you agree that in addition to any liability you may have for damages arising from such breach, any unvested Share Units will be immediately forfeited, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay to Teradata the Fair Market Value of any Share Units that Vested or cash paid to you in lieu of such Share Units during the twelve (12) months prior to the Termination Date. Such Fair Market Value shall be determined as of each applicable Vesting Date. You understand and agree that Teradata has the right to satisfy your obligation to refund the Fair Market Value of any Share Units that Vested or cash paid in lieu of such Share Units by any method or combination of methods described in Section 7.









	As used in this Section 10, “Competing Organization” means a person or organization which is engaged in or about to become engaged in research on or development, production, marketing, leasing, selling or servicing of a product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and is therefore a competitor of Teradata.

	Form of Restricted Share Unit Agreement




	For Non-U.S. Employees




	Under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan









	You have been awarded a number of restricted share units (the “Share Units”) under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), as described on the restricted share unit information page on the website of Teradata’s third party Plan administrator, subject to the terms and conditions of this Restricted Share Unit Agreement (this “Agreement”) and the Plan. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.




	 




	1.


	The Share Units will become non-forfeitable (“Vested”) on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant (“Vesting Date”), provided that you are continuously and actively employed, as described in Section 11(l) below, by Teradata or any of its affiliate companies (referred to collectively herein as “Teradata”) until the Vesting Date.




	2.


	If your employment with Teradata terminates prior to the Vesting Date due to (i) your death, or (ii) a disability for which you qualify for benefits under the Teradata Long-Term Disability Plan or another long-term disability plan sponsored by Teradata (“Disability”), then, upon such termination of employment, your Share Units will become fully Vested. If your employment with Teradata terminates prior to the Vesting Date due to (a) your Retirement, or (b) a reduction-in-force, then, upon such termination of employment, a pro rata portion of the Share Units will become fully Vested. For purposes of this Agreement, “Retirement” means termination by you of your employment with Teradata (other than, if applicable to you, for Good Reason (as described below) following a Change in Control) at or after age 55 with the consent of the Compensation & Human Resource Committee of the Teradata Board of Directors (the “Committee”), unless otherwise provided for by mandatory local law provisions. The pro rata portion of the Share Units that will become fully Vested in accordance with the preceding sentence will be determined by multiplying the total number of the Share Units awarded pursuant to this Agreement by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months of employment that you completed after the date of grant of this award (the “Date of Grant”), and the denominator of which is the total number of months during the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on the Vesting Date (subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by the third party Plan administrator). For purposes of determining any pro rata Vesting of your Share Units, your period of employment with Teradata shall not include any leave of absence, other than an approved leave of absence from which Teradata reasonably expects that you will return to perform services for Teradata, subject to applicable law.









	Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event a Change in Control occurs and this restricted Share Unit award is not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, the Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately prior to the Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control wherein this restricted Share Unit award is assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, if your employment is terminated by Teradata other than for Cause or Disability during the twenty-four (24) months following the Change in Control, the Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately upon your termination of employment. If you are a participant in the Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan, a Teradata Severance Policy or a similar arrangement that defines “Good Reason” in the context of a resignation following a Change in Control and you terminate your employment for Good Reason as so defined within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control, the Share Units shall become fully Vested immediately upon your termination of employment.













	8













	Exhibit 10.10.26








	3.


	Except as may be otherwise provided in this Section 3, when Vested, the Share Units will be paid to you within 30 days after the Vesting Date in Shares (such that one Share Unit equals one share of Teradata Common Stock).









	To the extent that you are a U.S. taxpayer, the Share Units become Vested pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement and your right to receive payment of Vested Share Units constitutes a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then payment of such Share Units shall be subject to the following rules: (i) the Share Units will be paid to you within 30 days after the earlier of (a) your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, or (b) the Vesting Date; (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Share Units become payable as a result of your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (other than as a result of death), and you are a “specified employee” as determined under Teradata's policy for determining specified employees on the date of your separation from service, the Share Units shall be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following your “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; and (iii) Teradata may, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), terminate this Agreement and pay all outstanding Share Units to you within 30 days before or 12 months after a “change in the ownership,” a “change in the effective control” or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets” of Teradata within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.    









	4.


	By accepting this award, unless disclosure is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, you agree to keep this Agreement confidential and not to disclose its contents to anyone except your attorney, your immediate family, or your financial consultant, provided such persons agree in advance to keep such information confidential and not disclose it to others. The Share Units will be forfeited if you violate the terms and conditions of this Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Teradata agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit you from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”) or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. You do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify Teradata that you have made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right you may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency.









	5.


	The Share Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution upon your death. As soon as practicable after the Vesting Date, Teradata will instruct its transfer agent and/or its third party Plan administrator to record on your account the number of Shares underlying the number of Share Units to be paid to you in Shares and such Shares will be freely transferable.









	6.


	Any cash dividends declared before the Vesting Date on the Shares underlying the Share Units shall not be paid currently, but shall be converted into additional Share Units. Any Share Units resulting from such conversion (the “Dividend Units”) will be considered Share Units for purposes of this Agreement and will be subject to all of the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth herein. As of each date that Teradata would otherwise pay the declared dividend on the Shares underlying the Share Units (the “Dividend Payment Date”) in the absence of the reinvestment requirements of this Section 6, the number of Dividend Units will be determined by dividing the amount of dividends otherwise attributable to the Share Units but not paid on the Dividend Payment Date by the Fair Market Value of Teradata’s Common Stock on the Dividend Payment Date.

	Exhibit 10.10.26








	7.


	Regardless of any action Teradata or your employer who is a Teradata affiliate (the “Employer”) takes with respect to any or all income tax or withholdings, payroll tax, payment on account, social contributions, required deductions, other payments or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by Teradata or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to you even if technically due by Teradata or the Employer (“Tax-Related Items”), you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Teradata or the Employer. You also agree that you solely are responsible for filing all relevant documentation that may be required of you in relation to this award or any Tax-Related Items, such as but not limited to personal income tax returns or reporting statements in relation to the grant or vesting of this award, the holding of Shares or any bank or brokerage account, or the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such award and the receipt of any dividends or Dividend Units. You further acknowledge that Teradata and/or the Employer: (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Share Unit grant, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the Share Units, the issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Units; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Share Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for such Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. You also understand applicable laws may require varying Share or Option valuation methods for purposes of calculating Tax-Related Items, and Teradata assumes no responsibility or liability in relation to any such valuation or for any calculation or reporting of income or Tax-Related Items that may be required of you under applicable law. Further, if you have become subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Teradata and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.




	Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to Teradata or the Employer, to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize Teradata and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as Teradata may specify from time to time, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:




	(a)


	    


	withholding from any wages or other cash compensation paid to you by Teradata and/or the Employer;




	(b)


	    


	withholding otherwise deliverable Shares to be issued upon vesting/settlement of the Share Units; or




	(c)


	    


	withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Share Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by Teradata (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization).




	To avoid negative accounting treatment, Teradata may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum and maximum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Vested Share Units, notwithstanding that a number of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. You shall pay to Teradata and/or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that Teradata and/or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. Teradata may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section 7.

	You understand and agree that any cross-border cash remittance made in relation to this award, including the transfer of proceeds received upon the sale of Shares, must be made through a locally authorized

Moreover, you understand and agree that Teradata is neither responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar (or the selection by Teradata or the Employer in its sole discretion of an applicable foreign currency exchange rate) that may affect the value of this award (or the calculation of income or any Tax-Related Items thereunder) nor liable for any decrease in the value of Shares or this award. In addition, the ownership of Shares or assets and holding of bank or brokerage account abroad may subject you to reporting requirements imposed by tax, banking, and/or other authorities in your country, and you understand and agree that you solely are responsible for complying with such requirements.









	9.


	The Share Units will be forfeited if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause or if the Committee determines that you engaged in misconduct in connection with your employment with Teradata. Further, if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause, then, to the extent demanded by the Committee in its sole discretion and permitted by applicable law, you shall (i) return to Teradata all Shares that you have not disposed of that have been acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of your termination of employment, and (ii) with respect to any Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of your termination of employment and that you have disposed of, pay to Teradata in cash the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date acquired.

	PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED SHARE UNIT AGREEMENT

	Under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan

	(2017 Performance Period Award)




	You have been awarded the contingent right to receive a credit of share units (the “Share Units”) under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Performance-Based Restricted Share Unit Agreement (this “Agreement”) and the Plan. Please refer to the share unit information page on the website of Teradata’s third party Plan administrator for your “Target Number of Share Units.” Teradata Corporation and its affiliate companies are referred to collectively herein as “Teradata.” Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan. It is intended that, if you are a “covered employee” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, any Share Units payable to you under this Agreement will qualify as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, and this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with such intent.




	1.    


	Crediting of Share Units


	.




	(a)    


	In General


	. Your right to receive a credit of all, a portion, or a multiple of the Target Number of Share Units shall be contingent upon the extent to which Teradata Corporation (the “Company”) achieves the performance goals set forth on the attached


	Exhibit A


	 (the “Performance Goals”) for the performance period commencing January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2017 (the “Performance Period”), in accordance with the payout levels set forth on the attached


	Exhibit A


	 (the “Performance Metrics”). The Compensation and Human Resource Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Committee”) may establish special adjustments that will be applied in calculating the extent to which the Performance Goals have been satisfied, provided that the adjustments are set forth in writing no later than 90 days after the beginning of the Performance Period.




	(b)    


	Crediting to Account


	. After the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine in writing the extent, if any, to which the Performance Goals have been satisfied and shall determine the percentage, if any, of the Target Number of Share Units that shall be credited to a book entry account established on your behalf (the “Account”), based on the payout level identified in the Performance Metrics. Each Share Unit credited to your Account under this Section 1(b) shall represent the contingent right to receive one Share and shall at all times be equal in value to one Share. Share Units will be credited effective on the day in which the Committee certifies the achievement of the Performance Goals as provided in this Section 1(b) (the “Crediting Date”). If, upon the conclusion of the Performance Period, the Company achieves less than the threshold level of all of the Performance Goals, then you shall not receive a credit of any Share Units hereunder and this Agreement shall terminate immediately without further action or notice.




	2.     


	Vesting, Forfeiture and Payment of Share Units


	.




	(a)    


	Vesting


	. The Share Units, if any, credited to your Account in accordance with Section 1 above shall be subject to the following vesting schedule:








	1








	Exhibit 10.10.27








	(i)    One-third of the Share Units shall vest on each of the following dates (subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time to time by Teradata’s third party Plan administrator): (A) the Crediting Date, (B) the first anniversary of the Crediting Date, and (C) the second anniversary of the Crediting Date (each a “Vesting Date”), provided that you are continuously employed by Teradata until the applicable Vesting Date.




	(ii)    If you cease to be employed by Teradata due to (A) your death, or (B) your Disability (defined by reference to Teradata’s long-term disability plan that covers you), in either case after the end of the Performance Period but prior to a Vesting Date, then the Share Units shall become fully vested upon such termination.




	(iii)    If you cease to be employed by Teradata prior to a Change in Control due to your Retirement (defined as termination by you of your employment with Teradata at or after age 55 with the consent of the Committee) after the end of the Performance Period but prior to a Vesting Date, then a portion of the Share Units credited to your Account that have not yet vested shall become fully vested upon such termination, determined by multiplying (I) the number of unvested Share Units credited to your Account on the date of termination that would have vested on the next Vesting Date had you remained employed with Teradata through such date, by (II) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months of employment you completed commencing with the Vesting Date that occurred immediately prior to your termination, and the denominator of which is 12 months (subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by Teradata’s third party Plan administrator); provided that if your termination occurs during the period commencing immediately after the end of the Performance Period but prior to the Crediting Date, the fraction described above shall be deemed to be 12/12. For purposes of determining any pro rata vesting of your Share Units, your period of employment with Teradata shall not include any leave of absence, other than an approved leave of absence from which Teradata reasonably expects that you will return to perform services for Teradata. The remaining number of Share Units shall be forfeited without further action or notice.




	(iv)    If a Change in Control occurs after the end of the Performance Period and prior to a Vesting Date, and the Share Units are not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, then the Share Units shall vest upon the Change in Control.




	(v)    If a Change in Control occurs after the end of the Performance Period and prior to a Vesting Date, and the Share Units are assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, then the Share Units shall continue to vest in accordance with Section 2(a)(i); provided, however, that if you cease to be employed by Teradata due to (A) termination of your employment by Teradata without Cause, (B) termination of your employment with Teradata on account of death, Disability, or Retirement, or (C) if you are a participant in the Teradata Change in Control Severance Plan, a Teradata Severance Policy or a similar arrangement that defines “Good Reason” in the context of a resignation following a Change in Control (a “CIC Plan”), termination of your employment with Teradata for “Good Reason” as defined in the CIC Plan within the two-year period commencing on the Change in Control, then the Share Units credited to your Account that have not yet vested shall vest in full upon such termination.








	2








	Exhibit 10.10.27








	(b)     


	Forfeiture


	. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3, your right to receive a credit of Share Units shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice in the event that you cease to be employed by Teradata through the end of the Performance Period. The Share Units credited to your Account that have not yet vested pursuant to Section 2(a) shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice if you cease to be employed by Teradata prior to a Vesting Date other than as provided in Sections 2(a)(ii), (iii) or (v).




	(c)    


	Payment


	. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3 or Section 4 of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver the Shares underlying the vested Share Units credited to your Account in accordance with this Agreement within seventy (70) days after the earlier of (i) the applicable Vesting Date(s), or (ii) your termination of employment.




	3.    


	Certain Events During Performance Period


	.




	(a)     


	Certain Terminations


	. If during the Performance Period you cease to be employed by Teradata prior to a Change in Control due to death, Disability, or Retirement then the Company shall credit to your Account a pro-rated number of Share Units, which shall be fully vested, and which shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the actual number of Share Units that would have been credited to your Account in accordance with Section 1 of this Agreement had you continued in employment throughout the Performance Period, determined by the Committee based on the actual performance of the Company during such Performance Period, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months of employment you completed commencing with January 1, 2017, and the denominator of which is 36 months (subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by Teradata’s third party Plan administrator). For purposes of determining any pro rata vesting of your Share Units, your period of employment with Teradata shall not include any leave of absence, other than an approved leave of absence from which Teradata reasonably expects that you will return to perform services for Teradata. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the pro-rated number of Share Units within seventy (70) days after the end of the Performance Period.




	(b)    


	Change in Control


	.




	(i)    If a Change in Control occurs during the Performance Period, and this award is not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, then the Target Number of Share Units shall be credited to your Account, as of the date of the Change in Control, and the units shall be fully vested at that time. The Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the Target Number of Share Units within 30 days after such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that your right to receive such Shares constitutes a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”), the Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the Target Number of Share Units within seventy (70) days after the earlier of (A) the end of the Performance Period, or (B) your termination of employment (except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of this Agreement).




	(ii)    If a Change in Control occurs during the Performance Period, and this award is assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, then the Target Number of








	3








	Exhibit 10.10.27








	Share Units shall be credited to your Account, as of the date of the Change in Control, and the Share Units shall continue to vest in accordance with Section 2(a)(i); provided, however, that if you cease to be employed by Teradata due to (A) termination of your employment by Teradata without Cause, (B) termination of your employment with Teradata on account of death, Disability, or Retirement, or (C) if you are a participant in a CIC Plan, termination of your employment with Teradata for “Good Reason” as defined in the CIC Plan within the two-year period commencing on the Change in Control, then the Share Units credited to your Account that have not yet vested shall vest in full upon such termination. If the Target Number of Share Units credited to your Account in accordance with this Section 3(b)(ii) becomes vested by reason of a termination of your employment that occurs on or prior to the end of the Performance Period, then, except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the Target Number of Share Units within seventy (70) days after the end of the Performance Period. If the Target Number of Share Units credited to your Account in accordance with this Section 3(b)(ii) becomes vested after the end of the Performance Period, then except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver the Shares underlying the vested Target Number of Share Units credited to your Account within seventy (70) days after the earlier of (x) the applicable Vesting Date(s), or (y) your termination of employment.




	4.    


	Section 409A Compliance


	. The intent of the parties is that payments under this Agreement comply with Section 409A or are exempt therefrom and this Agreement shall be interpreted, administered and governed in accordance with such intent.




	(a)    


	Termination of Employment


	. To the extent that you are a U.S. taxpayer, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of Shares subject to Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A and you are no longer providing services (at a level that would preclude the occurrence of a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A) to Teradata as an employee or consultant, and for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.




	(b)    


	Payment Delay for Specified Employees


	. If you are a “specified employee,” as determined under the Company’s policy for identifying specified employees on the date of termination, then to the extent required in order to comply with Section 409A, all payments made under this Agreement that constitute a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A that are provided as a result of a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A for any reason other than your death and that would otherwise be paid or provided during the first six months following such separation from service shall be accumulated through and paid within 30 days after the first business day that is more than six months after the date of your separation from service (or, if you die during such six-month period, within 30 days after your death).




	(c)    


	Acceleration of Payment


	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Committee shall have the right, at any time in its sole discretion, to accelerate the time of a payment under this Agreement to a time otherwise permitted under Section








	4








	Exhibit 10.10.27








	409A in accordance with the requirements, restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j).




	5.     


	Confidentiality


	. By accepting this award, unless disclosure is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, you agree to keep this Agreement confidential and not to disclose its contents to anyone except your attorney, your immediate family, or your financial consultant, provided such persons agree in advance to keep such information confidential and not disclose it to others. The Share Units will be forfeited if you violate the terms and conditions of this Section 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Teradata agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit you from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”) or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. You do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify Teradata that you have made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right you may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency.




	6.     


	Transferability


	. The Share Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated, except by beneficiary designation, will or by the laws of descent and distribution upon your death. Any purported transfer or encumbrance in violation of the provisions of this Section 6 shall be void, and the other party to any such purported transaction shall not obtain any rights to or interest in such Share Units.




	     7.     


	Dividend Equivalents


	. From and after the Crediting Date and until the earlier of (a) the time when the Share Units are paid in accordance with this Agreement or (b) the time when your rights in the Share Units are forfeited in accordance with Section 2(b) hereof, on the date that Teradata pays a cash dividend (if any) to holders of Shares generally, you shall receive additional Share Units equal to (x) the number of Share Units held by you as of the date of record for such dividend, provided that the record date occurs on or after the Crediting Date; multiplied by (y) the per Share cash dividend amount; divided by (z) the Fair Market Value per Share on the dividend payment date. The additional Share Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Share Units covered by this Agreement, including without limitation the forfeiture provisions of Section 2(b) of this Agreement; provided, however, that for purposes of Section 2(a)(i) of this Agreement (i) any such additional Share Units issued between the Crediting Date and the first anniversary of the Crediting Date shall vest in two equal installments on the first anniversary of the Crediting Date and the second anniversary of the Crediting Date, provided that you are continuously employed by Teradata through each such date, and (ii) any such additional Share Units issued between the first anniversary of the Crediting Date and the second anniversary of the Crediting Date shall vest on the second anniversary of the Crediting Date, provided that you are continuously employed by Teradata through such date.






	8.    


	Misconduct; Termination for Cause


	. The Share Units will be forfeited if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause or if the Committee determines that you engaged in misconduct in connection with your employment with Teradata. Further, if your employment is








	5








	Exhibit 10.10.27








	terminated by Teradata for Cause, then, to the extent demanded by the Committee in its sole discretion and permitted by applicable law, you shall (a) return to Teradata all Shares that you have not disposed of that have been acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of termination of your employment, and (b) with respect to any Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of termination of your employment and that you have disposed of, pay to Teradata in cash the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date acquired.




	9.     


	Tax-Related Items and




	Withholding


	. Teradata has the right to deduct or cause to be deducted, or collect or cause to be collected, with respect to the taxation of any Share Units, the issuance or sale of Shares, and the receipt of dividends or dividend equivalents, if any, or otherwise in relation to you participation in the Plan, any federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes, social contributions, required deductions, or other payments required by the laws of the United States or any other country to be withheld or paid with respect to the Share Units or related to or resulting from your participation in the Plan (“Tax-Related Items”), and you or your legal representative or beneficiary will be required to pay any such amounts. By accepting this award, you consent and direct that, if you are paid through Teradata’s United States payroll system at the time the Share Units are settled, Teradata’s stock plan administrator will withhold or sell the number of Shares underlying the Share Units as Teradata, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to satisfy such Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that if Teradata is required to withhold any taxes prior to settlement of the Share Units, then you agree that Teradata may satisfy those withholding obligations by withholding cash from your compensation otherwise due to you or by any other action as it may deem necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation. In no event shall the Fair Market Value of the Shares of common stock to be surrendered pursuant to this Section 9 to satisfy applicable withholding taxes exceed the minimum amount of taxes required to be withheld or such other amount that will not result in a negative accounting impact. If you are paid through a non-United States Teradata payroll system, you agree that Teradata may satisfy any Tax-Related Items by withholding cash from your compensation otherwise due to you or by any other action as it may deem necessary to satisfy the Tax-Related Items. Regardless of any action Teradata or your employer takes with regards to any Tax-Related Items, you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Teradata or the employer. You also agree that you solely are responsible for filing all relevant documentation that may be required of you in relation to this award or any Tax-Related Items, such as but not limited to personal income tax returns or reporting statements in relation to the grant or vesting of this award or the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such award and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents.




	10.

(This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of and Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information to which you had access as an employee of Teradata).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 10(a) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.




	(b) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, directly or indirectly recruit, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any exempt employee of Teradata to terminate his or her employment with or otherwise cease his or her relationship with Teradata.

(This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the identity of Teradata customers, their needs, interests, strategic plans, etc., all of which is Trade Secret Information you acquired as a Teradata employee with access to such information).




	If you breach the terms of this Section 10, you agree that in addition to any liability you may have for damages arising from such breach, any unvested Share Units will be immediately forfeited, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay to Teradata the Fair Market Value of any Share Units that vested during the twelve (12) months prior to the Termination Date.

	Arbitration


	. By accepting this award, you agree that, where permitted by local law, any controversy or claim arising out of or related to your employment relationship with Teradata shall be resolved by first exhausting any Teradata internal dispute resolution process and policy, and then by arbitration pursuant to such policy.

Any other Share Units not designated by you will be distributable to your estate. If there is any question as to the legal right of any beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder, the Share Units in question may be transferred to your estate, in which event Teradata will have no further liability to anyone with respect to such Share Units.

	Dividend; Voting Rights


	. You shall not possess any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in the Shares underlying the Share Units credited to your Account until such Shares have been delivered to you in accordance with this Agreement. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement will be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Company to deliver Shares in the future, and your rights will be no greater than that of an unsecured general creditor.

	.

Furthermore, nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon you any right to receive any future Share Units or awards under the Plan or the inclusion of the value of any awards in the calculation of severance payments, if any, upon termination of employment. The Share Units are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way, to past services for Teradata.




	20.    


	Non-U.S. Employees


	. Notwithstanding any provision herein, if the Plan or your employment with Teradata or your participation in the Plan is subject to the rules and regulations of one or more non-United States jurisdictions, then your participation in the Plan shall be subject to any such rules and regulations and any disclosures or special terms and conditions as may be set forth in (but are not limited to) any appendix for your country (the “Appendix”). Moreover, if you

	Exhibit 10.10.27








	relocate to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the disclosures and special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such disclosures, terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan.

The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement.




	For purposes of the vesting and forfeiture provisions above, the termination of your employment will be deemed effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period or “garden leave” that may be mandated contractually or under applicable law; the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of your Share Unit grant.




	You also understand and agree that any cross-border cash remittance made in relation to this award, including the transfer of proceeds received upon the sale of Shares, must be made through a locally authorized financial institution or registered foreign exchange agency and may require you to provide to such financial institution or agency certain information regarding the transaction. Moreover, you understand and agree that the future value of Shares is unknown and the Company is neither responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar (or the selection by Teradata or the employer in its sole discretion of an applicable foreign currency exchange rate) that may affect the value of this award (or the calculation of income or any Tax-Related Items thereunder)




	nor liable for any decrease in the value of Shares or this award.

	You further acknowledge that Teradata and your employer: (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Share Unit grant, including the grant, crediting, vesting or settlement of the Share Units, the issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends and/or dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Share Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for such Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. You also understand applicable laws may require varying Share or Share Unit valuation methods for purposes of calculating Tax-Related Items, and Teradata assumes no responsibility or liability in relation to any such valuation or for any calculation or reporting of income or Tax-Related Items that may be required of you under applicable law. Further, if you have become subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Teradata and/or your employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

	Exhibit 10.10.28








	PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED SHARE UNIT AGREEMENT





	Under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan




	(Relative TSR Award)









	You have been awarded the contingent right to receive a credit of share units (the “Share Units”) under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Performance-Based Restricted Share Unit Agreement (this “Agreement”) and the Plan. Please refer to the share unit information page on the website of Teradata’s third party Plan administrator for your “Target Number of Share Units.” Teradata Corporation and its affiliate companies are referred to collectively herein as “Teradata.” Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan. It is intended that, if you are a “covered employee” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, any Share Units payable to you under this Agreement will qualify as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, and this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with such intent.




	1.    


	Crediting of Share Units


	.




	(a)    


	Relative TSR Performance Objective


	. Your right to receive a credit of all, a portion, or a multiple of the Target Number of Share Units shall be contingent upon Teradata’s Relative TSR (as defined below) for the period commencing January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2019 (the “Performance Period”), as determined in accordance with the performance matrix attached as Exhibit A (the “Performance Matrix”), and the satisfaction of the other terms and conditions of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement:




	(i)     “Relative TSR” means the percentile ranking of Teradata’s TSR relative to the TSR of the other companies included in the S&P Composite 1500 Information Technology Index for the entirety of the Performance Period (the “Peer Companies”). Relative TSR will be determined by ranking Teradata and the Peer Companies from highest to lowest according to their respective TSRs. After this ranking, the percentile performance of Teradata relative to the Peer Companies will be determined as follows:






	P =     


	N – R







	        N – 1




	where:    “P” represents the percentile performance which will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole percentile by application of regular rounding.




	“N” represents the remaining number of Peer Companies, plus Teradata.




	“R” represents Teradata’s ranking among the Peer Companies.




	Example:


	If there are 239 Peer Companies, and Teradata ranked 67



	th



	, the performance would be at the 72



	nd



	 percentile: .72 = (240 – 67)/(240 – 1)




	(ii)    “TSR” means, with respect to any company, the percentage growth in total stockholder return, determined by dividing (A) the appreciation in price of a share of the company’s common stock from the Opening Value (as defined below) to the Closing








	1








	Exhibit 10.10.28








	Value (as defined below), plus any dividends paid during the Performance Period (which shall be deemed reinvested in the company’s common stock on the ex-dividend date), by (B) the Opening Value;




	(iii)    “Opening Value” means, with respect to any company, the average of the closing prices per share of the company’s common stock for all trading days in the 90 calendar day period ending on and including December 31, 2016, assuming any dividends paid during the 90 calendar day period are reinvested in the company’s common stock on the ex-dividend date; and




	(iv)    “Closing Value” means, with respect to any company, the average of the closing prices per share of the company’s common stock for all trading days in the 90 calendar day period ending on and including the last day of the Performance Period, assuming any dividends paid during the 90 calendar day period are reinvested in the company’s common stock on the ex-dividend date.




	(b)    


	Additional Limitations


	. The number of Share Units (if any) credited to your account under the Agreement will be determined in accordance with the Performance Matrix; provided, however, that (i) if Teradata’s (absolute) TSR for the Performance Period is negative, then the number of Share Units credited to your account under the Agreement will not exceed the Target Number of Share Units; and (ii) in no event will the value of the Share Units credited to your account hereunder, determined based on the closing price per Share on December 31, 2019 (or, if applicable, the date immediately prior to a Change in Control described in Section 2(c) below), exceed four (4) times the value of the Target Number of Share Units determined based on the closing price on the Date of Grant (as adjusted by the Committee in the event of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization or similar transaction after the Date of Grant and during the Performance Period). An illustration of the limitation imposed by clause (ii) of this Section 1(b) is provided in Exhibit B.




	(c)     


	Crediting to Account


	. After the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine in writing Teradata’s (absolute) TSR and Relative TSR for the Performance Period and the number of Share Units (if any) earned in accordance with this Agreement, which Share Units shall be credited to a book entry account established on your behalf (the “Account”). Each Share Unit credited to your Account under this Section 1(b) shall represent the contingent right to receive one Share and shall at all times be equal in value to one Share.




	(d)    


	Forfeiture of Share Units


	. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2, your right to receive a credit of Share Units shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice in the event that Teradata’s Relative TSR for the Performance Period is below the threshold level specified in the Performance Matrix.




	2.     


	Vesting, Forfeiture and Payment of Share Units


	.




	(a)    


	Vesting


	. Provided that you are continuously employed by Teradata through December 31, 2019, the Share Units (if any) credited to your Account in accordance with Section








	2








	Exhibit 10.10.28








	1 above shall be fully vested, and the Company will deliver the Shares underlying the vested Share Units within seventy (70) days after December 31, 2019.




	(b)    


	Certain Terminations


	. If during the Performance Period and prior to a Change in Control you cease to be employed by Teradata due to death, Disability (defined by reference to Teradata’s long-term disability plan that covers you), Retirement (defined as termination by you of your employment with Teradata at or after age 55 with the consent of the Committee) or a reduction-in-force, then the Company shall credit to your Account a pro-rated number of Share Units, which shall be fully vested, and which shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the actual number of Share Units (if any) that would have been credited to your Account in accordance with Section 1 of this Agreement had you continued in employment throughout the Performance Period, determined by the Committee based on the actual performance of the Company during the Performance Period, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months of employment you completed commencing with January 1, 2017, and the denominator of which is 36 months (subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by Teradata’s third party Plan administrator). For purposes of determining any pro rata vesting of your Share Units, your period of employment with Teradata shall not include any leave of absence, other than an approved leave of absence from which Teradata reasonably expects that you will return to perform services for Teradata. The Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the pro-rated number of Share Units (if any) that become vested pursuant to this Section 2(b) within seventy (70) days after December 31, 2019.




	(c)    


	Change in Control


	.




	(i)    If a Change in Control occurs prior to December 31, 2019 and this award is not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, then the Company shall credit to your Account, as of the date of the Change in Control, a number of fully vested Share Units determined as follows: (A) if the Change in Control occurs during 2017, the number of fully vested Share Units credited to your Account hereunder shall be the Target Number of Share Units, and (B) if the Change in Control occurs during 2018 or 2019, the number of fully vested Share Units credited to your Account hereunder shall be determined based on the actual performance of the Company during the period commencing January 1, 2017 and ending immediately prior to the Change in Control (which period shall be treated as the “Performance Period” for all purposes under this Agreement). The Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the Target Number of Share Units within 30 days after such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that your right to receive such Shares constitutes a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A”), the Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the vested Share Units credited to your Account within seventy (70) days after the earlier of (A) December 31, 2019, or (B) your termination of employment (except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Agreement).




	(ii)    If a Change in Control occurs prior to December 31, 2019 and this award is assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, then the Company shall credit to your Account, as of the date of the Change in Control, a number of Share Units determined as follows: (A) if the Change in Control occurs during 2017, the number of Share Units credited to








	3








	Exhibit 10.10.28








	your Account hereunder shall be the Target Number of Share Units, and (B) if the Change in Control occurs during 2018 or 2019, the number of Share Units credited to your Account hereunder shall be determined based on the actual performance of the Company during the period commencing January 1, 2017 and ending immediately prior to the Change in Control (which period shall be treated as the “Performance Period” for all purposes under this Agreement). Any Share Units credited to your Account in accordance with this Section 2(c)(ii) shall continue to vest based solely upon your continued employment in accordance with Section 2(a); provided, however, that if you cease to be employed by Teradata due to (x) termination of your employment by Teradata without Cause, (y) termination of your employment with Teradata on account of death, Disability, Retirement or a reduction-in-force, or (z) if you are a participant in a CIC Plan, termination of your employment with Teradata for “Good Reason” as defined in the CIC Plan within the two-year period commencing on the Change in Control, then the Share Units credited to your Account in accordance with this Section 2(c)(ii) that have not yet vested shall vest in full upon such termination. If the Share Units credited to your Account in accordance with this Section 2(c)(ii) become vested by reason of a termination of your employment, then, except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver the Shares underlying the vested Share Units credited to your Account within seventy (70) days after the earlier of (I) December 31, 2019, or (II) your termination of employment.




	(d)     


	Forfeiture


	. Except as otherwise provided above, your right to receive a credit of Share Units shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice in the event that you cease to be continuously employed by Teradata through December 31, 2019.




	3.    


	Section 409A Compliance


	. The intent of the parties is that payments under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code or are exempt therefrom and this Agreement shall be interpreted, administered and governed in accordance with such intent.




	(a)    


	Termination of Employment


	. To the extent that you are a U.S. taxpayer, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of Shares subject to Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A and you are no longer providing services (at a level that would preclude the occurrence of a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A) to Teradata as an employee or consultant, and for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.




	(b)    


	Payment Delay for Specified Employees


	. If you are a “specified employee,” as determined under the Company’s policy for identifying specified employees on the date of termination, then to the extent required in order to comply with Section 409A, all payments made under this Agreement that constitute a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A that are provided as a result of a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A for any reason other than your death and that would otherwise be paid or provided during the first six months following such separation from service shall be accumulated through and paid








	4








	Exhibit 10.10.28








	within 30 days after the first business day that is more than six months after the date of your separation from service (or, if you die during such six-month period, within 30 days after your death).




	(c)    


	Acceleration of Payment


	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Committee shall have the right, at any time in its sole discretion, to accelerate the time of a payment under this Agreement to a time otherwise permitted under Section 409A in accordance with the requirements, restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j).




	4.     


	Confidentiality


	. By accepting this award, unless disclosure is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, you agree to keep this Agreement confidential and not to disclose its contents to anyone except your attorney, your immediate family, or your financial consultant, provided such persons agree in advance to keep such information confidential and not disclose it to others. The Share Units will be forfeited if you violate the terms and conditions of this Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Teradata agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit you from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”) or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. You do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify Teradata that you have made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right you may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency.




	5.     


	Transferability


	. The Share Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated, except by beneficiary designation, will or by the laws of descent and distribution upon your death. Any purported transfer or encumbrance in violation of the provisions of this Section 5 shall be void, and the other party to any such purported transaction shall not obtain any rights to or interest in such Share Units.




	     6.     


	Dividend Equivalents


	. From and after the date that any vested Share Units are credited to your Account pursuant to Section 1 hereof (the “Crediting Date”) and until the time when the Share Units are paid in accordance with this Agreement, on the date that Teradata pays a cash dividend (if any) to holders of Shares generally, you shall receive additional Share Units equal to (x) the number of Share Units held by you as of the date of record for such dividend, provided that the record date occurs on or after the Crediting Date; multiplied by (y) the per Share cash dividend amount; divided by (z) the Fair Market Value per Share on the dividend payment date. The additional Share Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Share Units covered by this Agreement, including without limitation the forfeiture and repayment provisions of Sections 7 and 11 of this Agreement.






	7.    


	Misconduct; Termination for Cause


	. The Share Units will be forfeited if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause or if the Committee determines that you engaged in misconduct in connection with your employment with Teradata. Further, if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause, then, to the extent demanded by the Committee in its sole discretion and permitted by applicable law, you shall (a) return to Teradata all Shares that you have








	5








	Exhibit 10.10.28








	not disposed of that have been acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of termination of your employment, and (b) with respect to any Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of termination of your employment and that you have disposed of, pay to Teradata in cash the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date acquired.




	8.     


	Tax-Related Items and




	Withholding


	. Teradata has the right to deduct or cause to be deducted, or collect or cause to be collected, with respect to the taxation of any Share Units, the issuance or sale of Shares, and the receipt of dividends or dividend equivalents, if any or otherwise in relation to participation in the Plan, any federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes, social contributions, required deductions, or other payments required by the laws of the United States or any other country to be withheld or paid with respect to the Share Units or related to or resulting from your participation in the Plan (“Tax-Related Items”), and you or your legal representative or beneficiary will be required to pay any such amounts. By accepting this award, you consent and direct that, if you are paid through Teradata’s United States payroll system at the time the Share Units are settled, Teradata’s stock plan administrator will withhold or sell the number of Shares underlying the Share Units as Teradata, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to satisfy such Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that if Teradata is required to withhold any taxes prior to settlement of the Share Units, then you agree that Teradata may satisfy those withholding obligations by withholding cash from your compensation otherwise due to you or by any other action as it may deem necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation. If you are paid through a non-United States Teradata payroll system, you agree that Teradata may satisfy any Tax-Related Items by withholding cash from your compensation otherwise due to you or by any other action as it may deem necessary to satisfy the Tax-Related Items. The value of any Shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding requirements hereunder will not exceed the minimum amount of taxes required to be withheld or such other amount that will not result in a negative accounting impact. Regardless of any action Teradata or your employer takes with regards to any Tax-Related Items, you acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Teradata or the employer. You also agree that you solely are responsible for filing all relevant documentation that may be required of you in relation to this award or any Tax-Related Items, such as but not limited to personal income tax returns or reporting statements in relation to the grant or vesting of this award or the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such award and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents.




	9.        


	Restrictive Covenants


	. As a recipient of this equity award, you recognize that you have access to highly confidential, proprietary and non-public information of Teradata and its customers, including strategic plans, customer lists, research and development plans, and other information not made available to the general public and from which Teradata derives value. For purposes of this Agreement, this information is defined as “Trade Secret Information.”









	To protect Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information, and in exchange for the Share Units, you agree that the following restrictions will apply during your employment with Teradata and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, for a period of twelve (12) months after the date that you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason (the “Termination Date”) (or if applicable law








	6

(This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of and Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information to which you had access as an employee of Teradata).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9(a) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.









	(b) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, directly or indirectly recruit, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any exempt employee of Teradata to terminate his or her employment with or otherwise cease his or her relationship with Teradata. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the information you obtained while a Teradata employee regarding the skills, experience and knowledge of Teradata employees, which is Trade Secret Information, and Teradata’s investment in developing these employees).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9(b) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.









	(c) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of Teradata, solicit the business of any firm or company with which you worked during the preceding twelve (12) months of employment at Teradata, if such firm or company was a customer of Teradata, by using Teradata Trade Secret Information. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the identity of Teradata customers, their needs, interests, strategic plans, etc., all of which is Trade Secret Information you acquired as a Teradata employee with access to such information).









	If you breach the terms of this Section 9, you agree that in addition to any liability you may have for damages arising from such breach, any unvested Share Units will be immediately forfeited, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay to Teradata the Fair Market Value of any Share Units that vested during the twelve (12) months prior to the Termination Date. Such Fair Market Value shall be determined as of the applicable vesting date of the Share Units.









	As used in this Section 9, “Competing Organization” means a person or organization which is engaged in or about to become engaged in research on or development, production, marketing, leasing, selling or servicing of a product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and is therefore a competitor of Teradata.

	10.    


	Arbitration


	. By accepting this award, you agree that, where permitted by local law, any controversy or claim arising out of or related to your employment relationship with Teradata shall be resolved by first exhausting any Teradata internal dispute resolution process and policy, and then by arbitration pursuant to such policy. If you are employed outside the United States, where permitted by local law, the arbitration shall be conducted in the regional headquarters city of the business unit in which you work. The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator who is an attorney knowledgeable in employment law. The arbitrator’s decision and award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. For arbitrations held in the United States, issues of arbitrability shall be determined in accordance with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; all other aspects shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state in which the headquarters of Teradata is located. Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees associated with the arbitration and other costs and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne as provided by the rules of the American Arbitration Association for an arbitration held in the United States, or similar applicable rules for an arbitration held outside the United States.









	Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, you acknowledge that if you breach Section 9, Teradata will sustain irreparable injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law. As a result, you agree that in the event of your breach of Section 9 Teradata may, in addition to any other remedies available to it, bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable relief to preserve the status quo pending appointment of an arbitrator and completion of an arbitration. You stipulate to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in the location from which Teradata’s equity programs are administered, for any such proceedings.

	Successors


	.




	(a)    Without limiting Section 5 of this Agreement, you may designate one or more beneficiaries to receive all or part of any Share Units to be distributed in case of your death, and you may change or revoke such designation at any time. In the event of your death, any Share Units distributable hereunder that are subject to such a designation will be distributed to such beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with this Agreement. Any other Share Units not designated by you will be distributable to your estate. If there is any question as to the legal right of any beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder, the Share Units in question may be transferred to your estate, in which event Teradata will have no further liability to anyone with respect to such Share Units.

	Exhibit 10.10.28








	(b)    The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, your successors, administrators, heirs, legal representatives and assigns, and the successors and assigns of the Company.




	13.     


	Severability


	. The provisions of this Agreement are severable. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction (including an arbitration tribunal), it shall be severed and shall not affect any other part of this Agreement, which will be enforced as permitted by law.

	. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Plan, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail, except that with respect to matters involving choice of law, the terms and conditions of Section 10 of this Agreement shall prevail.




	17.    


	Dividend; Voting Rights


	. You shall not possess any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in the Shares underlying the Share Units credited to your Account until such Shares have been delivered to you in accordance with this Agreement. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement will be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Company to deliver Shares in the future, and your rights will be no greater than that of an unsecured general creditor. No assets of the Company will be held or set aside as security for the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.




	18.    


	No Employment Contract or Acquired Rights


	. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon you any right with respect to continuance of employment by Teradata, nor limit or affect in any manner the right of Teradata to terminate your employment or adjust your compensation, subject to applicable law. Furthermore, nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon you any right to receive any future Share Units or awards under the Plan or the inclusion of the value of any awards in the calculation of severance payments, if any, upon termination of employment. The Share Units are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way, to past services for Teradata.




	19.    


	Non-U.S. Employees


	. Notwithstanding any provision herein, if the Plan or your employment with Teradata or your participation in the Plan is subject to the rules and regulations of one or more non-United States jurisdictions, then your participation in the Plan shall be subject to any such rules and regulations and any disclosures or special terms and conditions as set forth in (but not limited to) any appendix for your country (the “


	Appendix


	”). Moreover, if you relocate








	9








	Exhibit 10.10.28








	to one of the countries included in the Appendix, the disclosures and special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such disclosures, terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan. The Company also reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan to the extent the Company determines it necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or facilitate the administration of the Plan and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing. The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement.




	For purposes of the vesting and forfeiture provisions above, the termination of your employment will be deemed effective as of the date that you are no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period or “garden leave” that may be mandated contractually or under applicable law; the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively employed for purposes of your Share Unit grant.




	You also understand and agree that any cross-border cash remittance made in relation to this award, including the transfer of proceeds received upon the sale of Shares, must be made through a locally authorized financial institution or registered foreign exchange agency and may require you to provide to such financial institution or agency certain information regarding the transaction. Moreover, you understand and agree that the future value of Shares is unknown and the Company is neither responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar (or the selection by Teradata or the employer in its sole discretion of an applicable foreign currency exchange rate) that may affect the value of this award (or the calculation of income or any Tax-Related Items thereunder)




	nor liable for any decrease in the value of Shares or this award. In addition, the ownership of Shares or assets and holding of bank or brokerage account abroad may subject you to reporting requirements imposed by tax, banking, and/or other authorities in your country, and you understand and agree that you solely are responsible for complying with such requirements.




	You further acknowledge that Teradata and your employer: (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Share Unit grant, including the grant, crediting, vesting or settlement of the Share Units, the issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends and/or dividend equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Share Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for such Tax-Related Items or to achieve any particular tax result. You also understand applicable laws may require varying Share or Share Unit valuation methods for purposes of calculating Tax-Related Items, and Teradata assumes no responsibility or liability in relation to any such valuation or for any calculation or reporting of income or Tax-Related Items that may be required of you under applicable law. Further, if you have become subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that Teradata and/or your employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.

	Data Privacy Consent


	. You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other Share Unit grant materials by and among, as applicable, the employer and Teradata for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.




	You understand that Teradata and the employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in Teradata, details of all Share Units or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan (“Data”).

	APPENDIX









	This Appendix includes additional country-specific notices, disclaimers, terms and conditions that govern the Share Units granted to you under the Plan if you work or reside outside the U.S. and/or in one of the countries listed below. Such terms and conditions and disclosures may also apply, as from the date of grant, if you move to or otherwise are or become subject to applicable laws or Company policies of a specified country. Certain capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix have the meanings set forth in the Plan and/or the Agreement. This Appendix forms part of the Agreement and should be read in conjunction with the Agreement and the Plan.




	This Appendix may also include information you should be aware of with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect as of November 2016; however, such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that you not rely on the Appendix as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the Plan because the information may be out of date at the time that your Share Units vest or you sell Shares acquired under the Plan. In addition, the information contained herein is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure you of any particular result. Accordingly, you are advised to seek appropriate professional legal and tax advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply to your situation. Finally, if you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently working, the information contained herein may not be applicable to you.




	Securities Law Notice:


	 Unless otherwise noted, neither the Company nor the Shares are registered with any local stock exchange or under the control of any local securities regulator outside the U.S. This Agreement (of which this Appendix is a part), the Plan, and any other communications or materials that you may receive regarding participation in the Plan do not constitute advertising or an offering of securities outside the U.S. The issuance of securities described in any Plan-related documents is not intended for offering or public circulation in your jurisdiction.

	CEO PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED SHARE UNIT AGREEMENT

	Under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan

	(2017 Performance Period Award)




	You have been awarded the contingent right to receive a credit of share units (the “Share Units”) under the Teradata 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Performance-Based Restricted Share Unit Agreement (this “Agreement”) and the Plan. Please refer to the share unit information page on the website of Teradata’s third party Plan administrator for your “Target Number of Share Units.” Teradata Corporation and its affiliate companies are referred to collectively herein as “Teradata.” Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan. It is intended that, if you are a “covered employee” within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, any Share Units payable to you under this Agreement will qualify as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, and this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with such intent.




	1.    


	Crediting of Share Units


	.




	(a)    


	In General


	. Your right to receive a credit of all, a portion, or a multiple of the Target Number of Share Units shall be contingent upon the extent to which Teradata Corporation (the “Company”) achieves the performance goals set forth on the attached


	Exhibit A


	 (the “Performance Goals”) for the performance period commencing January 1, 2017 and ending December 31, 2017 (the “Performance Period”), in accordance with the payout levels set forth on the attached


	Exhibit A


	 (the “Performance Metrics”). The Compensation and Human Resource Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Committee”) may establish special adjustments that will be applied in calculating the extent to which the Performance Goals have been satisfied, provided that the adjustments are set forth in writing no later than 90 days after the beginning of the Performance Period.




	(b)    


	Crediting to Account


	. After the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine in writing the extent, if any, to which the Performance Goals have been satisfied and shall determine the percentage, if any, of the Target Number of Share Units that shall be credited to a book entry account established on your behalf (the “Account”), based on the payout level identified in the Performance Metrics. Each Share Unit credited to your Account under this Section 1(b) shall represent the contingent right to receive one Share and shall at all times be equal in value to one Share. Share Units will be credited effective on the day in which the Committee certifies the achievement of the Performance Goals as provided in this Section 1(b) (the “Crediting Date”). If, upon the conclusion of the Performance Period, the Company achieves less than the threshold level of all of the Performance Goals, then you shall not receive a credit of any Share Units hereunder and this Agreement shall terminate immediately without further action or notice.




	2.     


	Vesting, Forfeiture and Payment of Share Units


	.




	(a)    


	Vesting


	. Provided that you are continuously employed by Teradata through December 31, 2017, the Share Units, if any, credited to your Account in accordance with Section 1 above shall be fully vested.








	1








	Exhibit 10.10.29








	(b)     


	Forfeiture


	. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3, your right to receive a credit of Share Units shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice in the event that you cease to be employed by Teradata through the end of the Performance Period.




	(c)    


	Payment


	. Except as otherwise provided in Section 3 or Section 4 of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver the Shares underlying one-third of the vested Share Units credited to your Account pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement within seventy (70) days after each of (i) the Crediting Date, (ii) the first anniversary of the Crediting Date, and (iii) the second anniversary of the Crediting Date (each a “Payment Date”); provided, however, that if your employment with Teradata terminates for any reason (other than a termination of your employment by Teradata for Cause) after the end of the Performance Period and prior to a Payment Date, the Company shall deliver the Shares underlying all vested but outstanding Share Units credited to your Account within seventy (70) days after your termination of employment (or at such later time as may be required pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement).




	3.    


	Certain Events During Performance Period


	.




	(a)     


	Certain Terminations


	. If during the Performance Period you cease to be employed by Teradata prior to a Change in Control for any reason other than a termination of your employment by Teradata for Cause, the Company shall credit to your Account a pro-rated number of Share Units, which shall be fully vested, and which shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the actual number of Share Units that would have been credited to your Account in accordance with Section 1 of this Agreement had you continued in employment throughout the Performance Period, determined by the Committee based on the actual performance of the Company during such Performance Period, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months of employment you completed commencing with January 1, 2017, and the denominator of which is 12 months (subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by Teradata’s third party Plan administrator). For purposes of determining any pro rata vesting of your Share Units, your period of employment with Teradata shall not include any leave of absence, other than an approved leave of absence from which Teradata reasonably expects that you will return to perform services for Teradata. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the pro-rated number of Share Units within seventy (70) days after the end of the Performance Period.




	(b)    


	Change in Control


	.




	(i)    If a Change in Control occurs during the Performance Period, and this award is not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, then the Target Number of Share Units shall be credited to your Account, as of the date of the Change in Control, and the units shall be fully vested at that time. If such Change in Control constitutes a “change in control event” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(i)(5), the Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the Target Number of Share Units within 30 days after such Change in Control. If such Change in Control does not constitute a “change in control event” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(i)(5), the Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the Target Number of Share Units within seventy (70) days after the earlier of (A) the applicable Payment Dates (in accordance with the payment schedule of Section 2(c) of this








	2








	Exhibit 10.10.29








	Agreement) or (B) your termination of employment (subject to Section 4 of this Agreement), except that if your termination of employment occurs during the Performance Period, the Company shall deliver such Shares within seventy (70) days after the end of the Performance Period.




	(ii)    If a Change in Control occurs during the Performance Period and this award is assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, then the Target Number of Share Units shall be credited to your Account, as of the date of the Change in Control, and the Share Units shall continue to vest in accordance with Section 2(a); provided, however, that if you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason other than a termination of your employment by Teradata for Cause, then any Share Units credited to your Account that have not yet vested shall vest in full upon such termination. The Company shall deliver the Target Number of Share Units credited to your Account in accordance with this Section 3(b)(ii) within seventy (70) days after the earlier of (A) the applicable Payment Dates (in accordance with the payment schedule of Section 2(c) of this Agreement) or (B) your termination of employment (subject to Section 4 of this Agreement), except that if your termination of employment occurs during the Performance Period, the Company shall deliver such Shares within seventy (70) days after the end of the Performance Period.




	4.    


	Section 409A Compliance


	. The intent of the parties is that payments under this Agreement comply with Section 409A or are exempt therefrom and this Agreement shall be interpreted, administered and governed in accordance with such intent.




	(a)    


	Termination of Employment


	. To the extent that you are a U.S. taxpayer, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of Shares subject to Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A and you are no longer providing services (at a level that would preclude the occurrence of a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A) to Teradata as an employee or consultant, and for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.




	(b)    


	Payment Delay for Specified Employees


	. If you are a “specified employee,” as determined under the Company’s policy for identifying specified employees on the date of termination, then to the extent required in order to comply with Section 409A, all payments made under this Agreement that constitute a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A that are provided as a result of a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A for any reason other than your death and that would otherwise be paid or provided during the first six months following such separation from service shall be accumulated through and paid within 30 days after the first business day that is more than six months after the date of your separation from service (or, if you die during such six-month period, within 30 days after your death).




	(c)    


	Acceleration of Payment


	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Committee shall have the right, at any time in its sole discretion, to accelerate the time of a payment under this Agreement to a time otherwise permitted under Section 409A in accordance with the requirements, restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j).

	5.     


	Confidentiality


	. By accepting this award, unless disclosure is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, you agree to keep this Agreement confidential and not to disclose its contents to anyone except your attorney, your immediate family, or your financial consultant, provided such persons agree in advance to keep such information confidential and not disclose it to others. The Share Units will be forfeited if you violate the terms and conditions of this Section 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Teradata agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit you from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”) or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. You do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify Teradata that you have made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right you may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency.




	6.     


	Transferability


	. The Share Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated, except by beneficiary designation, will or by the laws of descent and distribution upon your death. Any purported transfer or encumbrance in violation of the provisions of this Section 6 shall be void, and the other party to any such purported transaction shall not obtain any rights to or interest in such Share Units.




	     7.     


	Dividend Equivalents


	. From and after the Crediting Date and until the earlier of (a) the time when the Share Units are paid in accordance with this Agreement or (b) the time when your rights in the Share Units are forfeited in accordance with Section 2(b) hereof, on the date that Teradata pays a cash dividend (if any) to holders of Shares generally, you shall receive additional Share Units equal to (x) the number of Share Units held by you as of the date of record for such dividend, provided that the record date occurs on or after the Crediting Date; multiplied by (y) the per Share cash dividend amount; divided by (z) the Fair Market Value per Share on the dividend payment date. The additional Share Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Share Units covered by this Agreement, including without limitation the forfeiture provisions of Section 2(b) of this Agreement.






	8.    


	Misconduct; Termination for Cause


	. The Share Units will be forfeited if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause or if the Committee determines that you engaged in misconduct in connection with your employment with Teradata. Further, if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause, then, to the extent demanded by the Committee in its sole discretion and permitted by applicable law, you shall (a) return to Teradata all Shares that you have not disposed of that have been acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of termination of your employment, and (b) with respect to any Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of termination of your employment and that you have disposed of, pay to Teradata in cash the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date acquired.




	9.     


	Withholding


	. Teradata has the right to deduct or cause to be deducted from, or collect or cause to be collected, with respect to the taxation of any Share Units, any federal, state,








	4








	Exhibit 10.10.29








	local, foreign or other taxes required by the laws of the United States or any other country to be withheld or paid with respect to the Share Units, and you or your legal representative or beneficiary will be required to pay any such amounts. By accepting this award, you consent and direct that, if you are paid through Teradata’s United States payroll system at the time the Share Units are settled, Teradata’s stock plan administrator will withhold or sell the number of Shares underlying the Share Units as Teradata, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to satisfy such withholding requirements; provided, however, that if Teradata is required to withhold any taxes prior to settlement of the Share Units, then you agree that Teradata may satisfy those withholding obligations by withholding cash from your compensation otherwise due to you or by any other action as it may deem necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation. In no event shall the Fair Market Value of the Shares of common stock to be surrendered pursuant to this Section 9 to satisfy applicable withholding taxes exceed the minimum amount of taxes required to be withheld or such other amount that will not result in a negative accounting impact. If you are paid through a non-United States Teradata payroll system, you agree that Teradata may satisfy any withholding obligations by withholding cash from your compensation otherwise due to you or by any other action as it may deem necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation. You acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all taxes and tax-related items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Teradata or the employer. You also agree that you solely are responsible for filing all relevant documentation that may be required of you in relation to this award or any tax-related items, such as but not limited to personal income tax returns or reporting statements in relation to the grant or vesting of this award or the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such award and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents.




	10.    


	Restrictive Covenants


	. As a recipient of this equity award, you recognize that you have access to highly confidential, proprietary and non-public information of Teradata and its customers, including strategic plans, customer lists, research and development plans, and other information not made available to the general public and from which Teradata derives value. For purposes of this Agreement, this information is defined as “Trade Secret Information.”




	To protect Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information, and in exchange for the Share Units, you agree that the following restrictions will apply during your employment with Teradata and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, for a period of twelve (12) months after the date that you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason (the “Termination Date”) (or if applicable law mandates a maximum time that is shorter than twelve months, then for a period of time equal to that shorter maximum period):




	(a) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Committee, render services directly or indirectly to, or become employed by, any Competing Organization of Teradata (as defined in this Section 10 below) to the extent such services or employment involves the development, manufacture, marketing, sale, advertising or servicing of any product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to, or competes with, a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, marketed, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and upon which you worked or in which you participated during the last twelve (12) months of your Teradata employment. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of and Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information to which you had access as an employee of Teradata).

	(b) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Committee, directly or indirectly recruit, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any exempt employee of Teradata to terminate his or her employment with or otherwise cease his or her relationship with Teradata. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the information you obtained while a Teradata employee regarding the skills, experience and knowledge of Teradata employees, which is Trade Secret Information, and Teradata’s investment in developing these employees).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 10(b) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.




	(c) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Committee, solicit the business of any firm or company with which you worked during the preceding twelve (12) months of employment at Teradata, if such firm or company was a customer of Teradata, by using Teradata Trade Secret Information. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the identity of Teradata customers, their needs, interests, strategic plans, etc., all of which is Trade Secret Information you acquired as a Teradata employee with access to such information).




	If you breach the terms of this Section 10, you agree that in addition to any liability you may have for damages arising from such breach, any unvested Share Units will be immediately forfeited, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay to Teradata the Fair Market Value of any Share Units that vested during the twelve (12) months prior to the Termination Date. Such Fair Market Value shall be determined as of each applicable Vesting Date.




	As used in this Section 10, “Competing Organization” means a person or organization which is engaged in or about to become engaged in research on or development, production, marketing, leasing, selling or servicing of a product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and is therefore a competitor of Teradata.

	Arbitration


	. By accepting this award, you agree that, where permitted by local law, any controversy or claim arising out of or related to your employment relationship with Teradata shall be resolved by first exhausting any Teradata internal dispute resolution process and policy, and then by arbitration pursuant to such policy. If you are employed outside the United States, where permitted by local law, the arbitration shall be conducted in the regional headquarters city of the business unit in which you work. The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator who is an attorney knowledgeable in employment law. The arbitrator’s decision and award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. For arbitrations held in the United States, issues of arbitrability shall be determined in accordance with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; all other aspects shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state in which the headquarters of Teradata is located. Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees associated with the arbitration and other costs and expenses of the arbitration shall








	6








	Exhibit 10.10.29








	be borne as provided by the rules of the American Arbitration Association for an arbitration held in the United States, or similar applicable rules for an arbitration held outside the United States.




	Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, you acknowledge that if you breach Section 10, Teradata will sustain irreparable injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law. As a result, you agree that in the event of your breach of Section 10 Teradata may, in addition to any other remedies available to it, bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable relief to preserve the status quo pending appointment of an arbitrator and completion of an arbitration. You stipulate to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in the location from which Teradata’s equity programs are administered, for any such proceedings.




	12.

In the event of your death, any Share Units distributable hereunder that are subject to such a designation will be distributed to such beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with this Agreement. Any other Share Units not designated by you will be distributable to your estate. If there is any question as to the legal right of any beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder, the Share Units in question may be transferred to your estate, in which event Teradata will have no further liability to anyone with respect to such Share Units.




	(b)    The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, your successors, administrators, heirs, legal representatives and assigns, and the successors and assigns of the Company.




	14.     


	Severability


	. The provisions of this Agreement are severable. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction (including an arbitration tribunal), it shall be severed and shall not affect any other part of this Agreement, which will be enforced as permitted by law.

	18.    


	Dividend; Voting Rights


	. You shall not possess any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in the Shares underlying the Share Units credited to your Account until such Shares have been delivered to you in accordance with this Agreement. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement will be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Company to deliver Shares in the future, and your rights will be no greater than that of an unsecured general creditor. No assets of the Company will be held or set aside as security for the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.




	19.

Moreover, you understand and agree that the Company is neither responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar (or the selection by Teradata or the employer in its sole discretion of an applicable foreign currency exchange rate) that may affect the value of this award (or the calculation of income or any Tax-Related Items thereunder)




	nor liable for any decrease in the value of Shares or this award. In addition, the ownership of Shares or assets and holding of bank or brokerage account abroad may subject you to reporting requirements imposed by tax, banking, and/or other authorities in your country, and you understand and agree that you solely are responsible for complying with such requirements.

	(i)     “Relative TSR” means the percentile ranking of Teradata’s TSR relative to the TSR of the other companies included in the S&P Composite 1500 Information Technology Index for the entirety of the Performance Period (the “Peer Companies”). Relative TSR will be determined by ranking Teradata and the Peer Companies from highest to lowest according to their respective TSRs. After this ranking, the percentile performance of Teradata relative to the Peer Companies will be determined as follows:






	P =     


	N – R







	        N – 1




	where:    “P” represents the percentile performance which will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole percentile by application of regular rounding.




	“N” represents the remaining number of Peer Companies, plus Teradata.




	“R” represents Teradata’s ranking among the Peer Companies.




	Example:


	If there are 239 Peer Companies, and Teradata ranked 67



	th



	, the performance would be at the 72



	nd



	 percentile: .72 = (240 – 67)/(240 – 1)




	(ii)    “TSR” means, with respect to any company, the percentage growth in total stockholder return, determined by dividing (A) the appreciation in price of a share of the company’s common stock from the Opening Value (as defined below) to the Closing








	1








	Exhibit 10.10.30








	Value (as defined below), plus any dividends paid during the Performance Period (which shall be deemed reinvested in the company’s common stock on the ex-dividend date), by (B) the Opening Value;




	(iii)    “Opening Value” means, with respect to any company, the average of the closing prices per share of the company’s common stock for all trading days in the 90 calendar day period ending on and including December 31, 2016, assuming any dividends paid during the 90 calendar day period are reinvested in the company’s common stock on the ex-dividend date; and




	(iv)    “Closing Value” means, with respect to any company, the average of the closing prices per share of the company’s common stock for all trading days in the 90 calendar day period ending on and including the last day of the Performance Period, assuming any dividends paid during the 90 calendar day period are reinvested in the company’s common stock on the ex-dividend date.




	(b)    


	Additional Limitations


	. The number of Share Units (if any) credited to your account under the Agreement will be determined in accordance with the Performance Matrix; provided, however, that (i) if Teradata’s (absolute) TSR for the Performance Period is negative, then the number of Share Units credited to your account under the Agreement will not exceed the Target Number of Share Units; and (ii) in no event will the value of the Share Units credited to your account hereunder, determined based on the closing price per Share on December 31, 2019 (or, if applicable, the date immediately prior to a Change in Control described in Section 2(c) below), exceed four (4) times the value of the Target Number of Share Units determined based on the closing price on the Date of Grant (as adjusted by the Compensation and Human Resource Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Committee”) in the event of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization or similar transaction after the Date of Grant and during the Performance Period). An illustration of the limitation imposed by clause (ii) of this Section 1(b) is provided in Exhibit B.




	(c)     


	Crediting to Account


	. After the end of the Performance Period, the Committee shall determine in writing Teradata’s (absolute) TSR and Relative TSR for the Performance Period and the number of Share Units (if any) earned in accordance with this Agreement, which Share Units shall be credited to a book entry account established on your behalf (the “Account”). Each Share Unit credited to your Account under this Section 1(b) shall represent the contingent right to receive one Share and shall at all times be equal in value to one Share.




	(d)    


	Forfeiture of Share Units


	. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2, your right to receive a credit of Share Units shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice in the event that Teradata’s Relative TSR for the Performance Period is below the threshold level specified in the Performance Matrix.




	2.     


	Vesting, Forfeiture and Payment of Share Units


	.




	(a)    


	Vesting


	. Provided that you are continuously employed by Teradata through December 31, 2017, the Share Units (if any) credited to your Account in accordance with Section

	Exhibit 10.10.30








	1 above shall be fully vested, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 2(c) or Section 3 of this Agreement, the Company will deliver the Shares underlying the vested Share Units within seventy (70) days after December 31, 2019.




	(b)    


	Certain Terminations


	.




	(i)    If during the first year of the Performance Period (fiscal 2017) and prior to a Change in Control you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason other than a termination of your employment by Teradata for Cause, then the Company shall credit to your Account a pro-rated number of Share Units, which shall be fully vested, and which shall be calculated by multiplying (i) the actual number of Share Units (if any) that would have been credited to your Account in accordance with Section 1 of this Agreement had you continued in employment through December 31, 2017, determined by the Committee based on the actual performance of the Company during the entire Performance Period, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months of employment you completed commencing with January 1, 2017, and the denominator of which is 12 months (subject to such rounding conventions as may be implemented from time-to-time by Teradata’s third party Plan administrator). For purposes of determining any pro rata vesting of your Share Units, your period of employment with Teradata shall not include any leave of absence, other than an approved leave of absence from which Teradata reasonably expects that you will return to perform services for Teradata. The Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the pro-rated number of Share Units (if any) that become vested pursuant to this Section 2(b) within seventy (70) days after December 31, 2019.




	(ii)    If during the second or third year of the Performance Period (fiscal 2018 or 2019) and prior to a Change in Control you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason other than a termination of your employment by Teradata for Cause, then, following the completion of the full Performance Period, the Company shall credit to your Account the number of Share Units earned pursuant to this Agreement, determined by the Committee based on the actual performance of the Company during the entire Performance Period, which Share Units shall be fully vested (without pro-ration). The Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the number of Share Units (if any) that become vested pursuant to this Section 2(b) within seventy (70) days after December 31, 2019.




	(c)    


	Change in Control


	.




	(i)    If a Change in Control occurs prior to December 31, 2019 and this award is not assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, then the Company shall credit to your Account, as of the date of the Change in Control, a number of fully vested Share Units determined as follows: (A) if the Change in Control occurs during 2017, the number of fully vested Share Units credited to your Account hereunder shall be the Target Number of Share Units, and (B) if the Change in Control occurs during 2018 or 2019, the number of fully vested Share Units credited to your Account hereunder shall be determined based on the actual performance of the Company during the period commencing January 1, 2017 and ending immediately prior to the Change in Control (which period shall be treated as the “Performance Period” for all purposes under this Agreement). If such Change in Control constitutes a “change in control event” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(i)(5), the Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying








	3








	Exhibit 10.10.30








	the vested Share Units credited to your Account within 30 days after such Change in Control. If such Change in Control does not constitute a “change in control event” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-3(i)(5), the Company shall deliver to you the Shares underlying the vested Share Units credited to your Account within seventy (70) days after the earlier of (A) December 31, 2019, or (B) your termination of employment (except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Agreement).




	(ii)    If a Change in Control occurs prior to December 31, 2019 and this award is assumed, converted or replaced by the continuing entity, then the Company shall credit to your Account, as of the date of the Change in Control, a number of Share Units determined as follows: (A) if the Change in Control occurs during 2017, the number of Share Units credited to your Account hereunder shall be the Target Number of Share Units, and (B) if the Change in Control occurs during 2018 or 2019, the number of Share Units credited to your Account hereunder shall be determined based on the actual performance of the Company during the period commencing January 1, 2017 and ending immediately prior to the Change in Control (which period shall be treated as the “Performance Period” for all purposes under this Agreement). Any Share Units credited to your Account in accordance with this Section 2(c)(ii) shall continue to vest based solely upon your continued employment in accordance with Section 2(a); provided, however, that if you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason other than a termination of your employment by Teradata for Cause, then any Share Units credited to your Account in accordance with this Section 2(c)(ii) that have not yet vested shall vest in full upon such termination. If the Share Units credited to your Account in accordance with this Section 2(c)(ii) become vested by reason of a termination of your employment, then, except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver the Shares underlying the vested Share Units credited to your Account within seventy (70) days after the earlier of (x) December 31, 2019, or (y) your termination of employment.




	(d)     


	Forfeiture


	. Except as otherwise provided above, your right to receive a credit of Share Units shall be forfeited automatically without further action or notice in the event that you cease to be continuously employed by Teradata through December 31, 2017.




	3.    


	Section 409A Compliance


	. The intent of the parties is that payments under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code or are exempt therefrom and this Agreement shall be interpreted, administered and governed in accordance with such intent.




	(a)    


	Termination of Employment


	. To the extent that you are a U.S. taxpayer, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of Shares subject to Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A and you are no longer providing services (at a level that would preclude the occurrence of a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A) to Teradata as an employee or consultant, and for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A.




	(b)    


	Payment Delay for Specified Employees


	. If you are a “specified employee,” as determined under the Company’s policy for identifying specified employees on the date of








	4








	Exhibit 10.10.30








	termination, then to the extent required in order to comply with Section 409A, all payments made under this Agreement that constitute a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A that are provided as a result of a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A for any reason other than your death and that would otherwise be paid or provided during the first six months following such separation from service shall be accumulated through and paid within 30 days after the first business day that is more than six months after the date of your separation from service (or, if you die during such six-month period, within 30 days after your death).




	(c)    


	Acceleration of Payment


	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Committee shall have the right, at any time in its sole discretion, to accelerate the time of a payment under this Agreement to a time otherwise permitted under Section 409A in accordance with the requirements, restrictions and limitations of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j).




	4.     


	Confidentiality


	. By accepting this award, unless disclosure is required or permitted by applicable law or regulation, you agree to keep this Agreement confidential and not to disclose its contents to anyone except your attorney, your immediate family, or your financial consultant, provided such persons agree in advance to keep such information confidential and not disclose it to others. The Share Units will be forfeited if you violate the terms and conditions of this Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Teradata agreement, policy, practice, procedure, directive or instruction shall prohibit you from reporting possible violations of federal, state or local laws or regulations to any federal, state or local governmental agency or commission (a “Government Agency”) or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state or local laws or regulations. You do not need prior authorization of any kind to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify Teradata that you have made such reports or disclosures. Nothing in this Agreement limits any right you may have to receive a whistleblower award or bounty for information provided to any Government Agency.




	5.     


	Transferability


	. The Share Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated, except by beneficiary designation, will or by the laws of descent and distribution upon your death. Any purported transfer or encumbrance in violation of the provisions of this Section 5 shall be void, and the other party to any such purported transaction shall not obtain any rights to or interest in such Share Units.




	     6.     


	Dividend Equivalents


	. From and after the date that any vested Share Units are credited to your Account pursuant to Section 1 hereof (the “Crediting Date”) and until the time when the Share Units are paid in accordance with this Agreement, on the date that Teradata pays a cash dividend (if any) to holders of Shares generally, you shall receive additional Share Units equal to (x) the number of Share Units held by you as of the date of record for such dividend, provided that the record date occurs on or after the Crediting Date; multiplied by (y) the per Share cash dividend amount; divided by (z) the Fair Market Value per Share on the dividend payment date. The additional Share Units shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Share Units covered by this Agreement, including without limitation the forfeiture and repayment provisions of Sections 7 and 11 of this Agreement.








	5








	Exhibit 10.10.30










	7.    


	Misconduct; Termination for Cause


	. The Share Units will be forfeited if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause or if the Committee determines that you engaged in misconduct in connection with your employment with Teradata. Further, if your employment is terminated by Teradata for Cause, then, to the extent demanded by the Committee in its sole discretion and permitted by applicable law, you shall (a) return to Teradata all Shares that you have not disposed of that have been acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of termination of your employment, and (b) with respect to any Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement during the twelve (12) months prior to the date of termination of your employment and that you have disposed of, pay to Teradata in cash the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the date acquired.




	8.     


	Withholding


	. Teradata has the right to deduct or cause to be deducted from, or collect or cause to be collected, with respect to the taxation of any Share Units, any federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes required by the laws of the United States or any other country to be withheld or paid with respect to the Share Units, and you or your legal representative or beneficiary will be required to pay any such amounts. By accepting this award, you consent and direct that, if you are paid through Teradata’s United States payroll system at the time the Share Units are settled, Teradata’s stock plan administrator will withhold or sell the number of Shares underlying the Share Units as Teradata, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to satisfy such withholding requirements; provided, however, that if Teradata is required to withhold any taxes prior to settlement of the Share Units, then you agree that Teradata may satisfy those withholding obligations by withholding cash from your compensation otherwise due to you or by any other action as it may deem necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation. If you are paid through a non-United States Teradata payroll system, you agree that Teradata may satisfy any withholding obligations by withholding cash from your compensation otherwise due to you or by any other action as it may deem necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation. The value of any Shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding requirements hereunder will not exceed the minimum amount of taxes required to be withheld or such other amount that will not result in a negative accounting impact. You acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all taxes and tax-related items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by Teradata or the employer. You also agree that you solely are responsible for filing all relevant documentation that may be required of you in relation to this award or any tax-related items, such as but not limited to personal income tax returns or reporting statements in relation to the grant or vesting of this award or the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such award and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents.




	9.        


	Restrictive Covenants


	. As a recipient of this equity award, you recognize that you have access to highly confidential, proprietary and non-public information of Teradata and its customers, including strategic plans, customer lists, research and development plans, and other information not made available to the general public and from which Teradata derives value.

	To protect Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information, and in exchange for the Share Units, you agree that the following restrictions will apply during your employment with Teradata and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, for a period of twelve (12) months after the date that you cease to be employed by Teradata for any reason (the “Termination Date”) (or if applicable law

(This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of and Teradata’s investment in Trade Secret Information to which you had access as an employee of Teradata).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9(a) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.











	(b) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Committee, directly or indirectly recruit, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to induce, any exempt employee of Teradata to terminate his or her employment with or otherwise cease his or her relationship with Teradata. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the information you obtained while a Teradata employee regarding the skills, experience and knowledge of Teradata employees, which is Trade Secret Information, and Teradata’s investment in developing these employees).


	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9(b) SHALL NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED BY TERADATA IN CALIFORNIA.









	(c) You will not, without the prior written consent of the Committee, solicit the business of any firm or company with which you worked during the preceding twelve (12) months of employment at Teradata, if such firm or company was a customer of Teradata, by using Teradata Trade Secret Information. (This restriction is specifically intended to protect the value of the identity of Teradata customers, their needs, interests, strategic plans, etc., all of which is Trade Secret Information you acquired as a Teradata employee with access to such information).









	If you breach the terms of this Section 9, you agree that in addition to any liability you may have for damages arising from such breach, any unvested Share Units will be immediately forfeited, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to pay to Teradata the Fair Market Value of any Share Units that vested during the twelve (12) months prior to the Termination Date. Such Fair Market Value shall be determined as of the applicable vesting date of the Share Units.









	As used in this Section 9, “Competing Organization” means a person or organization which is engaged in or about to become engaged in research on or development, production, marketing, leasing, selling or servicing of a product, process, system or service which is the same or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service manufactured, sold, serviced or otherwise provided by Teradata to its customers and is therefore a competitor of Teradata.

	Arbitration


	. By accepting this award, you agree that, where permitted by local law, any controversy or claim arising out of or related to your employment relationship with Teradata shall be resolved by first exhausting any Teradata internal dispute resolution process and policy, and then by arbitration pursuant to such policy. If you are employed outside the United States, where permitted by local law, the arbitration shall be conducted in the regional headquarters city of the business unit in which you work. The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator who is an attorney knowledgeable in employment law. The arbitrator’s decision and award shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. For arbitrations held in the United States, issues of arbitrability shall be determined in accordance with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; all other aspects shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state in which the headquarters of Teradata is located. Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees associated with the arbitration and other costs and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne as provided by the rules of the American Arbitration Association for an arbitration held in the United States, or similar applicable rules for an arbitration held outside the United States.









	Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, you acknowledge that if you breach Section 9, Teradata will sustain irreparable injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law. As a result, you agree that in the event of your breach of Section 9 Teradata may, in addition to any other remedies available to it, bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable relief to preserve the status quo pending appointment of an arbitrator and completion of an arbitration. You stipulate to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in the location from which Teradata’s equity programs are administered, for any such proceedings.

Any other Share Units not designated by you will be distributable to your estate. If there is any question as to the legal right of any beneficiary to receive a distribution hereunder, the Share Units in question may be transferred to your estate, in which event Teradata will have no further liability to anyone with respect to such Share Units.

	Exhibit 10.10.30








	(b)    The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, your successors, administrators, heirs, legal representatives and assigns, and the successors and assigns of the Company.

	Dividend; Voting Rights


	. You shall not possess any incidents of ownership (including, without limitation, dividend and voting rights) in the Shares underlying the Share Units credited to your Account until such Shares have been delivered to you in accordance with this Agreement. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement will be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Company to deliver Shares in the future, and your rights will be no greater than that of an unsecured general creditor. No assets of the Company will be held or set aside as security for the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.




	18.    


	No Employment Contract or Acquired Rights


	. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon you any right with respect to continuance of employment by Teradata, nor limit or affect in any manner the right of Teradata to terminate your employment or adjust your compensation.

	You also understand and agree that any cross-border cash remittance made in relation to this award, including the transfer of proceeds received upon the sale of Shares, must be made through a locally authorized financial institution or registered foreign exchange agency and may require you to provide to such financial institution or agency certain information regarding the transaction. Moreover, you understand and agree that the Company is neither responsible for any foreign exchange fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar (or the selection by Teradata or the employer in its sole discretion of an applicable foreign currency exchange rate) that may affect the value of this award (or the calculation of income or any Tax-Related Items thereunder)




	nor liable for any decrease in the value of Shares or this award. In addition, the ownership of Shares or assets and holding of bank or brokerage account abroad may subject you to reporting requirements imposed by tax, banking, and/or other authorities in your country, and you understand and agree that you solely are responsible for complying with such requirements.

	. You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other Share Unit grant materials by and among, as applicable, the employer and Teradata for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ("MD&A")  You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"). This Annual Report contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the MD&A are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report. See "Risk Factors" and "Forward-looking Statements."   more accurately forecasting consumer demand, and   creating more predictable and less costly supply chains.  Our consulting services allow customers to maximize use and obtain great value from their analytics investments. Our services include a broad range of offerings including consulting to help organizations design, optimize and manage their analytic and big data environments, either on-premises or in the cloud. Our value-added consulting services provide expertise in data architecture services, cloud ("software as a service", "analytics as a service"), private cloud, managed services, and related installation services. In addition to our consulting services we offer a comprehensive set of support services. We serve customers around the world across a broad set of industries, including communications, ecommerce, financial services, government, gaming, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, media and entertainment, oil and gas, retail, travel and transportation, and utilities - with offerings ranging from small departmental implementations to many of the world's largest analytic data platforms. To meet evolving trends in information management, we provide our offerings on-premises or in the cloud (as a service).   Gross margin was 51.2% in 2016, up from 50.4% in 2015, which was largely due to improved deal mix and product mix.   Operating income was $232 million in 2016, up from operating loss of $(195) million in 2015. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to more significant impairments of goodwill and acquired intangibles in 2015 than 2016, as well as a decrease in operating expenses.   Net income of $125 million in 2016 versus a net loss of $(214) million in 2015. Net income per diluted share was $0.95 in 2016 compared to net loss per common share of $(1.53) in 2015. Net income for 2016 includes a $70 million after-tax impairment loss for goodwill and acquired intangibles, approximately $47 million in after-tax impacts of acquisition-related transaction, integration and reorganization expenses, and amortization of acquired intangible assets, compared to $502 million of such costs and expenses in 2015.  Table of Contents  STRATEGIC OVERVIEW   Business Analytics Solutions: deliver high-value business outcomes realized by engaging with business users through solution-based selling that leverages analytic consulting and repeatable analytical intellectual property ("IP");   Ecosystem Architecture Consulting: best-in-class architecture consulting expertise to help customers build optimized analytical ecosystems independent of technology, leveraging both open source and commercial solutions; and  We deliver our solutions on-premises, via the cloud, and "as a service"; offering customers choice in how they deploy a Teradata analytics environment and leverage the power of our solutions. These flexible delivery options are designed to extend our market opportunity.   by focusing on companies with the largest analytic opportunities,   by offering market-leading hybrid cloud technology,   that is enabled by a world class go-to-market sales and support team,   with the ultimate goal of generating revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth.  FUTURE TRENDS  We believe that future demand for our analytic solutions will increase based on the growth of new, high volume data sources such as sensor and machine-generated data, and based on data and analytics enabled use cases in areas such as seismic/exploration, genomics and biological research, connected cars, and smart cities.  Analytic environments are becoming more complex to design and manage as there are increasing types of analytic tools and techniques, multiple data management systems both on-premises and in the cloud, commercial and open source technologies to be integrated, varying service level requirements, and the growth and volume of data. This  Table of Contents  complexity drives the need for an overall architecture to manage such environments. Demand for value-added consulting and services is growing as customers seek help with evolving their analytic architectures, rapidly deploying their analytic architectural solutions, and increasingly look to purchase analytic capabilities "as a service".  Overall, analytics are growing in importance as global businesses seek new means to drive business value from the ever-increasing amounts and types of data. As a result, we expect that Teradata's leadership status and investments in our strategic areas of focus will position us for future growth.  This growth, however, is not expected to be without its challenges from general economic conditions, competitive pressures, alternative technologies, and other risks and uncertainties. Over the past few years, we have seen a shift in the market that included a reduction in customers' large capital investments in traditional data analytic systems and related services. Specifically, customers have been focusing investments in their analytical ecosystems on products which have lower average selling prices than traditional integrated data warehouse ("IDW") environments, and changing their buying behavior with decisions shifting from IT to business users who typically want operating expense purchasing options. As a result, our revenue has been impacted by our customers' focus on less capital intensive options like cloud, subscription-based licenses, rental and usage-based models. In addition, an increasing percentage of our customers want to buy easy-to-use, vendor managed, on-line delivery "as-a-service" analytics rather than analytic systems. Currently, we believe that the greatest challenge for future revenue growth relates to our ability to adapt and respond to this market shift with respect to the way customers want to purchase and deploy analytic technologies.  Overall, we believe that the IDW will remain a critical part of companies' analytical ecosystems and Teradata's technology is highly differentiated with our ability to handle the concurrency and service level agreements of hundreds to thousands of mission-critical users and applications. Further, we believe the Company has the opportunity for continued revenue growth from both the expansion of our existing customers' analytical ecosystems as well as the addition of new customers. Teradata has expanded our offerings as well as our pricing options to make it easier for customers to buy and expand with Teradata including flexible offerings including availability in the cloud and over time pricing programs.  There is risk that pricing and competitive pressures on our solutions could increase in the future as major customers evaluate and rationalize their analytics infrastructure, particularly to the extent that cost becomes the top focus and lower-cost/lower performing alternatives are more seriously and frequently considered. However, such alternatives generally do not enable companies to perform mission-critical, complex analytic workloads to address customer's needed business outcomes from large-scale analytics, discovery analytics, and data management such as those enabled by Teradata's portfolio of offerings. As the market continues to evolve, we will be challenged to generate revenue growth shorter term as customers purchase in smaller deal sizes, and more of our customers shift from upfront perpetual licenses to over time models at a pace which is difficult to predict.  As described above, we are also transforming our go-to-market approach to better position Teradata with both business buyers and IT buyers, and to expand with our existing customers as well as add more customers. To meet this objective, we will focus on execution and monitoring our progress with respect to this evolution, as well as working to infuse talent into our organization with key skill sets to support our strategy. We continue to believe that analytics will remain a high priority for companies and longer term will drive growth for Teradata's leading solutions. Moreover, we continue to be committed to new product development and achieving a positive yield from our research and development spending and resources, which are intended to drive future demand. In addition, we will continue to optimize our go-to-market structure to focus on the greatest analytic opportunities, and to manage our cost structure as we work to broaden our product and consulting services portfolios and market penetration.  As a portion of the Company's operations and revenue occur outside the United States ("U.S."), and in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Based on currency rates as of January 31, 2017, Teradata is expecting one point of negative impact from currency translation on our full year projected revenue growth rate.  Table of Contents  BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION   On-premises data warehouse - We have introduced methods to make it easier to buy, expand, and seamlessly upgrade data warehouses. We expect that our IntelliFlex platform architecture, released in early 2016, will provide more flexible configurations and seamless expansions of our customers' IDW environments, and that the software-only version of our Teradata database will allow us to expand with both new and existing customers.   Analytical ecosystem - We are adding to our data load and integration software and service offerings capabilities that manage customers' analytical ecosystems with new products such as Teradata UnityTM, QueryGridTM, and ListenerTM. These offerings help connect and manage the customers' ecosystems to help manage and extract value from their data.  We expect the mix of our revenues to shift toward cloud, analytical ecosystem, and analytic consulting services over time, as these are faster growing markets, which we believe will help increase our recurring revenue over time. Another element that is critical to Teradata's successful transformation plan is modifying our go-to-market efforts to a more consultative approach to better address the increasing relevance of business buyers and to help customers build analytical ecosystems that include our own technologies as well as open source and other commercial solutions. We have actions underway to adjust our go-to-market efforts to address these new approaches and to align with the way we believe that our customers want to buy data analytics solutions. We have reviewed and rationalized the Company's expense structure and are now moving from a cost reduction initiative to a cost management approach as we invest for Teradata's future, including investments to support our cloud-based initiatives, analytical solutions, realignment of our go-to-market approach, and modernizing our infrastructure.  Table of Contents   Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) - is the annual value at a point in time of all of our recurring contracts, including support, software upgrade rights, subscription licenses, rental and cloud.   Recurring Revenue as a % of Total Revenue - revenue from all recurring contracts, including support, software upgrade rights, subscription licenses, rental and cloud divided by total Company revenue.   Business Consulting Revenue Growth - revenue growth from our strategic service offerings around Analytics Consulting, Business Consulting, and Ecosystem Architecture consulting. Although the revenue from Business Consulting represents a small percent of total Company revenue, it is a leading indicator of future TCORE growth and measures our effectiveness of becoming a "Trusted Advisor" within our customers and targeted prospects.  RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014 Revenue % of % of % of In millions 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue 2014 Revenue Product revenue $ 889 38.3 % $ 1,057 41.8 % $ 1,227 44.9 % Service revenue 1,433 61.7 % 1,473 58.2 % 1,505 55.1 % Total revenue $ 2,322 100 % $ 2,530 100 % $ 2,732 100 %  Total revenue decreased 8% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The revenue decrease included a 1% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The revenue decline was primarily due to customers increasingly opting for subscription-based (term) licenses, rental of hardware, and cloud adoption. This has an impact on the amount of revenue that is booked upfront versus over the term of the contract. In addition, the sale of the marketing applications business, which generated $69 million in revenue in 2016 (before the sale on July 1, 2016) compared to $153 million in 2015, had a negative impact on total revenue of 3%. Product revenue decreased 16% in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to customers increasingly opting for our subscription-based purchase options. Service revenue decreased 3% in 2016 from 2015, with an underlying 6% decrease in consulting services revenue and 1% increase in maintenance services revenue compared to 2015. Services revenue declined primarily due to the sale of the marketing applications business on July 1, 2016 and foreign currency fluctuations, which had a 2% adverse impact on services revenue.   Services Mix - The proportion of higher-margin maintenance revenue versus lower-margin consulting revenue that generates the total services revenue of the Company.   Product Mix - The proportion of various products that generate the total product revenue of the Company. For example, a higher mix of IDW products versus departmental data mart, Aster, our Extreme Data  Table of Contents  Appliance or Hadoop products would have a positive impact on product gross margins. This definition also includes the mix of Company sourced and third party products.   COD is a common offering used by Teradata and other information technology vendors that allows the customer to purchase extra capacity in the future, which is already delivered and integrated into their existing systems, typically within 12-18 months. COD enables customers to "activate" or add capacity quickly. Product cost is recognized upon delivery with no corresponding revenue. When customers activate the COD, we record and recognize the revenue associated with the added capacity and the gross margin is recovered. Floor sweeps take place when an existing customer replaces their older Teradata platform with a new Teradata platform, which can result in a large revenue transaction, but typically also results in a higher mix of lower-margin hardware revenue versus higher-margin software revenue. ELA transactions allow customers to purchase as much software as needed for current production use for a period of time in exchange for a fixed fee that is typically recognized as revenue upfront or as payments become due if the terms of the payments are extended. Additional capacity during the term results in lower-margin hardware revenue versus higher-margin software revenue.  Gross margin for the following years ended December 31 was as follows:   % of % of % of In millions 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue 2014 Revenue Gross margin Product gross margin $ 537 60.4 % $ 617 58.4 % $ 784 63.9 % Service gross margin 651 45.4 % 659 44.7 % 695 46.2 % Total gross margin $ 1,188 51.2 % $ 1,276 50.4 % $ 1,479 54.1 %  In 2016, product margin increased 2% points due to favorable deal and product  Table of Contents  Operating Expenses % of % of % of In millions 2016 Revenue 2015 Revenue 2014 Revenue Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 664 28.6 % $ 765 30.2 % $ 770 28.2 % Research and development expenses 212 9.1 % 228 9.0 % 206 7.5 % Impairment of goodwill, acquired intangibles and other assets 80 3.4 % 478 18.9 % - - % Total operating expenses $ 956 41.2 % $ 1,471 58.1 % $ 976 35.7 %  In 2016, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense decreased by $101 million or 13% compared to 2015. The decrease is driven by the exit of the marketing applications business and cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by higher annual incentive payment accruals.

Teradata Corporation is a provider of database-related products and services. The company was formed in 1979 in Brentwood, California, as a collaboration between researchers at Caltech and Citibank's advanced technology group.[2] The company was acquired by NCR Corporation in 1991, and subsequently spun-off again as an independent public company on October 1, 2007.
The company produces a relational database management system of the same name, which it markets as a data warehouse. It also acquired new technologies by making many acquisitions. In 2015, after continued losses, the company announced a business transformation review, which led to divestitures and replacement of executives.[3] Teradata employed 10,093 at the end of 2016, and had corporate headquarters Dayton, Ohio.[1]

Corporate overview[edit]
Teradata is an enterprise software company that develops and sells a relational database management system (RDBMS) with the same name. Teradata is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the stock symbol TDC.[4]
The flagship Teradata product is referred to as a "data warehouse system" which stores and manages data. The data warehouses use a "shared nothing architecture", which means that each server node has its own memory and processing power.[5] Adding more servers and nodes increases the amount of data that can be stored. The database software runs on the servers and spreads the workload among them.[6] In 2010, Teradata added text analytics to track unstructured data, such as word processor documents, and semi-structured data, such as spreadsheets.[7]
Teradata has a supplier diversity program that designates a minimum of 3 to 5% of spending on minority, women, veteran, or small business vendors.[8] In 2013, the Ethisphere Institute named Teradata as one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies."[9]
Teradata holds an annual user group conference and expo known as Teradata Partners with keynote industry speakers, educational sessions led by customers and other vendors.[10] The Teradata Partners Conference has been an annual event since 1985.[11] The conference involves lectures and speeches on technical and business topics and announcements about new products.[12]
History[edit]




NCR Teradata Worldmark 5100 in 2002


The concept of Teradata grew from research at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and from the discussions of Citibank's advanced technology group in the 1970s.[13] The company was incorporated in 1979 in Brentwood, California by Jack E. Shemer, Philip M. Neches, Walter E. Muir, Jerold R. Modes, William P. Worth, Carroll Reed and David Hartke. In 1984 Teradata released its DBC/1012 specialized database computer.[14] [15] In 1990 it acquired Sharebase, originally named Britton Lee.[16]
In September 1991 AT&T Corporation acquired NCR Corporation,[17] which in December announced the acquisition of Teradata for about $250 million. Kenneth W. Simonds had been chief executive since 1986.[18] In 1992 Teradata built the first system over 1 terabyte, at Wal-Mart.[19] A Teradata database became the world's largest at 11 terabytes in 1992. By 1997 NCR became independent from AT&T.[17]
In 1999 NCR acquired Strategic Technologies & Systems, and appointed Stephen Brobst as chief technology officer of the Teradata Solutions Group. In April 2000 NCR acquired Ceres Integrated Solutions and its customer relationship management software for $90 million,[20] and in July Stirling Douglas Group and its demand chain management software.[21] In 2005, it acquired financial management software from DecisionPoint.[22]
In January 2007 NCR announced Teradata would become an independent public company, led by Michael F. Koehler.[23][24] The new company's shares started trading in October.[4] In March 2008 Teradata acquired professional services company Claraview, which previously had spun out software provider Clarabridge.[25]
In August 2010, Teradata acquired column-oriented DBMS vendor Kickfire.[26][27] In December it acquired marketing software company Aprimo for about $550 million.[28][29] In March 2011 it acquired Aster Data Systems for about $263 million.[30][31] In May 2012 Teradata acquired email direct marketing company eCircle, which was merged into the Aprimo business.[32]
In July, 2014, Teradata acquired the assets of Revelytix, a provider of information management products and for a reported $50 million, Hadapt, a company that developed the database management system Presto for Apache Hadoop,[33][34][35] and in September, Hadoop service firm Think Big Analytics.[36] In December, Teradata acquired RainStor, a company specializing in online data archiving on Hadoop.[37]
In January 2015 Teradata acquired Appoxxee, a mobile marketing software as a service provider, for about $20 million.[38] In September Teradata acquired digital marketing company FLXone, based in the Netherlands.[39] In November 2015, after continued losses and declining revenue, a business transformation review was announced.[3] The company terminated "co-president" Herman Wimmer in December 2015, although it later had to pay more than 4.2 million Euros and a company car as severance.[40]
In April, 2016, a product line called IntelliFlex was announced.[41] On May 5, 2016 Victor L. Lund, who had been an executive of American Stores from 1977 to 1999, became the chief executive.[42] In July 2016, the marketing applications division, using the Aprimo brand, was sold to private equity firm Marlin Equity Partners for about $90 million. This was hundreds of millions less than it paid making the acquisitions of several companies merged into the unit.[43][44] Marlin combined businesses of the former eCircle, Appoxee, and Ozone businesses with an email marketing company BlueHornet (that it had acquired in 2015), using the brand Mapp Digital in September 2016.[45]
On July 21, 2016, Teradata acquired Big Data Partnership, a service company based in the UK.[46]

Teradata Database 13.10 was announced in October 2010.[49][50] At the time, Teradata used Xeon 5600 processors for the server nodes.[51]
Teradata Database 14 was sold as the upgrade to 13.10 in 2011 and runs multiple data warehouse workloads at the same time.[52] It includes column-store analyses.[53]

The Teradata database includes a feature called QueryGrid, [60] that allows user of the Teradata database to fetch data from external databases from standard SQL queries, as if they were hosted in the local EDW. The data movement happens in parallel whenever possible, so it is as efficient as performance the external data source; this is usually still much slower than native Teradata database performance, but still acceptable for exploratory tasks. External data sources are Aster, Presto, Teradata, Hive and Oracle.
Platform family[edit]
Teradata Platform Family is a set of products that include the Teradata Data Warehouse, Database, and a set of analytic tools. The platform family is marketed as smaller and less expensive than the other Teradata products.[61]
Big data[edit]
Teradata began to market with the term “big data” in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to “new media sources, such as social media.”[62] The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the “Petabyte club” in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.[63]
The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology.[64] For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company’s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.[65]
Competition[edit]
Teradata's main competitors are similar products from vendors such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and Sybase IQ. Also, competitors include data warehouse appliance vendors such as Netezza[66] (acquired in November 2010 by IBM), DATAllegro (acquired in August 2008 by Microsoft), ParAccel (acquired in April 2013 by Actian in April 2013), Pivotal Greenplum Database (acquired in July 2010 by EMC Corporation in July 2010), and Vertica Systems (acquired in February 2011 by HP), and from packaged data warehouse applications such as SAP BW.
Teradata has also seen competition from Hadoop-based distributions and other open source technologies.

Teradata Corporation is a provider of database-related products and services. The company was formed in 1979 in Brentwood, California, as a collaboration between researchers at Caltech and Citibank's advanced technology group.[2] The company was acquired by NCR Corporation in 1991, and subsequently spun-off again as an independent public company on October 1, 2007.
The company produces a relational database management system of the same name, which it markets as a data warehouse. It also acquired new technologies by making many acquisitions. In 2015, after continued losses, the company announced a business transformation review, which led to divestitures and replacement of executives.[3] Teradata employed 10,093 at the end of 2016, and had corporate headquarters Dayton, Ohio.[1]

Corporate overview[edit]
Teradata is an enterprise software company that develops and sells a relational database management system (RDBMS) with the same name. Teradata is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the stock symbol TDC.[4]
The flagship Teradata product is referred to as a "data warehouse system" which stores and manages data. The data warehouses use a "shared nothing architecture", which means that each server node has its own memory and processing power.[5] Adding more servers and nodes increases the amount of data that can be stored. The database software runs on the servers and spreads the workload among them.[6] In 2010, Teradata added text analytics to track unstructured data, such as word processor documents, and semi-structured data, such as spreadsheets.[7]
Teradata has a supplier diversity program that designates a minimum of 3 to 5% of spending on minority, women, veteran, or small business vendors.[8] In 2013, the Ethisphere Institute named Teradata as one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies."[9]
Teradata holds an annual user group conference and expo known as Teradata Partners with keynote industry speakers, educational sessions led by customers and other vendors.[10] The Teradata Partners Conference has been an annual event since 1985.[11] The conference involves lectures and speeches on technical and business topics and announcements about new products.[12]
History[edit]




NCR Teradata Worldmark 5100 in 2002


The concept of Teradata grew from research at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and from the discussions of Citibank's advanced technology group in the 1970s.[13] The company was incorporated in 1979 in Brentwood, California by Jack E. Shemer, Philip M. Neches, Walter E. Muir, Jerold R. Modes, William P. Worth, Carroll Reed and David Hartke. In 1984 Teradata released its DBC/1012 specialized database computer.[14] [15] In 1990 it acquired Sharebase, originally named Britton Lee.[16]
In September 1991 AT&T Corporation acquired NCR Corporation,[17] which in December announced the acquisition of Teradata for about $250 million. Kenneth W. Simonds had been chief executive since 1986.[18] In 1992 Teradata built the first system over 1 terabyte, at Wal-Mart.[19] A Teradata database became the world's largest at 11 terabytes in 1992. By 1997 NCR became independent from AT&T.[17]
In 1999 NCR acquired Strategic Technologies & Systems, and appointed Stephen Brobst as chief technology officer of the Teradata Solutions Group. In April 2000 NCR acquired Ceres Integrated Solutions and its customer relationship management software for $90 million,[20] and in July Stirling Douglas Group and its demand chain management software.[21] In 2005, it acquired financial management software from DecisionPoint.[22]
In January 2007 NCR announced Teradata would become an independent public company, led by Michael F. Koehler.[23][24] The new company's shares started trading in October.[4] In March 2008 Teradata acquired professional services company Claraview, which previously had spun out software provider Clarabridge.[25]
In August 2010, Teradata acquired column-oriented DBMS vendor Kickfire.[26][27] In December it acquired marketing software company Aprimo for about $550 million.[28][29] In March 2011 it acquired Aster Data Systems for about $263 million.[30][31] In May 2012 Teradata acquired email direct marketing company eCircle, which was merged into the Aprimo business.[32]
In July, 2014, Teradata acquired the assets of Revelytix, a provider of information management products and for a reported $50 million, Hadapt, a company that developed the database management system Presto for Apache Hadoop,[33][34][35] and in September, Hadoop service firm Think Big Analytics.[36] In December, Teradata acquired RainStor, a company specializing in online data archiving on Hadoop.[37]
In January 2015 Teradata acquired Appoxxee, a mobile marketing software as a service provider, for about $20 million.[38] In September Teradata acquired digital marketing company FLXone, based in the Netherlands.[39] In November 2015, after continued losses and declining revenue, a business transformation review was announced.[3] The company terminated "co-president" Herman Wimmer in December 2015, although it later had to pay more than 4.2 million Euros and a company car as severance.[40]
In April, 2016, a product line called IntelliFlex was announced.[41] On May 5, 2016 Victor L. Lund, who had been an executive of American Stores from 1977 to 1999, became the chief executive.[42] In July 2016, the marketing applications division, using the Aprimo brand, was sold to private equity firm Marlin Equity Partners for about $90 million. This was hundreds of millions less than it paid making the acquisitions of several companies merged into the unit.[43][44] Marlin combined businesses of the former eCircle, Appoxee, and Ozone businesses with an email marketing company BlueHornet (that it had acquired in 2015), using the brand Mapp Digital in September 2016.[45]
On July 21, 2016, Teradata acquired Big Data Partnership, a service company based in the UK.[46]
Technology and products[edit]
See also: Teradata Geospatial, Teradata Warehouse Miner, and Teradata Parallel Transporter
Active enterprise data warehouse[edit]
Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse, often called Teradata Database, includes data management tools and data mining software. Teradata's product can be used for business analysis. Data warehouses can track company data, such as sales, customer preferences, product placement, etc.[6] The data warehouse differentiates between “hot and cold” data – meaning that the warehouse puts data that is not often used in a slower storage section.[47] The original system used a proprietary network technology called BYNet.[48]
Teradata Database 13.10 was announced in October 2010.[49][50] At the time, Teradata used Xeon 5600 processors for the server nodes.[51]
Teradata Database 14 was sold as the upgrade to 13.10 in 2011 and runs multiple data warehouse workloads at the same time.[52] It includes column-store analyses.[53]
Teradata Integrated Analytics[54] is a set of tools for data analysis that resides inside the data warehouse.[55]
Teradata Warehouse Miner provides and interface for data mining on Microsoft Windows. It was released before 2003.[56]
Aster Platform[edit]
The Aster Platform is Teradata's analytic technology, acquired from Aster Data Systems.[57]
Backup, archive, and restore[edit]
BAR is Teradata’s backup and recovery system.[58]
The Teradata Disaster Recovery Solution is automation and tools for data recovery and archiving. Customer data can be stored in an offsite recovery center.[59]
QueryGrid[edit]
The Teradata database includes a feature called QueryGrid, [60] that allows user of the Teradata database to fetch data from external databases from standard SQL queries, as if they were hosted in the local EDW. The data movement happens in parallel whenever possible, so it is as efficient as performance the external data source; this is usually still much slower than native Teradata database performance, but still acceptable for exploratory tasks. External data sources are Aster, Presto, Teradata, Hive and Oracle.
Platform family[edit]
Teradata Platform Family is a set of products that include the Teradata Data Warehouse, Database, and a set of analytic tools. The platform family is marketed as smaller and less expensive than the other Teradata products.[61]
Big data[edit]
Teradata began to market with the term “big data” in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to “new media sources, such as social media.”[62] The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the “Petabyte club” in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.[63]
The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology.[64] For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company’s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.[65]
Competition[edit]
Teradata's main competitors are similar products from vendors such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and Sybase IQ. Also, competitors include data warehouse appliance vendors such as Netezza[66] (acquired in November 2010 by IBM), DATAllegro (acquired in August 2008 by Microsoft), ParAccel (acquired in April 2013 by Actian in April 2013), Pivotal Greenplum Database (acquired in July 2010 by EMC Corporation in July 2010), and Vertica Systems (acquired in February 2011 by HP), and from packaged data warehouse applications such as SAP BW.
Teradata has also seen competition from Hadoop-based distributions and other open source technologies.

We Believe...
Analytics and data unleash the potential of great companies.
Analytics and data have become the number one asset in organizations that are driving differentiated value. When companies view their data as such, they have the ability to transform their organization.
Whether your company is working to reduce the time for clinical trial for new drugs, improve yield for farmers by improving knowledge of soil conditions, improving power efficiency while lowering carbon emissions, or improving communications between people, there is unlimited potential to what data and analytics can unleash.

Teradata Corporation is a provider of database-related products and services. The company was formed in 1979 in Brentwood, California, as a collaboration between researchers at Caltech and Citibank's advanced technology group.[2] The company was acquired by NCR Corporation in 1991, and subsequently spun-off again as an independent public company on October 1, 2007.
The company produces a relational database management system of the same name, which it markets as a data warehouse. It also acquired new technologies by making many acquisitions. In 2015, after continued losses, the company announced a business transformation review, which led to divestitures and replacement of executives.[3] Teradata employed 10,093 at the end of 2016, and had corporate headquarters Dayton, Ohio.[1]

Corporate overview[edit]
Teradata is an enterprise software company that develops and sells a relational database management system (RDBMS) with the same name. Teradata is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the stock symbol TDC.[4]
The flagship Teradata product is referred to as a "data warehouse system" which stores and manages data. The data warehouses use a "shared nothing architecture", which means that each server node has its own memory and processing power.[5] Adding more servers and nodes increases the amount of data that can be stored. The database software runs on the servers and spreads the workload among them.[6] In 2010, Teradata added text analytics to track unstructured data, such as word processor documents, and semi-structured data, such as spreadsheets.[7]
Teradata has a supplier diversity program that designates a minimum of 3 to 5% of spending on minority, women, veteran, or small business vendors.[8] In 2013, the Ethisphere Institute named Teradata as one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies."[9]
Teradata holds an annual user group conference and expo known as Teradata Partners with keynote industry speakers, educational sessions led by customers and other vendors.[10] The Teradata Partners Conference has been an annual event since 1985.[11] The conference involves lectures and speeches on technical and business topics and announcements about new products.[12]
History[edit]




NCR Teradata Worldmark 5100 in 2002


The concept of Teradata grew from research at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and from the discussions of Citibank's advanced technology group in the 1970s.[13] The company was incorporated in 1979 in Brentwood, California by Jack E. Shemer, Philip M. Neches, Walter E. Muir, Jerold R. Modes, William P. Worth, Carroll Reed and David Hartke. In 1984 Teradata released its DBC/1012 specialized database computer.[14] [15] In 1990 it acquired Sharebase, originally named Britton Lee.[16]
In September 1991 AT&T Corporation acquired NCR Corporation,[17] which in December announced the acquisition of Teradata for about $250 million. Kenneth W. Simonds had been chief executive since 1986.[18] In 1992 Teradata built the first system over 1 terabyte, at Wal-Mart.[19] A Teradata database became the world's largest at 11 terabytes in 1992. By 1997 NCR became independent from AT&T.[17]
In 1999 NCR acquired Strategic Technologies & Systems, and appointed Stephen Brobst as chief technology officer of the Teradata Solutions Group. In April 2000 NCR acquired Ceres Integrated Solutions and its customer relationship management software for $90 million,[20] and in July Stirling Douglas Group and its demand chain management software.[21] In 2005, it acquired financial management software from DecisionPoint.[22]
In January 2007 NCR announced Teradata would become an independent public company, led by Michael F. Koehler.[23][24] The new company's shares started trading in October.[4] In March 2008 Teradata acquired professional services company Claraview, which previously had spun out software provider Clarabridge.[25]
In August 2010, Teradata acquired column-oriented DBMS vendor Kickfire.[26][27] In December it acquired marketing software company Aprimo for about $550 million.[28][29] In March 2011 it acquired Aster Data Systems for about $263 million.[30][31] In May 2012 Teradata acquired email direct marketing company eCircle, which was merged into the Aprimo business.[32]
In July, 2014, Teradata acquired the assets of Revelytix, a provider of information management products and for a reported $50 million, Hadapt, a company that developed the database management system Presto for Apache Hadoop,[33][34][35] and in September, Hadoop service firm Think Big Analytics.[36] In December, Teradata acquired RainStor, a company specializing in online data archiving on Hadoop.[37]
In January 2015 Teradata acquired Appoxxee, a mobile marketing software as a service provider, for about $20 million.[38] In September Teradata acquired digital marketing company FLXone, based in the Netherlands.[39] In November 2015, after continued losses and declining revenue, a business transformation review was announced.[3] The company terminated "co-president" Herman Wimmer in December 2015, although it later had to pay more than 4.2 million Euros and a company car as severance.[40]
In April, 2016, a product line called IntelliFlex was announced.[41] On May 5, 2016 Victor L. Lund, who had been an executive of American Stores from 1977 to 1999, became the chief executive.[42] In July 2016, the marketing applications division, using the Aprimo brand, was sold to private equity firm Marlin Equity Partners for about $90 million. This was hundreds of millions less than it paid making the acquisitions of several companies merged into the unit.[43][44] Marlin combined businesses of the former eCircle, Appoxee, and Ozone businesses with an email marketing company BlueHornet (that it had acquired in 2015), using the brand Mapp Digital in September 2016.[45]
On July 21, 2016, Teradata acquired Big Data Partnership, a service company based in the UK.[46]
Technology and products[edit]
See also: Teradata Geospatial, Teradata Warehouse Miner, and Teradata Parallel Transporter
Active enterprise data warehouse[edit]
Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse, often called Teradata Database, includes data management tools and data mining software. Teradata's product can be used for business analysis. Data warehouses can track company data, such as sales, customer preferences, product placement, etc.[6] The data warehouse differentiates between “hot and cold” data – meaning that the warehouse puts data that is not often used in a slower storage section.[47] The original system used a proprietary network technology called BYNet.[48]
Teradata Database 13.10 was announced in October 2010.[49][50] At the time, Teradata used Xeon 5600 processors for the server nodes.[51]
Teradata Database 14 was sold as the upgrade to 13.10 in 2011 and runs multiple data warehouse workloads at the same time.[52] It includes column-store analyses.[53]
Teradata Integrated Analytics[54] is a set of tools for data analysis that resides inside the data warehouse.[55]
Teradata Warehouse Miner provides and interface for data mining on Microsoft Windows. It was released before 2003.[56]
Aster Platform[edit]
The Aster Platform is Teradata's analytic technology, acquired from Aster Data Systems.[57]
Backup, archive, and restore[edit]
BAR is Teradata’s backup and recovery system.[58]
The Teradata Disaster Recovery Solution is automation and tools for data recovery and archiving. Customer data can be stored in an offsite recovery center.[59]
QueryGrid[edit]
The Teradata database includes a feature called QueryGrid, [60] that allows user of the Teradata database to fetch data from external databases from standard SQL queries, as if they were hosted in the local EDW. The data movement happens in parallel whenever possible, so it is as efficient as performance the external data source; this is usually still much slower than native Teradata database performance, but still acceptable for exploratory tasks. External data sources are Aster, Presto, Teradata, Hive and Oracle.
Platform family[edit]
Teradata Platform Family is a set of products that include the Teradata Data Warehouse, Database, and a set of analytic tools. The platform family is marketed as smaller and less expensive than the other Teradata products.[61]
Big data[edit]
Teradata began to market with the term “big data” in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributed the rise of big data to “new media sources, such as social media.”[62] The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the “Petabyte club” in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.[63]
The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology.[64] For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company’s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.[65]
Competition[edit]
Teradata's main competitors are similar products from vendors such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and Sybase IQ. Also, competitors include data warehouse appliance vendors such as Netezza[66] (acquired in November 2010 by IBM), DATAllegro (acquired in August 2008 by Microsoft), ParAccel (acquired in April 2013 by Actian in April 2013), Pivotal Greenplum Database (acquired in July 2010 by EMC Corporation in July 2010), and Vertica Systems (acquired in February 2011 by HP), and from packaged data warehouse applications such as SAP BW.
Teradata has also seen competition from Hadoop-based distributions and other open source technologies.
