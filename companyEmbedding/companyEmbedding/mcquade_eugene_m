For Immediate Release
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C)

July 13, 2015
Citi Board Elects Eugene M. McQuade to Board of Directors


New York  Citi's Board of Directors today announced that it has elected Eugene M. McQuade as a new non-executive director, effectively immediately. Mr. McQuade is the former CEO of Citibank, N.A. and former Vice Chairman of Citigroup and is currently the Chairman of the Board of XL Group.

		"We are pleased to have Gene McQuade join us on the Citigroup board," said Citi Chairman Michael E. O'Neill. "Not only does Gene bring a wealth of expertise from his deep experience in banking, but he also offers continuity of knowledge in the capital planning process which has become so central to our business planning."

		"When we called upon Gene to delay his retirement to help guide our capital planning process this past year, he took on that role with characteristic poise and professionalism," said Citi CEO Michael Corbat. "We look forward to continuing to have his wise counsel in this capacity."

		Mr. McQuade was elected Vice Chairman of Citigroup in April 2014 with responsibility for overseeing stress testing and capital planning until his retirement in May 2015. From 2009 to 2014 he was Chief Executive Officer of Citibank, N.A. with responsibility for corporate governance and franchise management in 101 countries around the globe. He also had operating responsibility for Citi Holdings and Citi's business in Japan. Mr. McQuade previously had responsibility for Citigroup's Audit and Compliance functions. He was a member of Citigroup's Operating Committee and serves on the Board of Citibank, N.A.

		Previously, Mr. McQuade served as Vice Chairman and President of Merrill Lynch Banks (U.S.). Prior to joining Merrill, he served for three years (2004-2007) as President and Chief Operating Officer and a Director of Freddie Mac. Previously, he had been President of Bank of America, helping to bring about the 2004 merger between that company and FleetBoston Financial, where he also served as President and Chief Operating Officer.

		Before working at Fleet, Mr. McQuade served as Executive Vice President and Controller at Manufacturers Hanover Corp., a predecessor of J.P. Morgan Chase. He began his career at KPMG Peat Marwick in New York.

		Mr. McQuade is a Certified Public Accountant, earning a degree in accounting from St. Bonaventure University, of which he was a Trustee and was awarded an honorary Doctorate in 2013. He is a Trustee to The Boys & Girls Club of America and the American Ireland Fund as well as a Director of Catholic Charities in New York. Mr. McQuade has served on the Boards of Directors of Merrill Lynch Banks, Bank of America and FleetBoston.

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

A President Is Appointed at Freddie Mac

Correction AppendedFreddie Mac, the giant mortgage backer, which is rebuilding its leadership after an accounting scandal last year, on Thursday named Eugene M. McQuade, a former executive at FleetBoston and Bank of America, as its new president and chief operating officer.Just eight months ago, Freddie Mac, which is based in McLean, Va., named Richard F. Syron, a former president of the American Stock Exchange, as chairman and chief executive after the company's primary regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, demanded that it make management changes.In an interview Thursday, Mr. Syron called the addition of Mr. McQuade, who will assume his new post on Sept. 1, and of several other new senior executives part of an effort ''to really make this a company of excellence.''''We're demonstrating that we're bringing leaders into the company,'' Mr. Syron continued. ''We've also refocused the company on mission and put a strong emphasis on transparency and integrity.''

Created by the federal government in 1970, Freddie Mac is the second-largest buyer of home mortgages after Fannie Mae. The company was intended to stabilize mortgage markets and to increase home ownership and rental opportunities. Continue reading the main story

Last November, an 11-month accounting review found that it had understated its earnings by nearly $5 billion over more than three years, as it sought to iron out earnings volatility and produce growth that was smooth and investor-friendly.Mr. Syron has said the company's troubles were the result of ''an accounting problem,'' and ''not an economic problem.''Mr. McQuade, 55, is a certified public accountant who has worked in financial businesses for decades and had something of a star-studded rise at Fleet. He joined the company in 1992 and was named its chief financial officer a year later, after mortgage lending and commercial loan losses led to a shake-up in which several top Fleet executives left.In the next decade, Fleet acquired a number of other banks as it sought to become a nationwide consumer lender.

In 2002, Mr. McQuade was named president and chief executive, and after Bank of America acquired Fleet in April, he became that company's president.But he left a month later with a $25 million severance package, saying that ''the challenge in the short term just wasn't there.''Mr. McQuade said his primary goals at Freddie Mac would be to ''create value for shareholders and restore the reputation of this company.''He said his close relationship with Wall Street and his experience in working with regulators would help him steer the mortgage buyer in the right direction.

''I think what I bring is 30 years of experience in terms of managing large financial functions,'' Mr. McQuade said. ''What I can bring is some leadership. They're playing catch-up right now. Perhaps I can help them catch up a little faster.''Richard Bove, an analyst with Hoefer & Arnett, a brokerage firm and investment bank, said Mr. McQuade was ''thought to be the guy who turned Fleet around when Fleet got into trouble a few years back.''''He's a very strong, hands-on type of leader'' with ''financial savvy,'' Mr. Bove said, adding, ''The guy's skill sets are very much in line with what Freddie Mac is looking for.''Correction: August 7, 2004, Saturday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about Freddie Mac's appointment of a president, Eugene M. McQuade, a former executive at FleetBoston and Bank of America, misstated his last title at FleetBoston. He was president and chief operating officer, not chief executive.
