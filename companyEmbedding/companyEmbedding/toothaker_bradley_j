Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Bad on you Great Lakes Capital
Bad on you Bradley Company
Bad on you Bradley Toothaker
Bad on you Bryse Toothaker
Your companies have over 100 employees and you have to team up all your resources and steal my father’s equity who was your own customer and brought you over 20 listings which your company never ran my Dads MLS listing. Also my Das gave you the opportunity to refinance my Dads $19 Million Dollar package of properties and your company bought my Dads note and took title to my Dads properties while you were my Dads finance broker and Realtor.  My Dad trusted Bradley Company at 112 W Jefferson Blvd, Suite 300, South Bend, IN 46601 owned by Bradley Toothaker to publish listings on the MLS for properties for Sale and Lease and my Dad gave Bradley company over 20 new listings and Bradley Company did not list my Dad’s properties for Sale or Lease on the MLS but instead had their sister company Great Lakes Capital LLC buy my Dads note from note from his bank and Bradley Companies other sister company took deeds to my Dads 22 properties and now many of properties are listed on Bradley Companies own websites for Sale and Lease. Do you want Bradley Company to do this to you???   You will not even know it is coming 22 properties they stripped from my Dad. Bradley Company – Crooks, Dishonest, Liars, Cheaters, Thieves, etc, etc, etc, etc. If you want to lose your properties list with Bradley Company.
Great Lakes Capital at 112 W Jefferson Blvd, Suite 200, South Bend, IN 46601 owned by Bradley J Toothaker was given rent rolls, income and expense statements, fact sheets, pictures, etc on each of approximately 22 of my Dads properties.
Great Lakes Capital was hired to refinance my loan with a new lender to get my Dad away from his bank at the time and Great Lakes Capital Owned by Bradley J. Toothaker took my Dads information and bought my Dads note from his bank and put the deeds to my Dads over 20 properties in a Bradley Company) Great Lakes Capital Company affiliate companies name owned by Bradley J. Toothaker.    They stripped my Dad from over $18 Million in equity he worked over 35 years for many, many, many long hard hours.
Bradley Company hired an employee to do a majority of this to my Dad that has done this before to other people and now Bradley Company won’t give back my Dads monies or properties.
How does Bradley Company and Great Lakes Capital get to sleep at night knowing what they did to my father.
Steal millions from your own customers.
How do you go home at end of the day and tell your wife, husband, children, Grand Children, etc how you just ripped off another business owner and tell them that this is the right thing to do and lead by example.
How to you go to church or be a public leader stealing business owners equity
Money is not worth hurting another persons hard work of 35 years over.
Bradley J. Toothaker, Bryse Thoothaker, Bradley Company and Great Lakes Capital my Dad never met only the local salesperson John A. Mundell III you and for you to do this to him is cruel, evil and wrong.
Any one that can join in on any information for our lawsuit against Bradley Company, Great Lakes Capital, BradleyJ. Toothaker,  Bryse Toothaker, John A. Mundell III.
 
Reason of review: Damaged or defective.
Monetary Loss: $20000.
