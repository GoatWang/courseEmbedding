You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

A friend of mine highly recommended Dr. Greenberg and told me what a terrific exam he gives and how great the staff is.  He was 100% correct.  When I picked up my new glasses I couldn't believe the difference in my vision. I was able to see things that I haven't been able to see clearly in literally years.My wife came with me to pick out frames and she was so impressed by the great selection of frames and how helpful the staff was in finding the frame that fit me perfectly.  I would recommend Old Bridge Vision and Dr. Greenberg to anyone.Old Bridge Vision IncWilliam C. ratedExperienced and friendly staff, wide selection of frames. Could not be happier with the service I recieved. Would definitely recommend to my friends and family!!
