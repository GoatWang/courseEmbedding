James Henry Hammond (November 15, 1807 – November 13, 1864) was an attorney, politician and planter from South Carolina. He served as a United States Representative from 1835 to 1836, the 60th Governor of South Carolina from 1842 to 1844, and United States Senator from 1857 to 1860. He was considered one of the major spokesmen in favor of slavery in the years before the American Civil War.
Acquiring property through marriage, he ultimately owned 22 square miles, several plantations and houses, and more than 300 slaves.[2] Through his wife's family, he was a brother-in-law of Wade Hampton II and uncle to his children, including Wade Hampton III. When the senior Hampton learned that Hammond had abused his four Hampton nieces as teenagers, he made the scandal public. It was thought to derail Hammond's career for a time,[2] but he was later elected as US senator. The Hampton family suffered more, as none of the girls married.

Biography[edit]
Hammond graduated from South Carolina College in 1825, going on to teach school, write for a newspaper and study law. He was admitted to the bar in 1828 and started a practice in Columbia, South Carolina. He established a newspaper there in support of nullification.
Hammond "secured his financial independence" by marrying Catherine Elizabeth Fitzsimmons, who was a shy, plain 17-year-old with a substantial dowry.[2] He became a wealthy man through this marriage and entered the planter class. He ultimately owned 22 square miles, a number of plantation houses, and more than 300 slaves.[2]
After his marriage, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the Nullifier Party, serving from 1835 until his resignation the next year due to ill health. After spending two years in Europe, he returned to South Carolina and engaged in agricultural pursuits; managing his large holdings took much of his time.
He was elected as Governor of South Carolina, serving from 1842 to 1844. The legislature chose him for the United States Senate in 1857 following the death of Andrew P. Butler, and he served from 1857 until his resignation in 1860 in light of South Carolina's secession from the Union. Hammond died on November 13, 1864 at what is now the Redcliffe Plantation Historic Site in Beech Island, SC.
Pro-slavery[edit]
A Democrat, Hammond was perhaps best known during his lifetime as an outspoken defender of slavery and states' rights.[3] He popularized the phrase that "Cotton is King" in his March 4, 1858, speech to the US Senate, saying:

“In all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life. . . . It constitutes the very mudsill of society.” He went on to utter the oft-repeated words, “You dare not make war on cotton — no power on earth dares make war upon it. Cotton is king.”[4]

In his writings, he consistently compared the South's "well compensated" slaves to the free labor of the North, describing the latter as "scantily compensated" slaves (as he termed the hired skilled laborers and operatives).[3]
Going beyond articles in local newspapers, he co-authored The Pro-Slavery Argument with William Harper, Thomas Roderick Dew, and William Gilmore Simms.[5][6] Hammond and Simms were part of a "sacred circle" of intellectuals, including Edmund Ruffin, Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, and George Frederick Holmes, who promoted reformation in the South in various forms. As supporters of slavery, they both justified it in terms of stewardship of inferior beings and promoted slaveholders' improvement of their treatment of slaves.[7][8]
Hammond promoted Redcliffe, his plantation in Beech Island, South Carolina,[9] as his ideal of the perfectly run plantation in his Plantation manual, 1857-58.[4] It includes a wide range of material, with detailed rules regulating treatment of pregnant and nursing slaves (whom he allowed to nurse their infants for 12 months), old slaves no longer fit for heavy field work, together with rules about clothing, quarters, food, etc., in addition to livestock and crop management.[4]
Sexuality[edit]
In the late 20th century, historians learned that Hammond as a young man had a homosexual relationship with a college friend, Thomas Jefferson Withers, which is attested by two sexually explicit letters sent from Withers to Hammond in 1826. The letters, which are held among the Hammond Papers at the South Carolina Library, were first published by researcher Martin Duberman in 1981; they are notable as rare documentary evidence of same-sex relationships in the antebellum United States.[10]
Hammond's Secret and Sacred Diaries (not published until 1989) reveal that his sexual appetites were varied. He described, without embarrassment, his "familiarities and dalliances"[2] over two years with four teenage nieces, daughters of his sister-in-law Ann Fitzsimmons and her husband Wade Hampton II.[2][11] He blamed his behavior on what he described as the seductiveness of the “extremely affectionate” young women.[2] The scandal "derailed his political career" for a decade to come after Wade Hampton III publicly accused him in 1843, when Hammond was governor.[12] He was "ostracized by polite society" for some time, but in the late 1850s, he was nonetheless elected by the state legislature as US senator.[13]
Hammond's damage to the girls was far-reaching. Their social prospects were destroyed. Considered to have tarnished social reputations by his behavior, none of the four ever married.[2]
Hammond was also known to have had long-term sexual relationships with two female slaves, one of whom was his own daughter. He took the first slave, Sally Johnson, as a concubine when she was 18 years old.[2] Such behavior was not uncommon among white men of power at the time; their mixed-race children were born into slavery and remained there unless the fathers took action to free them.[13] Later, Hammond took Sally Johnson's daughter, Louisa, who was a year old baby when he bought his mother, as a concubine when the girl was 12; she also bore several of his children.
His wife left him for a few years, after he began the relationship with the slave girl, taking their own children with her. She later returned to her husband.[2]
Legacy[edit]

Hammond School in Columbia, South Carolina, was originally named after him, as the James H. Hammond Academy, when founded in 1966. It was one of a number of private schools known as "segregation academies". Although many of these private academies are now defunct, Hammond School continued to develop; after the 1970s, it expanded its admission policy to be non-discriminatory. The school changed its name to reflect its new approach.

Hammond's quotes on slavery[edit]

Kirby Page used quotes from Hammond on slavery in his book, Jesus or Christianity (1929):


"I firmly believe," said Governor J. H. Hammond, "that American slavery is not only not a sin, but especially commanded by God through Moses, and approved by Christ through his apostles."[14]


Governor J. H. Hammond once said: "I endorse without reserve the much abused sentiment of Governor McDuffie, that 'slavery is the corner-stone of our republican edifice;' while I repudiate, as ridiculously absurd, that much lauded but nowhere accredited dogma of Mr. Jefferson that 'all men are born equal.'"[15]

James Henry Hammond (November 15, 1807 – November 13, 1864) was an attorney, politician and planter from South Carolina. He served as a United States Representative from 1835 to 1836, the 60th Governor of South Carolina from 1842 to 1844, and United States Senator from 1857 to 1860. He was considered one of the major spokesmen in favor of slavery in the years before the American Civil War.
Acquiring property through marriage, he ultimately owned 22 square miles, several plantations and houses, and more than 300 slaves.[2] Through his wife's family, he was a brother-in-law of Wade Hampton II and uncle to his children, including Wade Hampton III. When the senior Hampton learned that Hammond had abused his four Hampton nieces as teenagers, he made the scandal public. It was thought to derail Hammond's career for a time,[2] but he was later elected as US senator. The Hampton family suffered more, as none of the girls married.

Biography[edit]
Hammond graduated from South Carolina College in 1825, going on to teach school, write for a newspaper and study law. He was admitted to the bar in 1828 and started a practice in Columbia, South Carolina. He established a newspaper there in support of nullification.
Hammond "secured his financial independence" by marrying Catherine Elizabeth Fitzsimmons, who was a shy, plain 17-year-old with a substantial dowry.[2] He became a wealthy man through this marriage and entered the planter class. He ultimately owned 22 square miles, a number of plantation houses, and more than 300 slaves.[2]
After his marriage, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the Nullifier Party, serving from 1835 until his resignation the next year due to ill health. After spending two years in Europe, he returned to South Carolina and engaged in agricultural pursuits; managing his large holdings took much of his time.
He was elected as Governor of South Carolina, serving from 1842 to 1844. The legislature chose him for the United States Senate in 1857 following the death of Andrew P. Butler, and he served from 1857 until his resignation in 1860 in light of South Carolina's secession from the Union. Hammond died on November 13, 1864 at what is now the Redcliffe Plantation Historic Site in Beech Island, SC.
Pro-slavery[edit]
A Democrat, Hammond was perhaps best known during his lifetime as an outspoken defender of slavery and states' rights.[3] He popularized the phrase that "Cotton is King" in his March 4, 1858, speech to the US Senate, saying:

“In all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life. . . . It constitutes the very mudsill of society.” He went on to utter the oft-repeated words, “You dare not make war on cotton — no power on earth dares make war upon it. Cotton is king.”[4]

In his writings, he consistently compared the South's "well compensated" slaves to the free labor of the North, describing the latter as "scantily compensated" slaves (as he termed the hired skilled laborers and operatives).[3]
Going beyond articles in local newspapers, he co-authored The Pro-Slavery Argument with William Harper, Thomas Roderick Dew, and William Gilmore Simms.[5][6] Hammond and Simms were part of a "sacred circle" of intellectuals, including Edmund Ruffin, Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, and George Frederick Holmes, who promoted reformation in the South in various forms. As supporters of slavery, they both justified it in terms of stewardship of inferior beings and promoted slaveholders' improvement of their treatment of slaves.[7][8]
Hammond promoted Redcliffe, his plantation in Beech Island, South Carolina,[9] as his ideal of the perfectly run plantation in his Plantation manual, 1857-58.[4] It includes a wide range of material, with detailed rules regulating treatment of pregnant and nursing slaves (whom he allowed to nurse their infants for 12 months), old slaves no longer fit for heavy field work, together with rules about clothing, quarters, food, etc., in addition to livestock and crop management.[4]
Sexuality[edit]
In the late 20th century, historians learned that Hammond as a young man had a homosexual relationship with a college friend, Thomas Jefferson Withers, which is attested by two sexually explicit letters sent from Withers to Hammond in 1826. The letters, which are held among the Hammond Papers at the South Carolina Library, were first published by researcher Martin Duberman in 1981; they are notable as rare documentary evidence of same-sex relationships in the antebellum United States.[10]
Hammond's Secret and Sacred Diaries (not published until 1989) reveal that his sexual appetites were varied. He described, without embarrassment, his "familiarities and dalliances"[2] over two years with four teenage nieces, daughters of his sister-in-law Ann Fitzsimmons and her husband Wade Hampton II.[2][11] He blamed his behavior on what he described as the seductiveness of the “extremely affectionate” young women.[2] The scandal "derailed his political career" for a decade to come after Wade Hampton III publicly accused him in 1843, when Hammond was governor.[12] He was "ostracized by polite society" for some time, but in the late 1850s, he was nonetheless elected by the state legislature as US senator.[13]
Hammond's damage to the girls was far-reaching. Their social prospects were destroyed. Considered to have tarnished social reputations by his behavior, none of the four ever married.[2]
Hammond was also known to have had long-term sexual relationships with two female slaves, one of whom was his own daughter. He took the first slave, Sally Johnson, as a concubine when she was 18 years old.[2] Such behavior was not uncommon among white men of power at the time; their mixed-race children were born into slavery and remained there unless the fathers took action to free them.[13] Later, Hammond took Sally Johnson's daughter, Louisa, who was a year old baby when he bought his mother, as a concubine when the girl was 12; she also bore several of his children.
His wife left him for a few years, after he began the relationship with the slave girl, taking their own children with her. She later returned to her husband.[2]
Legacy[edit]

Hammond School in Columbia, South Carolina, was originally named after him, as the James H. Hammond Academy, when founded in 1966. It was one of a number of private schools known as "segregation academies". Although many of these private academies are now defunct, Hammond School continued to develop; after the 1970s, it expanded its admission policy to be non-discriminatory. The school changed its name to reflect its new approach.

Hammond's quotes on slavery[edit]

Kirby Page used quotes from Hammond on slavery in his book, Jesus or Christianity (1929):


"I firmly believe," said Governor J. H. Hammond, "that American slavery is not only not a sin, but especially commanded by God through Moses, and approved by Christ through his apostles."[14]


Governor J. H. Hammond once said: "I endorse without reserve the much abused sentiment of Governor McDuffie, that 'slavery is the corner-stone of our republican edifice;' while I repudiate, as ridiculously absurd, that much lauded but nowhere accredited dogma of Mr. Jefferson that 'all men are born equal.'"[15]

Hammond's damage to the girls was far-reaching. Their social prospects were destroyed. Considered to have tarnished social reputations by his behavior, none of the four ever married.[2]
Hammond was also known to have had long-term sexual relationships with two female slaves, one of whom was his own daughter. He took the first slave, Sally Johnson, as a concubine when she was 18 years old.[2] Such behavior was not uncommon among white men of power at the time; their mixed-race children were born into slavery and remained there unless the fathers took action to free them.[13] Later, Hammond took Sally Johnson's daughter, Louisa, who was a year old baby when he bought his mother, as a concubine when the girl was 12; she also bore several of his children.
His wife left him for a few years, after he began the relationship with the slave girl, taking their own children with her. She later returned to her husband.[2]
Legacy[edit]

Hammond School in Columbia, South Carolina, was originally named after him, as the James H. Hammond Academy, when founded in 1966. It was one of a number of private schools known as "segregation academies". Although many of these private academies are now defunct, Hammond School continued to develop; after the 1970s, it expanded its admission policy to be non-discriminatory. The school changed its name to reflect its new approach.

Hammond's quotes on slavery[edit]

Kirby Page used quotes from Hammond on slavery in his book, Jesus or Christianity (1929):


"I firmly believe," said Governor J. H. Hammond, "that American slavery is not only not a sin, but especially commanded by God through Moses, and approved by Christ through his apostles."[14]


Governor J. H. Hammond once said: "I endorse without reserve the much abused sentiment of Governor McDuffie, that 'slavery is the corner-stone of our republican edifice;' while I repudiate, as ridiculously absurd, that much lauded but nowhere accredited dogma of Mr. Jefferson that 'all men are born equal.'"[15]

James Henry Hammond (November 15, 1807 – November 13, 1864) was an attorney, politician and planter from South Carolina. He served as a United States Representative from 1835 to 1836, the 60th Governor of South Carolina from 1842 to 1844, and United States Senator from 1857 to 1860. He was considered one of the major spokesmen in favor of slavery in the years before the American Civil War.
Acquiring property through marriage, he ultimately owned 22 square miles, several plantations and houses, and more than 300 slaves.[2] Through his wife's family, he was a brother-in-law of Wade Hampton II and uncle to his children, including Wade Hampton III. When the senior Hampton learned that Hammond had abused his four Hampton nieces as teenagers, he made the scandal public. It was thought to derail Hammond's career for a time,[2] but he was later elected as US senator. The Hampton family suffered more, as none of the girls married.

Biography[edit]
Hammond graduated from South Carolina College in 1825, going on to teach school, write for a newspaper and study law. He was admitted to the bar in 1828 and started a practice in Columbia, South Carolina. He established a newspaper there in support of nullification.
Hammond "secured his financial independence" by marrying Catherine Elizabeth Fitzsimmons, who was a shy, plain 17-year-old with a substantial dowry.[2] He became a wealthy man through this marriage and entered the planter class. He ultimately owned 22 square miles, a number of plantation houses, and more than 300 slaves.[2]
After his marriage, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the Nullifier Party, serving from 1835 until his resignation the next year due to ill health. After spending two years in Europe, he returned to South Carolina and engaged in agricultural pursuits; managing his large holdings took much of his time.
He was elected as Governor of South Carolina, serving from 1842 to 1844. The legislature chose him for the United States Senate in 1857 following the death of Andrew P. Butler, and he served from 1857 until his resignation in 1860 in light of South Carolina's secession from the Union. Hammond died on November 13, 1864 at what is now the Redcliffe Plantation Historic Site in Beech Island, SC.
Pro-slavery[edit]
A Democrat, Hammond was perhaps best known during his lifetime as an outspoken defender of slavery and states' rights.[3] He popularized the phrase that "Cotton is King" in his March 4, 1858, speech to the US Senate, saying:

“In all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life. . . . It constitutes the very mudsill of society.” He went on to utter the oft-repeated words, “You dare not make war on cotton — no power on earth dares make war upon it. Cotton is king.”[4]

In his writings, he consistently compared the South's "well compensated" slaves to the free labor of the North, describing the latter as "scantily compensated" slaves (as he termed the hired skilled laborers and operatives).[3]
Going beyond articles in local newspapers, he co-authored The Pro-Slavery Argument with William Harper, Thomas Roderick Dew, and William Gilmore Simms.[5][6] Hammond and Simms were part of a "sacred circle" of intellectuals, including Edmund Ruffin, Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, and George Frederick Holmes, who promoted reformation in the South in various forms. As supporters of slavery, they both justified it in terms of stewardship of inferior beings and promoted slaveholders' improvement of their treatment of slaves.[7][8]
Hammond promoted Redcliffe, his plantation in Beech Island, South Carolina,[9] as his ideal of the perfectly run plantation in his Plantation manual, 1857-58.[4] It includes a wide range of material, with detailed rules regulating treatment of pregnant and nursing slaves (whom he allowed to nurse their infants for 12 months), old slaves no longer fit for heavy field work, together with rules about clothing, quarters, food, etc., in addition to livestock and crop management.[4]
Sexuality[edit]
In the late 20th century, historians learned that Hammond as a young man had a homosexual relationship with a college friend, Thomas Jefferson Withers, which is attested by two sexually explicit letters sent from Withers to Hammond in 1826. The letters, which are held among the Hammond Papers at the South Carolina Library, were first published by researcher Martin Duberman in 1981; they are notable as rare documentary evidence of same-sex relationships in the antebellum United States.[10]
Hammond's Secret and Sacred Diaries (not published until 1989) reveal that his sexual appetites were varied. He described, without embarrassment, his "familiarities and dalliances"[2] over two years with four teenage nieces, daughters of his sister-in-law Ann Fitzsimmons and her husband Wade Hampton II.[2][11] He blamed his behavior on what he described as the seductiveness of the “extremely affectionate” young women.[2] The scandal "derailed his political career" for a decade to come after Wade Hampton III publicly accused him in 1843, when Hammond was governor.[12] He was "ostracized by polite society" for some time, but in the late 1850s, he was nonetheless elected by the state legislature as US senator.[13]
Hammond's damage to the girls was far-reaching. Their social prospects were destroyed. Considered to have tarnished social reputations by his behavior, none of the four ever married.[2]
Hammond was also known to have had long-term sexual relationships with two female slaves, one of whom was his own daughter. He took the first slave, Sally Johnson, as a concubine when she was 18 years old.[2] Such behavior was not uncommon among white men of power at the time; their mixed-race children were born into slavery and remained there unless the fathers took action to free them.[13] Later, Hammond took Sally Johnson's daughter, Louisa, who was a year old baby when he bought his mother, as a concubine when the girl was 12; she also bore several of his children.
His wife left him for a few years, after he began the relationship with the slave girl, taking their own children with her. She later returned to her husband.[2]
Legacy[edit]

Hammond School in Columbia, South Carolina, was originally named after him, as the James H. Hammond Academy, when founded in 1966. It was one of a number of private schools known as "segregation academies". Although many of these private academies are now defunct, Hammond School continued to develop; after the 1970s, it expanded its admission policy to be non-discriminatory. The school changed its name to reflect its new approach.

"I firmly believe," said Governor J. H. Hammond, "that American slavery is not only not a sin, but especially commanded by God through Moses, and approved by Christ through his apostles."[14]

Hammond once said: "I endorse without reserve the much abused sentiment of Governor McDuffie, that 'slavery is the corner-stone of our republican edifice;' while I repudiate, as ridiculously absurd, that much lauded but nowhere accredited dogma of Mr. Jefferson that 'all men are born equal.'"[15]

James Henry Hammond (November 15, 1807 – November 13, 1864) was an attorney, politician and planter from South Carolina. He served as a United States Representative from 1835 to 1836, the 60th Governor of South Carolina from 1842 to 1844, and United States Senator from 1857 to 1860. He was considered one of the major spokesmen in favor of slavery in the years before the American Civil War.
Acquiring property through marriage, he ultimately owned 22 square miles, several plantations and houses, and more than 300 slaves.[2] Through his wife's family, he was a brother-in-law of Wade Hampton II and uncle to his children, including Wade Hampton III. When the senior Hampton learned that Hammond had abused his four Hampton nieces as teenagers, he made the scandal public. It was thought to derail Hammond's career for a time,[2] but he was later elected as US senator. The Hampton family suffered more, as none of the girls married.

Biography[edit]
Hammond graduated from South Carolina College in 1825, going on to teach school, write for a newspaper and study law. He was admitted to the bar in 1828 and started a practice in Columbia, South Carolina. He established a newspaper there in support of nullification.
Hammond "secured his financial independence" by marrying Catherine Elizabeth Fitzsimmons, who was a shy, plain 17-year-old with a substantial dowry.[2] He became a wealthy man through this marriage and entered the planter class. He ultimately owned 22 square miles, a number of plantation houses, and more than 300 slaves.[2]
After his marriage, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the Nullifier Party, serving from 1835 until his resignation the next year due to ill health. After spending two years in Europe, he returned to South Carolina and engaged in agricultural pursuits; managing his large holdings took much of his time.
He was elected as Governor of South Carolina, serving from 1842 to 1844. The legislature chose him for the United States Senate in 1857 following the death of Andrew P. Butler, and he served from 1857 until his resignation in 1860 in light of South Carolina's secession from the Union. Hammond died on November 13, 1864 at what is now the Redcliffe Plantation Historic Site in Beech Island, SC.
Pro-slavery[edit]
A Democrat, Hammond was perhaps best known during his lifetime as an outspoken defender of slavery and states' rights.[3] He popularized the phrase that "Cotton is King" in his March 4, 1858, speech to the US Senate, saying:

“In all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life. . . . It constitutes the very mudsill of society.” He went on to utter the oft-repeated words, “You dare not make war on cotton — no power on earth dares make war upon it. Cotton is king.”[4]

In his writings, he consistently compared the South's "well compensated" slaves to the free labor of the North, describing the latter as "scantily compensated" slaves (as he termed the hired skilled laborers and operatives).[3]
Going beyond articles in local newspapers, he co-authored The Pro-Slavery Argument with William Harper, Thomas Roderick Dew, and William Gilmore Simms.[5][6] Hammond and Simms were part of a "sacred circle" of intellectuals, including Edmund Ruffin, Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, and George Frederick Holmes, who promoted reformation in the South in various forms. As supporters of slavery, they both justified it in terms of stewardship of inferior beings and promoted slaveholders' improvement of their treatment of slaves.[7][8]
Hammond promoted Redcliffe, his plantation in Beech Island, South Carolina,[9] as his ideal of the perfectly run plantation in his Plantation manual, 1857-58.[4] It includes a wide range of material, with detailed rules regulating treatment of pregnant and nursing slaves (whom he allowed to nurse their infants for 12 months), old slaves no longer fit for heavy field work, together with rules about clothing, quarters, food, etc., in addition to livestock and crop management.[4]
Sexuality[edit]
In the late 20th century, historians learned that Hammond as a young man had a homosexual relationship with a college friend, Thomas Jefferson Withers, which is attested by two sexually explicit letters sent from Withers to Hammond in 1826. The letters, which are held among the Hammond Papers at the South Carolina Library, were first published by researcher Martin Duberman in 1981; they are notable as rare documentary evidence of same-sex relationships in the antebellum United States.[10]
Hammond's Secret and Sacred Diaries (not published until 1989) reveal that his sexual appetites were varied. He described, without embarrassment, his "familiarities and dalliances"[2] over two years with four teenage nieces, daughters of his sister-in-law Ann Fitzsimmons and her husband Wade Hampton II.[2][11] He blamed his behavior on what he described as the seductiveness of the “extremely affectionate” young women.[2] The scandal "derailed his political career" for a decade to come after Wade Hampton III publicly accused him in 1843, when Hammond was governor.[12] He was "ostracized by polite society" for some time, but in the late 1850s, he was nonetheless elected by the state legislature as US senator.[13]
Hammond's damage to the girls was far-reaching. Their social prospects were destroyed. Considered to have tarnished social reputations by his behavior, none of the four ever married.[2]
Hammond was also known to have had long-term sexual relationships with two female slaves, one of whom was his own daughter. He took the first slave, Sally Johnson, as a concubine when she was 18 years old.[2] Such behavior was not uncommon among white men of power at the time; their mixed-race children were born into slavery and remained there unless the fathers took action to free them.[13] Later, Hammond took Sally Johnson's daughter, Louisa, who was a year old baby when he bought his mother, as a concubine when the girl was 12; she also bore several of his children.
His wife left him for a few years, after he began the relationship with the slave girl, taking their own children with her. She later returned to her husband.[2]
Legacy[edit]

Hammond School in Columbia, South Carolina, was originally named after him, as the James H. Hammond Academy, when founded in 1966. It was one of a number of private schools known as "segregation academies". Although many of these private academies are now defunct, Hammond School continued to develop; after the 1970s, it expanded its admission policy to be non-discriminatory. The school changed its name to reflect its new approach.

Hammond's quotes on slavery[edit]

Kirby Page used quotes from Hammond on slavery in his book, Jesus or Christianity (1929):


"I firmly believe," said Governor J. H. Hammond, "that American slavery is not only not a sin, but especially commanded by God through Moses, and approved by Christ through his apostles."[14]


Governor J. H. Hammond once said: "I endorse without reserve the much abused sentiment of Governor McDuffie, that 'slavery is the corner-stone of our republican edifice;' while I repudiate, as ridiculously absurd, that much lauded but nowhere accredited dogma of Mr. Jefferson that 'all men are born equal.'"[15]

Faust




James Henry Hammond and the Old South: A Design for 
	Mastery.  By Drew Gilpin Faust.  (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State 
	University Press, 1982).
 
            Contradictions defined the life of South 
	Carolina’s James Henry Hammond.  Hammond (1807–1864) rose from common roots 
	to become a critic of social mobility.  The son of a schoolmaster from New 
	England, Hammond became an ardent defender of slavery and the Old South’s 
	hierarchical society.  Perpetually concerned with self-control, Hammond 
	found himself lacking confidence and wrecked his political ambitions with a 
	sex scandal.  Drew Gilpin Faust explores these fallacies and more in 
	James Henry Hammond and the Old South.  Faust, now president of Harvard 
	University, drew heavily upon Hammond’s papers for her second book.  The 
	biography won the Jules F. Landry Award for 1982.  The prize is given to the 
	most outstanding southern study published by Louisiana State University 
	Press.
Faust divides the book into 
	five parts and follows the chronology of Hammond’s life from his youth, 
	marriage and plantation management, his early political career, his 
	intellectual career, and his final political deeds and death.  Hammond was 
	the eldest child and son of an educator from Massachusetts and a South 
	Carolina woman from modest means.  His upcountry family owned few slaves but 
	Hammond’s father, Elisha Hammond, instilled a ferocious ambition in his 
	son.  Elisha Hammond forced the young Hammond to exercise constant and 
	unremitting self-control.  He compelled the boy to pursue education and 
	warned him to respect the state’s slaveholding aristocracy.  His father’s 
	tutelage allowed Hammond to enter South Carolina College as a junior.  
	There, as a senior, he heard a professor articulate the emerging 
	conservative social thought that would come to dominate the southern mind.  
	Hammond’s two-year college career followed the model established by his 
	father.  He excelled in his studies and led an oratory club.  Graduation, 
	however, unleashed insecurity.  Hammond wandered around the state from 
	job-to-job and worked as a tutor and schoolteacher.   His domineering 
	father’s fortunes failed and he relied on Hammond for support.  Hammond 
	struggled to balance his father’s expectations with his own lust for 
	flirtatious women.  Hammond settled into the study of law, opened his own 
	practice in Columbia, and, during the 1832 Nullification Crisis, controlled 
	a leading nullifier newspaper.
Hammond’s social and financial 
	fortunes improved when he married Charleston heiress Catherine Fitzsimons.  
	Hammond gained control of her family’s plantation, Silver Bluff, and its 
	large slave population.  Hammond embraced his new membership in the planter 
	class and, ironically given his station as a child, derided social and 
	political mobility.  Hammond argued that the elites should be concerned with 
	the welfare of the lower classes just as a planter cared for his slaves.  
	Hammond’s talk of masters showing a paternal interest in their slaves did 
	not match his actions.  He implemented progressive farming techniques at 
	Silver Bluff that enhanced his wealth and devastated his slaves.  He 
	exercised strict control over the lives of his slaves.  He forbid black 
	preachers and prohibited religious gatherings.  Hammond insisted on naming 
	slave children.  Ironically, he fathered slave children and his wife 
	temporarily abandoned their marriage.
Hammond parlayed the notoriety 
	he gained during the Nullification Crisis and his new social standing into 
	one unremarkable term in the U.S. House of Representatives (1835–1836).  In 
	Congress, he declared slavery a positive good and southern slavery as a 
	model for society.  His term as governor (1842–1844) ended with disgrace as 
	Wade Hampton II, the husband of Catherine Hammond’s older sister, accused 
	Hammond of seducing his four teenage daughters.  The scandal threatened to 
	destroy Hammond’s political career.
Hammond saw himself as the 
	political heir of John C. Calhoun.  His reputation still in ruins, Hammond 
	failed to win Calhoun’s seat after the senator’s death in 1850.  Hammond 
	retired to his plantation, sulked, and tried to express his intellect in 
	writing.  Relief came with his election to the U.S. Senate on the eve of the 
	Civil War.  His term, like his time as Congressman and governor, was short 
	and unexceptional.  His single speech came in 1858 surrounding the 
	controversy over the admission of Kansas with the proslavery Lecompton 
	Constitution.  Hammond spoke of southern superiority and the Old South’s 
	leadership of the nascent United States.  He bragged about his region’s 
	social, economic, and military strength.   The North would regret a war with 
	the South.  “No,” Hammond declared, “you dare not make war on cotton.  No 
	power on earth dares make war on it.  Cotton is King” (p. 346).  
	Hammond resigned from the Senate with South Carolina seceded.
            A man obsessed with control, Hammond failed 
	to keep one brother from becoming a drunk and another from serving as a 
	surgeon in the Union army.  Hammond died with Sherman’s troops marching 
	triumphantly toward South Carolina.  Hammond provides his biographer with 
	plenty of material.  Faust tells his outrageous story with helpful 
	explanations and careful analysis.

	By Drew Gilpin Faust. (Baton  Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 
	1982). 

James Henry Hammond 
	emerged from relative poverty to become one of the most prominent 
	politicians in South Carolina in the early nineteenth century. Drew Gilpin 
	Faust’s biography James Henry Hammond and the Old South examines his 
	life and career in an era of sectional tensions as he fought to defend the 
	southern way of life. Hammond served in a variety of political positions, 
	being elected to the United States House of Representatives, the Governor’s 
	office, and the Senate on the eve of the Civil War. Though committed to 
	Republican ideals, Hammond supported the secession of South Carolina as a 
	means to protect the institution of slavery and southern society.

Hammond entered the 
	aristocratic plantation society with his marriage to Catherine Fitzsimons, 
	who inherited a plantation at Silver Bluff. Though his family had owned a 
	handful slaves periodically during his childhood, for the first time Hammond 
	found himself in the position of managing a large number of slaves. He 
	thought of himself as a “beneficent master whose guidance and control 
	represented the best of all possible worlds for the uncivilized and backward 
	people entrusted to him by God” (73), though in reality he sought to 
	dominate and control every aspect of his slaves’ lives. He eliminated 
	preaching by slaves and religious congregations within the slave community. 
	Hammond also altered the labor system of his plantation in order to reduce 
	recreational time for the slaves and increase efficiency. He took even the 
	most basic choices away from his slaves  by naming their children. Hammond 
	fathered children by some of his slaves, but believed freeing them would be 
	cruelty. Instead, he instructed his legitimate son to keep them as slaves in 
	the family and not to make them slaves of strangers. Although he married 
	into the plantation society, Hammond wholly adopted the lifestyle and 
	ideology of a southern gentleman. He recognized that plantations became 
	“little kingdoms,” and understood that owning a plantation and slaves 
	advanced his social status and political ambitions.   

A supporter of both 
	states’ rights and slavery, Hammond used the nullification crisis to propel 
	himself into the House of Representatives. Once elected, he delivered the 
	first Congressional defense of slavery as a “positive good.” While a staunch 
	supporter of the southern institution, Hammond always felt himself an 
	outside in society. Once elected Governor of South Carolina, his 
	brother-in-law, Wade Hampton II, played on these fears in retaliation for 
	Hammond’s sexual indiscretions with his four daughters. After discovering 
	the affair, Hampton succeeded in alienating Hammond from aristocratic 
	society. Unfortunately, by airing the scandal, Hampton ensured his daughters 
	would remain unmarried for the rest of their lives. As a senator on the eve 
	of the Civil War, Hammond continued to advocate the southern way of life. He 
	felt that the south’s social and economic institutions, largely built on 
	slavery, proved themselves superior to those in the north. He warned the 
	north not to make war on the south, as southern cotton production had become 
	a worldwide economic staple. He believed that the labor system that produced 
	cotton, namely slavery, ensured the humane treatment of workers, which the 
	free labor system in the north did not. In Hammond, the South found a 
	rallying point.

Hammond died in 
	November of 1864, shortly before the end of the Civil War. He clung to the 
	southern way of life until the very end, calling slave children to his bed 
	to sing spirituals. Rather than acknowledge the impending failure of the 
	south, Hammond chose to remain fully committed to slavery. Faust’s biography 
	is well researched and she presents an honest portrayal of Hammond. He 
	proved a man of contradictions, believing in the Republic but still 
	championing the south. He rose to the top of southern society, yet always 
	felt himself an outsider. Hammond is not portrayed a hero of the south, 
	rather Faust creates a tragic figure with few redeeming qualities. The 
	author relies on Hammond’s personal papers to great effect. Hammond comes to 
	represent the south’s total commitment to slavery, even to the point of 
	accepting obvious moral and philosophical contradictions.

South: A Design for Mastery.  Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 
1982.
       In 1982 Drew Gilpin Faust produced a biography of 
prominent South Carolina politician and planter James Henry Hammond. Hammond, 
throughout the antebellum period, staunchly defended southern society and 
slavery.  The South Carolinian believed that a system based upon deference and 
bonded labor offered an ideal model for other societies.  Hammond was even ready 
to endorse secession when the election of the Republican Abraham Lincoln, in the 
minds of many southerners, threatened the peculiar institution.  Faust, though, 
notes numerous contradictions that existed throughout Hammond’s life.  While 
Hammond was one of the foremost spokesmen for the South he increasingly felt 
alienated from certain aspects central to the region’s society.  The author 
stresses these contradictions throughout her narrative.
       Faust spends the first part of her book detailing 
the early years of Hammond’s life.  The prominent southern politician began his 
life as the son of a middle class educator.  Elisha Hammond, James’s father, put 
immense pressure on his son to succeed in both school and life.  The younger 
Hammond, a byproduct of antebellum South Carolina, accepted the aristocratic 
society and slave culture of the state.  His positions only hardened when he 
entered planter society through his marriage to the Charleston heiress Catherine 
Fitzsimons.
       This union allowed Hammond to live the life of a 
powerful South Carolinian planter.  The planter class, like in all other states 
of the Old South, dominated almost all political and social leadership 
positions.  Hammond became one of the strongest advocates of the position of 
South Carolina’s elites.  He decried the increasing social and political 
mobility emerging in the state.  This was despite the fact that Hammond himself 
was a product of this process of upward mobility.  
       Faust also delves into Hammond’s views on slavery.  
She spends several illuminating chapters on life at Silver Bluff, Hammond’s 
South Carolina plantation.  Faust describes how Hammond’s view on relationships 
between masters and slaves crystallized.  Hammond, like many southern planters, 
saw themselves as paternal figures looking out after the interests of their 
slaves.  These planters saw their charges as children who needed the firm but 
guiding hand of the master.  In addition, the institution was a positive good 
that brought structure to African Americans.  By extension, Hammond thought that 
the plantation and its patriarchal structure offered the ideal model for how 
social relations should be structured.  A social order based upon the planter 
elites looking out for the welfare of the lower classes.
       Nevertheless, while Hammond became one of the most 
vocal supporters of the Old South he also felt like an outsider. Hammond, 
because of his education, considered himself an intellectual.  Hammond’s self 
described intellectualism set him apart from most southerners.  His enhanced 
feelings of exceptionalism led Hammond to enjoy the company of other alienated 
southerners like William Gilmore Simms.  Hammond and Simms both decried the lack 
of respect that the Old South possessed for the life of the mind.
       Faust’s biography is well written and accessible.  
The author also used Hammond’s personal papers to produce an interesting and 
illuminating portrait of the planter politician.  In addition, the author 
portrays Hammond as a deeply troubled man with her discussion of the South 
Carolinian’s incestuous relationship with his nieces. In all, Faust produces a 
fine study of the life and career of this influential southerner.

A Design for Mastery.
Baton Rouge, LA:  Louisiana State University Press, 1982.

Throughout history, many people have sought to gain immense power and
stooped to all levels to gain it. James Henry Hammond is a good example
of this type of motivation and Drew Gilpin Faust tells his story in her
book James Henry Hammond and the Old South. In her book, Faust not
only examines the life of Hammond but also explores the Old South on many
different levels.  Though this is not a comprehensive study of the
South it does highlight many different aspects of its past from relationships
between master and slave to the life of a prominent politician. All these
aspects present themselves in the life of a man driven by ambition to be
the most prominent and influential person in the South before the Civil
War.
Hammond came from a modest background that spurred him to become a very
ambitious person with the ultimate goal of ruling the South.  His
first step toward mastery of the South was at South Carolina College when
he received several honors for his oratory skills and became friends with
many prominent men of the South.  The next step he achieved towards
prominence came when he married into a wealthy family that gave him a large
plot of land and slaves.  With a plantation, he no longer had to worry
about supporting himself and began to focus his energies on politics.
Hammond entered South Carolina politics at the right moment to start
an outstanding political career, during the nullification crisis. 
The nullification crisis gave him a platform to speak about states’ rights. 
In the process, he ran and got elected to the House of Representatives. 
As a freshman representative, he quickly became well known throughout Washington,
D.C., for making a definitive stand against any possible move by the federal
government to rule against the permanency of slavery.  As quickly
as this gave him a name, poor health forced him out of politics. 
To recover, Hammond and his wife toured Europe for fifteen months, which
reinforced his belief in slavery, because of the number of impoverished
he saw.  When he returned to South Carolina he openly challenged John
C. Calhoun in an attempt to dethrone him from the major leadership role
of the South and failed.
For the remainder of his life he continued his quest of becoming the
leader of the South.  After a failed term as governor, spending thirteen
years as part of an elite academic group that attempted to design a way
to develop the economy of the South while maintaining its social structure,
and trying to replace Calhoun at his death by adopting his ideals, Hammond
was no closer to his goal than when he started.  His last chance came
when he unexpectedly won a seat in the Senate without putting his name
on the ballot.  He again won fame but could not hold onto it for long
since his ideas proved too moderate compared to the younger Southern politicians
that pushed for secession.  With his last chance at prominence gone,
he retired to his plantation.  In the end, Hammond represented the
Old South in his beliefs and actions.  When the Old South was disappearing
during the Civil War, his life did also.  The only thing Hammond had
to show for his life of pure ambition was a fractured and broken family
In the year that Faust published this book, he received the Jules F.
Landry Award for his work.  The book represents the award rightfully. 
Faust does an excellent job of not only telling the story of Hammond’s
life but also placing it into context and examining how the South functioned
during the time period.  The author does this in a subtle manner,
which allows the reader to follow Hammond’s life without interrupting the
flow of the book by pointing out direct parallels.  In addition, Faust
does not commit a common error among biographers, resorting to hero worship. 
He does a great job presenting all sides of the story, even those aspects
that seem damaging to Hammond’s name like his frolicking with his nieces,
marrying his wife for money and prestige, and his hypochondriac nature. 
Lastly, the author includes several charts and graphs in the appendix of
the book that clarify some of the information he presented in the body
of the book.
If there are any criticisms of the book, it is the lack of a bibliography. 
Faust makes up for this mistake with a short bibliographical essay on the
sources that he used.  Overall, I found this to be an excellent book. 
I would recommend this book for both undergraduate and graduate courses
on the Old South and the Civil War.

James Henry Hammond and the Old South: A Design for Mastery.
By Drew Gilpin Faust. (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1982) 
xvii + 407.
 The life of James Henry Hammond provides Drew Gilpin Faust with
a unique opportunity.  Hammond’s complexity and multiple achievements
enables the author to delve into many facets of Southern antebellum society
and thought through the life of his subject.  Hammond typifies the
aristocratic Southern plantation owner, owning a plantation with hundreds
of slaves.  His membership in a privileged class extended to participation
in government, serving successively as a congressman, governor and senator
of North Carolina.  Faust’s subject gave the famous “Cotton is King”
speech in the U. S. Senate, and in addition to writing a well received
defense of slavery also served as a general in the militia and was also
an influential agricultural reformer.
 Given the complexity of his subject, Faust could have been content
to merely tell his story (which he does to great satisfaction).  Instead
Faust finds in Hammond’s perplexing combinations of career an underlying
and unifying theme present throughout his life:  Hammond’s “design
for mastery.”
 All of Hammond’s endeavors (in Faust’s estimation), revolve around
the question of power and domination.  Aside from the obvious example
of his participation in the slave system, Faust finds this theme present
in Hammond’s relations with his poor white neighbors, his wife and his
mother, and even the foreign servants serving him during trips abroad.
 Hammond’s experiences led him to remark “I only succeed when everything
is under my control,” and Hammond “sought obedience” from others, in every
facet and in every social situation in which he found himself throughout
his life (112). Whether from his own mother, who felt obligated to circumvent
his wishes through a secret will, from his slaves, whom he beat and tried
to destroy their religion, or from his “equals” in government, whom he
also tried to dominate and control in all matters.
 Power and domination also extended to his involvement in illicit
relationships.  Affairs with slave mistresses may have been common,
and Hammond engaged in them constantly.  Less common was his liaison
with his four nieces, ages twelve to seventeen at the beginning, with him
he engaged in “an extraordinary petting orgy,” over a period of years.
 In looking at this theme of power and domination, Faust constructs
in a sense a kind of “psycho-history” of Hammond.  Not explicitly
Freudian, Faust finds her subject craving, through domination, “a need
for love (242).”  While Faust does not delve into the language of
any particular school of thought psychologically, she is almost obligated
to deal with these issues having identified them as a unifying theme.
The implications of Faust’s theme naturally extends to the results of
Hammond’s attempts at domination, and she finds unequivocally that he failed
miserably.  His attempts to destroy his slaves independent church
failed, as did his total regulation of their lives. Slaves ran away, stole
food and sabotaged his control over them in numerous other ways.
His marriage floundered through his affairs and his wife left him several
times due to his refusal to give up his plantation mistresses, having fathered
children by both a mother and her daughter.  Politically he could
never fully dominate his fellows and his advocation of conciliation during
the time of secession gained him isolation rather than the domination he
sought.  His affair with his nieces left him in a sort of political
“exile,” which lasted nearly sixteen years. His coldness and impossible
demands on his sons led to threats on his part to disinherit them.
Discovering all of these failures, Faust draws as her controversial
conclusion that masters, through participation in the slave system, must
themselves also lead a life of dependence and domination. Hammond, like
all masters, was also a slave, and ultimately it killed him.  His
driving desire to dominate extended to control of his bowels, which he
attempted to control through the ingestion of mercury-based laxatives that
eventually poisoned him.
Kenneth Greenbert, Faust’s reviewers, points out that her theme, “first
and best stated by Hegal,” also informed the writings of David B. Davis
and Eugene Genovese (Kenneth Greenberg Reviews in History Sept.
1983, 387).  Attempts to of one human being to dominate another always
end in failure. Hammond’s slaves molded Hammond as much as he molded them. 
His wife determined the effects of his excesses with his mistresses, not
Hammond. Wade Hampton’s threats to expose his tryst with his nieces determined
the course of his political career.
In all of this it is hard to see Hammond’s excesses as representing
any sort of need for love.  Another reviewer states, “To call the
furies that drove Hammond a need for love seems to domesticate them beyond
belief (Michael P. Johnson, Journal of Southern History, Nov. 1983,
620).  While one may disagree with the reasons and psychological conclusions
one draws from Faust’s portrait of Hammond, she provides a compelling and
important portrait and narrative of a complex individual driven by power
and the paradox posed by his experience.
