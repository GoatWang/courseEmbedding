By participating in the Plan, investors may purchase additional shares of common stock by reinvesting some or all of the cash dividends received on shares of our common stock.  If you elect to participate in the Plan, you may also make optional cash purchases of shares of our common stock subject to certain limitations detailed in the Plan Prospectus.  For the Plan Prospectus and additional information on the Plan, please visit the Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase page of our website.7. Who is the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Direct Stock Purchase Plan Administrator? Who do I contact with additional questions?Computershare is the Plan Administrator and they can be reached at:

Computershare - Investor Services
P.O. Box 505000 
Louisville, KY  40233 
1 (800) 733-5001 (U.S. and Canada) 
1 (781) 575-2879 (Outside U.S. and Canada
www.computershare.com/investor

Please contact Computershare or AGNC Investor Relations with questions.8. How do I enroll in the dividend reinvestment and/or direct stock purchase plan?The Plan is an “opt-in” plan.  If you are a registered holder of our common stock, you may join the Plan by signing an enrollment form and returning it to the Plan Administrator or by going online to the Plan Administrator’s website, www.computershare.com/investor.  If you are enrolling for dividend reinvestment, the enrollment form must be received by the Plan Administrator prior to the dividend record date in order to take effect as of the related dividend payment.
If you are a new investor, you may join the Plan in either of the following ways:

Going to the Plan Administrator’s website at www.computershare.com/investor, and following the instructions provided for opening a Plan account online (click on “Buy Shares” in the Transactions tab).  You will be asked to complete an Online Initial Enrollment Form and to submit an initial optional cash purchase between $250 and $10,000.  To make an initial optional cash purchase you may authorize a one-time online bank debit from your U.S. bank account or you may authorize a minimum of five (5) consecutive monthly automatic deductions of at least $50 each from your U.S. bank account.
Completing and signing an Initial Enrollment Form obtained from the Plan Administrator, Computershare, and submitting an initial investment in the amount between $250 and $10,000.  To make an initial optional cash purchase in this manner, you may enclose a check, payable in U.S. funds and drawn against a U.S. bank, to “Computershare - American Capital Agency Corp.” or you may complete the direct debit authorization form obtained from the Plan Administrator and authorize a minimum of five consecutive monthly automatic deductions of at least $50 each from your U.S. bank account by following the instructions provided.

If you are enrolling by making an optional cash purchase, the enrollment form and investment funds must be received by the Plan Administrator at least one business day before the date such funds are to be invested for a particular month.  Enrollment forms may be obtained at any time by telephonic, Internet or written request to the Plan Administrator.9. How do I enroll in the Plan if I hold shares with a broker (beneficial owner)?If you are a beneficial owner, that is, your shares are held on the books of the Plan Administrator in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, your distributions will be reinvested automatically by the Nominee in additional shares under the Plan only if your Nominee provides such a service and you elect to participate in the Plan.  Many Nominees do not provide such a service and routinely request dividends and distributions to be paid in cash on all shares registered in their names.  Therefore, if your shares are held for your account by a Nominee and you would like to participate in the Plan, then in addition to enrolling in the Plan as provided in Question 8, you must either make appropriate arrangements for your Nominee to participate on your behalf, or you must become a stockholder of record by having a part or all of your shares transferred to your own name.

If your shares are held in the name of a Nominee, you should contact the Nominee directly for details.10. What limitations apply to optional cash purchases?Interested prospective investors who are not currently holders of our common stock may make their initial purchase through the Plan, subject to a minimum purchase of $250.  Plan Participants may make optional cash payments of $50 to $10,000 or, with our prior approval, in excess of $10,000 per month.
Cash purchases of more than $10,000 per month may be made only pursuant to our acceptance of a request to make such a purchase. If participants wish to make an optional cash purchase in excess of $10,000 (or other maximum amount established by us) for any month, participants must obtain our prior written approval with a form (“Request for Waiver”) and a copy of such written approval must accompany any such optional cash purchase.  We have sole discretion to grant any approval for optional cash purchases in excess of the allowable maximum amount.  Unless the participant has complied with these procedures, any amount submitted for investment over $10,000 will be returned without interest.
We expect to approve requests for optional cash purchases in excess of $10,000 from financial intermediaries, including brokers and dealers, and other participants from time to time.  Participants may ascertain whether we are accepting Requests for Waivers in any given month, and certain other important information, by contacting us on the first business day of each month at (301) 968-9302 or such other number as we may establish from time to time.  When participants call this number we will inform such participants (by a prerecorded message) of one of the following:

that we will not be accepting requests for waivers that month
that we will be accepting requests for waivers that month.  In that case, we will provide relevant information such as the date on which a Pricing Period will begin; the number of days in the Pricing Period; the Waiver Discount, if applicable; the Threshold Price , if applicable; and whether or not the Pricing Period Extension Feature will be activated (Pricing Period, Waiver Discount, Threshold Price and Pricing Period Extension Feature are all explained in detail in the Plan Prospectus); or
that we have not yet determined whether we will be accepting waivers.  If this is the case, we will inform participants of a date later in the month when they can call to ascertain whether we will be accepting Requests for Waivers.

For additional information pertaining to the Request for Waiver, please review the Plan prospectus which can be found on the Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase page of our website.  Participants may download the Request for Waiver Form on the Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase page.
11. How can I make an optional cash purchase?Participants in the Plan may make an optional cash payment for purchase of additional shares of common stock at any time, subject to limitations listed in Question 10 above.
Participants may do so in one of three ways:

By Check.  Participants can make additional cash investments by sending a check ($50-$10,000), payable to Computershare – American Capital Agency Corp., in U.S. dollars drawn on a U.S. bank.  Cash, traveler’s checks, money orders or third party checks are not acceptable.  Optional cash investments may be mailed to the Plan Administrator with the tear-off portion of the account statement or via detailed written instructions and enclosed in the return envelope with each statement, or mailed to the address specified on the statement.  Checks must be received by the Plan Administrator at least two (2) business days before an investment date in order to be invested on that date.  When investing by check, participants do not need to invest the same amount each time and are under no obligation to make investments in any month or at any particular time.
By One-Time Online Bank Debit.  A registered holder of common stock can make an investment online ($50-$10,000) by logging on to www.computershare.com/investor, selecting “Investor Centre,” and following the online instructions.  Registered holders should refer to the online confirmation for their bank account debit date and investment date.  When investing by one-time online bank debit, registered holders do not need to invest the same amount each time and are under no obligation to make investments in any month or at any particular time.
By Recurring Automatic Debits from a U.S. Bank Account.  A registered holder may also authorize the Plan Administrator, on a Direct Authorization Form or the Plan Administrator’s website, www.computershare.com/investor, to make recurring monthly purchases of a specified dollar amount ($50-$10,000) paid for by automatic withdrawal from the registered holder’s U.S. bank account.  Funds will be withdrawn from the bank account, via electronic funds transfer, on the 20th day of each month (or the next business day if the 20th day is not a business day).  Requests will be processed and will become effective as promptly as practicable; however, registered holders should allow two to four weeks for the first investment to be initiated.  Automatic deductions will continue at the level set until a registered holder changes his or her instructions by notifying the Plan Administrator.  To terminate monthly purchases by automatic withdrawal, written, signed instructions must be sent to the Plan Administrator.  It is the responsibility of the registered holder to notify the Plan Administrator if any direct debit information changes.12. Is there a cost to participate in the Plan?We will pay all administrative costs associated with the reinvestment of dividends under the Plan. There are no transaction or processing fees, expenses or service charges under the Plan in connection with such purchases; however, if you enroll in the Plan through a broker, bank or other nominee, they may charge you a fee for participating on your behalf. If the Plan purchases shares with reinvested dividends in market transactions instead of directly from us, we will pay any brokerage fees or commissions on such purchases.
For the optional cash purchase part of the Plan, the Plan Administrator will charge participants a processing fee of $0.05 per share purchased in connection with any optional cash payments made under the Plan. The processing fee includes any brokerage commissions that the Plan Administrator is required to pay. In addition, the Plan Administrator will charge participants a $5 transaction fee for optional cash payments made by check or one-time online ACH, and a $2.50 transaction fee for each optional cash payment made by recurring debit from a U.S. bank account.13. When will shares of common stock be purchased under the Plan?Dividend Reinvestments.  In the months in which dividends are paid, dividends will be invested beginning on the dividend or distribution payment date.  If the shares of our common stock are to be newly issued or treasury shares, such shares will be issued or delivered on the dividend or distribution payment date.  If our shares of common stock are to be purchased by the Plan Administrator in the open market, the Plan Administrator will make every effort to invest any dividends it receives promptly beginning on each dividend or distribution payment date, and in no event later than thirty days from such date, except where necessary under any applicable federal securities laws.
Initial and Optional Cash Purchases up to $10,000. For common stock acquired directly from us, the purchase date will generally be on the 25th calendar day of each month, or the next trading day if the 25th day is not a trading day.  For common stock acquired in market transactions, purchases will begin on the 25th calendar day of each month, or the next trading day if the 25th day is not a trading day, and will be completed no later than thirty-five (35) days following such date, except where reinvestment of such funds at a later date is necessary or advisable under applicable securities laws.  The Plan Administrator will commingle all funds received from participants.  Once a participant has placed an order, he or she may not request a cash refund or otherwise change the order.
No interest will be paid on funds pending investment held by the Plan Administrator.14. Who do I contact with questions about my account activity, replacing lost or stolen certificates, transferring securities, dividend payments, direct deposit information or processing a change of address?If your shares are held with a broker, please contact your broker directly.
If you are a shareholder of record, please contact our transfer agent:

As such, we are required to distribute annually 90% of our taxable net income. As long as we qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate taxes on our taxable net income to the extent that we distribute all of our annual taxable net income to our stockholders.
Distributions to stockholders will generally be taxable as ordinary income. However, a portion of such distributions may be designated by us as long-term capital gain to the extent that such portion is attributable to our sale of capital assets held for more than one year.

(NASDAQ:AGNC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AGNC Investment's Q2 2017 And 7/21/2017 BV Projection (Includes MTGE And NLY BV Projection)Jul.24.17 | About: AGNC Investment (AGNC) Scott Kennedy Value, mREITs, BDCs, dividend investingSummaryI am projecting AGNC Investment Corp. will report a minor decrease in quarterly BV for the second quarter of 2017.This projection is mainly due to minor-to-modest net price increases in most fixed-rate agency MBS coupons offset by a modest net decrease in the company's derivatives valuation.My projections for AGNC's BV per common share as of 6/30/2017 and 7/21/2017 are stated in the "Conclusions Drawn" section of the article.My projection for MTGE Investment Corp.'s BV per common share as of 6/30/2017 is stated near the "Conclusions Drawn" section of the article. I also discuss Annaly Capital Management's estimated BV as of 6/30/2017.The continued neutral/muted relationship between MBS prices and derivative instrument valuations should be seen as a cautious catalyst/trend regarding mREIT book values and stock valuations.Focus of Article The focus of this article is to provide a detailed projection of AGNC Investment Corp.'s (NASDAQ:AGNC) book value (“BV”) per common share as of 6/30/2017. Prior to results being provided to the public on 7/26/2017 (via the company’s quarterly press release), I would like to analyze AGNC's BV as of 6/30/2017 and provide readers a general direction on how I believe this recent quarter has panned out. A previous three-part article I wrote laid the ground works for this BV projection. In that article, I projected/analyzed the company’s income statement (technically speaking, its “consolidated statement of comprehensive income") for the second quarter of 2017. The links to that three-part projection article are provided below: AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement Projection - Part 1 (Including Current Recommendation)  AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement and EPS Projection - Part 2 AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement and EPS Projection - Part 3 By understanding the trends that occurred within AGNC's operations during the second quarter of 2017, one can apply this information to sector peers as well. As such, the discussion/analysis below is not solely applicable to AGNC but to the fixed-rate agency mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) sector as a whole. This includes, but is not limited to, the following fixed-rate agency mREIT peers: 1) Arlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE:AI); 2) ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc. (NYSE:ARR); 3) Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. (NYSE:CHMI); 4) CYS Investments Inc. (NYSE:CYS); 5) Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NYSE:NLY); and 6) Orchid Island Capital Inc. (NYSE:ORC). Technically speaking, several years ago AI changed its “entity status" from a REIT to a C-Corp. per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). However, AI still maintained many “mREIT-like" characteristics, including the type of investments held by the company and the amount of annual dividend distributions paid to shareholders. 
 In addition, the following hybrid mREIT companies had at least a modest portion of each company’s MBS portfolio in fixed-rate agency MBS (also typically having higher durations): 1) Dynex Capital Inc. (NYSE:DX); 2) Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. (NYSE:IVR); 3) MFA Financial Inc. (NYSE:MFA); 4) AG Mortgage Investment Trust Inc. (NYSE:MITT); 5) MTGE Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:MTGE); 6) Two Harbors Investment Corp. (NYSE:TWO); and 7) Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corp. (NYSE:WMC). As such, the analysis below is not solely applicable to one company but more so the agency/hybrid mREIT sector as a whole. This article will also include a brief BV discussion/projection regarding AGNC's affiliate MTGE and the company’s sector peer NLY. Overview of AGNC's Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 Due to the fact that several figures needed to project/calculate AGNC’s BV as of 6/30/2017 come directly from its consolidated statements of comprehensive income, Table 1 is provided below. Table 1 shows the company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income from a three months-ended time frame. Using Table 1 below as a reference, one must add certain account figures from the first and second quarters of 2017 for purposes of projecting a suitable BV as of 6/30/2017. Table 1 - AGNC Three Months-Ended Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  



 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using data obtained from AGNC's quarterly investor presentation slides)
 Having provided Table 1 above, we can now begin to calculate its projected BV as of 6/30/2017. This projection will be calculated in Table 2 below. There will not be an identical sheet AGNC provides that matches the data within Table 2. I have gathered specific information derived from multiple tables/charts for a more detailed analysis of the company's BV as of 6/30/2017. AGNC, through its quarterly investor presentation slides (see link above), only provides the public with a “Book Value Roll Forward” slide. This specific slide uses information based only on a quarterly time frame. I perform a more detailed quarterly BV calculation/analysis based on the entire year. Table 2 - AGNC Three Months-Ended BV Projection (BV as of 6/30/2017)  

 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 2 above as a reference, let us take a look at the calculation for AGNC's projected BV as of 6/30/2017. Unless otherwise noted, all figures below are for the “six months ended” time frame. Let us take a look at the following figures in corresponding order to the “Ref.” column shown in Table 2 (next to the June 30, 2017 column): A) Operations; B) Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI/(OCL)); C) Stockholder Transactions; and D) Capital Share Transactions. A) Operations - Increase in Net Common Equity From Operations Estimate of $56 Million; Range ($194)-$306 Million  - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Red Reference “A” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column This “net increase (decrease) in net common equity from operations" figure consists of the following amounts that come directly from the company's consolidated statement of comprehensive income (see Tables 1 and 2 above): 1) net interest income; 2) total other income (loss); 3) total expenses; and 4) excise tax.
 Due to the fact I discussed these amounts in my previous three-part AGNC consolidated statement of comprehensive income projection article (see links near the top), further discussion of this figure is redundant/unwarranted. B) Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI/(OCL)) - Increase in Net Common Equity From Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) Estimate of $205 Million; Range $5-405 Million - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High  - See Red Reference “B” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column This “net increase (decrease) in net common equity from OCI/(OCL)” figure consists of the following accounts that come directly from the company's consolidated statement of comprehensive income (see Tables 1 and 2 above): 1) unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, net; and 2) unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net (upon reclassification to interest expense). Due to the fact I also discussed these accounts in my previous three-part AGNC consolidated statement of comprehensive income article (see links near the top), further discussion of this figure is redundant/unwarranted as well. C) Stockholder Transactions - Decrease in Net Common Equity From Stockholder Transactions Estimate of ($381) Million; Range ($391)-($371) Million  - Confidence Within Range = High  - See Red Reference “C” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column This “net increase (decrease) in net common equity from stockholder transactions” figure is AGNC's dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of 2017. This figure includes activity in relation to the following types of outstanding shares of stock: 1) common; and 2) preferred. 1) Common Stock Prior to projecting AGNC's common stock dividend distributions for the second quarter of 2017, let us first discuss how the number of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock could change during any given quarter. AGNC has the following four events/programs which could impact the number of outstanding shares of common stock it has when monthly dividends are declared: 1) public offering of shares (“bulk” issuance); 2) at-the-market (“ATM”) offering program; 3) dividend reinvestment/direct stock purchase program; and 4) stock repurchase program.
 On 5/2/2017, the company priced its previously announced public offering of 24.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $503 million. In addition, AGNC granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional 3.7 million shares of its common stock (within 30 days). I am projecting the underwriters' option was fully exercised. As such, I am projecting AGNC’s outstanding shares of common stock increased 28.2 million shares from its recent public offering of shares. Even though AGNC’s stock price throughout the quarter traded slightly-to-modestly above its “tangible" BV as of 3/31/2017 ($19.31 per share), I am making the assumption there was no activity within the company's ATM offering or dividend reinvestment/direct stock purchase programs during the second quarter of 2017. My reasoning is mainly due to the May 2017 equity offering described above. When it comes to AGNC’s repurchase program, this was created in October 2012 and was fairly recently amended in October 2016 to allow the company to repurchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock through 12/31/2017. As of 3/31/2017, the company had $1 billion remaining under its stock repurchase program. AGNC intends to buy back outstanding shares of common stock only when the repurchase price is materially accretive to CURRENT tangible BV. Since the stock price traded modestly-to-materially above the company’s “tangible” BV as of 3/31/2017 throughout the second quarter of 2017, I believe management did not repurchase any outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend declared on AGNC's common stock for the second quarter of 2017 totaled $0.54 per share. This was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter. When calculated, I am projecting AGNC had dividend distributions to common shareholders of ($189) million for the second quarter of 2017. When combined, I am projecting the company had dividend distributions to common shareholders of ($368) million for the six months ended 6/30/2017. Now let us project the preferred stock dividend distributions.
 2) Preferred Stock The dividend declared on AGNC’s “Series A Preferred Stock” (AGNCP) and “Series B Preferred Stock” (AGNCB) for the second quarter of 2017 was $0.50 per share and $0.484375 per depositary share, respectively. As such, this was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter. There were still 6.9 and 7.0 million outstanding shares of AGNCP and AGNCB as of 6/28/2017, respectively (ex-dividend date). When calculated, I am projecting AGNC had dividend distributions to AGNCP and AGNCB shareholders of ($3.5) and ($3.4) million for the second quarter of 2017, respectively. When combined, I am projecting the company had dividend distributions to preferred shareholders of ($13.7) million (rounded) for the six months ended 6/30/2017. After combining the common and preferred stock dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of 2017, I am projecting AGNC’s total “distributions to stockholders from estimated REIT taxable income/undistributed taxable income (“UTI”)” and decrease in net common equity from stockholder transactions was ($381) million (rounded) for the six months ended 6/30/2017 (see red reference “C” in Table 2 above). D) Capital Share Transactions - Increase in Net Common Equity From Capital Share Transactions Estimate of $555 Million; Range $475-575 Million - Confidence Within Range = High  - See Red Reference “D” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column As stated earlier, on 5/2/2017 AGNC priced its previously announced public offering of 24.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $503 million. In addition, the company granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional 3.7 million shares of its common stock (within 30 days). I am projecting the underwriters’ option was fully exercised. This calculates to additional gross proceeds of approximately $75 million. After accounting for all offering costs and the underwriters’ discount, I am projecting AGNC’s net proceeds from its May 2017 equity offering was approximately $555 million.
 In addition, I am making the assumption no additional shares of common stock were issued under its ATM offering or dividend reinvestment/direct stock purchase programs during the second quarter of 2017. Also, since there were no additional preferred stock equity offerings during the second quarter of 2017, the following figures should have no activity: 1) issuance of preferred stock; and 2) preferred stock $25,000 per share liquidation preference.  Since AGNC officially internalized its management structure through its acquisition of American Capital Mortgage Management (“ACMM”) last year, management may be partially compensated through the issuance of common stock subject to certain vesting options. As such, the company may have some minor amount of equity issuance through the following accounts: 1) issuance of restricted stock; and/or 2) issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation program. However, due to the immaterial impact such restricted stock and/or stock-based compensation would represent, I have projected no amount within these two accounts during the second quarter of 2017. Any actual amount of restricted stock and/or stock-based compensation during the second quarter of 2017 (through the issuance of new shares) would only have a fractional per share impact on its BV as of 6/30/2017.   Regarding AGNC’s “repurchases of common stock” figure, as stated earlier, I am making the assumption management did not purchase any outstanding shares of common stock under its stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2017. Therefore, I am projecting the company had a “net common equity from capital share transactions” figure of $555 million for the six months ended 6/30/2017 (see red reference “D” in Table 2 above). MTGE’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 When compared to AGNC, I am projecting MTGE had a slightly more favorable BV per share fluctuation (percentage-wise) for the second quarter of 2017. Each company’s agency MBS and derivatives portfolios as of 3/31/2017 had several similarities, which were discussed in my three-part AGNC income statement projection article (see links near the top). However, it should also be noted MTGE had a much larger non-agency MBS portfolio (with an attractive cost basis) and has recently “branched out” to invest in skilled nursing facilities and seniors housing. In comparison, AGNC has a very minor investment in AAA non-agency MBS and no exposure to the healthcare sector.
 When taking all quarterly activities into consideration (including additional data not discussed within this specific article), I am projecting MTGE will report the following BV per common share as of 6/30/2017: MTGE’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 = $19.55 Per Common Share (Range $19.05-20.05 Per Common Share) NLY’s BV as of 6/30/2017 As was highlighted in my three-part AGNC income statement projection article (see links near the top of this article), I discussed several differences between AGNC’s and NLY’s investment portfolio. Furthermore, it was discussed each company had a different strategy regarding derivative instruments going into the second quarter of 2017 (most notably the difference between each company’s hedging coverage ratio as of 3/31/2017). Simply put, NLY’s lower hedging coverage ratio at the start of the second quarter of 2017 was an advantage for the company when compared to AGNC. In addition, it should also be noted management has recently broadened NLY’s investment portfolio by allocating more capital into commercial debt/real estate, preferred equity, corporate debt, and most recently middle market (“MM”) lending. Furthermore, NLY recently acquired a variable-rate agency mREIT, Hatteras Financial Corp. (NYSE:HTS). Generally speaking these asset classes, when compared to fixed-rate agency MBS, performed similarly during the second quarter of 2017. On 7/17/2017, along with NLY’s announcement of a July 2017 equity offering, the company provided preliminary results to the public regarding its second quarter of 2017. Along with several other operating performance metrics, it announced an estimated BV as of 6/30/2017 of $11.19 per common share. Within the following MBS pricing article dated 6/20/2017, I projected NLY’s BV as of 6/16/2017 was $11.30 per common share (when INCLUDING the quarterly dividend accrual of $0.30 per common share, which had yet to occur as of 6/16/2017; the ex dividend date was 6/28/2017): Annaly Capital And CYS Investments: MBS Pricing For Q2 2017 (Includes Current BV Projections)
 Due to the negative relationship that existed between most MBS prices and derivative instrument valuations during the last two weeks of the quarter, I projected NLY’s BV as of 6/30/2017 was $11.20 per common share (prior to management providing quarterly results; several readers privately asked for my projection, which I provided as support). As such, I believe its preliminary estimated BV as of 6/30/2017 was basically an exact match to my projected BV. NLY’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 (Prior to Management’s Disclosure of Preliminary Results on 7/17/2017) = $11.20 Per Common Share (Range $10.80-11.40 Per Common Share) NLY’s Estimated BV as of 6/30/2017 Per Management’s Disclosure of Preliminary Results on 7/17/2017 = $11.19 Per Common Share Conclusions Drawn To sum up all the information discussed above, I am projecting AGNC will report the following BV per common share as of 6/30/2017: AGNC’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 = $20.72 Per Common Share (Range $20.22-21.22 Per Common Share)  This projection is a ($0.26) per common share decrease from its BV as of 3/31/2017. This minor decrease can be attributed to two factors. The first factor is in relation to the activity within the company's consolidated statement of comprehensive income. I am projecting AGNC will report a net loss of ($20) million for the second quarter of 2017, while reporting OCI of $159 million. When both figures are combined, I am projecting AGNC will report comprehensive income of $139 million for the second quarter of 2017. The second factor is in relation to the activity within AGNC’s equity section of the balance sheet. The company paid for/accrued dividend distributions totaling ($0.54) per common share during the second quarter of 2017. In addition, it paid for/accrued dividend distributions in regard to holders of the company's outstanding shares of preferred stock. Furthermore, AGNC's May 2017 equity offering resulted in some minor dilution. When combined, these two factors account for a projected quarterly BV decrease of ($0.26) per common share. When calculated, I am projecting AGNC’s BV per common share had a decrease of (1.24%) during the second quarter of 2017. I am also projecting the company generated an “economic return” (dividends paid/accrued for and net change in BV) of 1.37% for the second quarter of 2017. 
 Similar to the prior quarter, there was a more “neutral/muted” relationship between MBS prices and derivative instrument valuations during the second quarter of 2017 (“option adjusted spreads”, or OAS).  As such, I believe most mREIT peers will report only a minor (less than 5%) fluctuation in quarterly BV. With that being said, I believe most mREIT stock prices have already “priced in” this more neutral/muted relationship when it comes to sector valuations.  I believe four key factors to analyze within the fixed-rate agency mREIT sector this quarter are the following: 1) each company’s proportion of 15-year MBS holdings versus 30-year MBS holdings; 2) each company’s hedging coverage ratio; 3) each company’s proportion of long-term derivative instruments versus short-term derivative instruments; and 4) each company’s proportion of specified pools (for instance HARP and LLB securities). Dependent upon these factors, I believe results will slightly vary across most of the fixed-rate agency mREIT sector for the second quarter of 2017. Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2017, mortgage interest rates first increased and then recently have reversed course (through 7/21/2017). The fixed-pay rate on interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury yields have also seen the same trend through 7/21/2017 (when compared to 6/30/2017) . However, the forward LIBOR curve has remained relatively unchanged.  In addition, it should be noted the relationship between agency MBS pricing and derivative instrument valuations has been slightly positive through the first three weeks of July (minor tightening of spreads).  Through a detailed analysis that will be omitted from this particular article, I am projecting AGNC’s BV as of 7/21/2017 has fluctuated between ($0.10) and $0.30 per common share when compared to the company’s BV as of 6/30/2017. This projection excludes the July 2017 monthly dividend of $0.18 per common share (ex-dividend is 7/27/2017). My BUY, SELL, or HOLD Recommendation From the analysis provided above, including additional catalysts/factors not discussed within this particular article, I currently rate AGNC as a SELL when I believe the company’s stock price is trading at less than a (2.5%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017, a HOLD when trading at or greater than a (2.5%) but less than a (10.0%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017, and a BUY when trading at or greater than a (10.0%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017. These ranges are unchanged when compared to PART 1 of my income statement projection article (approximately three weeks ago).
 Therefore, I currently rate AGNC as a SELL (however, fairly close to my HOLD range), since the stock is trading at less than a (2.5%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017. My current price target for AGNC is approximately $20.25 per share. This is currently the price where my recommendation would change to a HOLD. The current price where my recommendation would change to a BUY is approximately $18.65 per share.       Along with the data presented within this article, this recommendation considers the following mREIT catalysts/factors: 1) projected future MBS price movements; 2) projected future derivative valuations; and 3) projected near-term dividend per share rates. This recommendation also considers the high probability of multiple Federal (“Fed”) Funds Rate increases by the FOMC during 2017-2018 (this is a more hawkish view when compared to most of last year) due to recent macroeconomic trends/events. This also considers the eventual “wind-down” of the Fed’s balance sheet.   Final Note: Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each reader’s current investing strategy. The factual information provided within this article is intended to help assist readers when it comes to investing strategies/decisions.   During January-March 2014, I initiated (and subsequently add to) a position in MTGE at a weighted average purchase price of $18.47 per share. On 3/4/2016 and 4/8/2016, I directly increased my position in the stock at a weighted average purchase price of $14.36 and $14.47 per share, respectively. These two combined purchases had the same approximate monetary value of my combined 2014 purchases. My entire MTGE position had a weighted average purchase price of $16.443 per share. On 6/15/2017, I sold my entire MTGE position at a weighted average price of $19.09 per share, as my price target of $19.10 was met that day. My MTGE total return (when including change in stock price and dividends received/gains on reinvested dividends) was 45.4%. My 2016 purchases were disclosed, at the time, to readers in subsequent AGNC articles over the following several months. My 2017 sale was disclosed to readers in “real time” (that day) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.
 On 11/27/2015, I initiated a position in AGNCB; Series B preferred stock. On 12/7/2015, 12/9/2015, 12/14/2015, 1/14/2016, and 1/20/2016 I selectively increased my position in AGNCB. When combined, my AGNCB position has a weighted average purchase price of $23.215 per share. This weighted average per share price excludes all dividends received/reinvested. I currently hold (personally and through affiliated entities) 0.71% of the outstanding shares of AGNCB. Each AGNCB trade was disclosed to readers in real time (that day) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.     On 7/21/2017, I initiated a position in AGNCP; Series A preferred stock. My AGNCP position has a weighted average purchase price of $25.325 per share. I currently hold (personally) 0.35% of the outstanding shares of AGNCP. This AGNCP trade was disclosed to readers in real time (that day) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha. All trades/investments I have performed over the past few years have been disclosed to readers in real time (that day at the latest) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.

AGNC Investment's Q2 2017 And 7/21/2017 BV Projection (Includes MTGE And NLY BV Projection) - AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AGNC Investment's Q2 2017 And 7/21/2017 BV Projection (Includes MTGE And NLY BV Projection)Jul.24.17 | About: AGNC Investment (AGNC) Scott Kennedy Value, mREITs, BDCs, dividend investingSummaryI am projecting AGNC Investment Corp. will report a minor decrease in quarterly BV for the second quarter of 2017.This projection is mainly due to minor-to-modest net price increases in most fixed-rate agency MBS coupons offset by a modest net decrease in the company's derivatives valuation.My projections for AGNC's BV per common share as of 6/30/2017 and 7/21/2017 are stated in the "Conclusions Drawn" section of the article.My projection for MTGE Investment Corp.'s BV per common share as of 6/30/2017 is stated near the "Conclusions Drawn" section of the article. I also discuss Annaly Capital Management's estimated BV as of 6/30/2017.The continued neutral/muted relationship between MBS prices and derivative instrument valuations should be seen as a cautious catalyst/trend regarding mREIT book values and stock valuations.Focus of Article The focus of this article is to provide a detailed projection of AGNC Investment Corp.'s (NASDAQ:AGNC) book value (“BV”) per common share as of 6/30/2017. Prior to results being provided to the public on 7/26/2017 (via the company’s quarterly press release), I would like to analyze AGNC's BV as of 6/30/2017 and provide readers a general direction on how I believe this recent quarter has panned out. A previous three-part article I wrote laid the ground works for this BV projection. In that article, I projected/analyzed the company’s income statement (technically speaking, its “consolidated statement of comprehensive income") for the second quarter of 2017. The links to that three-part projection article are provided below: AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement Projection - Part 1 (Including Current Recommendation)  AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement and EPS Projection - Part 2 AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement and EPS Projection - Part 3 By understanding the trends that occurred within AGNC's operations during the second quarter of 2017, one can apply this information to sector peers as well. As such, the discussion/analysis below is not solely applicable to AGNC but to the fixed-rate agency mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) sector as a whole. This includes, but is not limited to, the following fixed-rate agency mREIT peers: 1) Arlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE:AI); 2) ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc. (NYSE:ARR); 3) Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. (NYSE:CHMI); 4) CYS Investments Inc. (NYSE:CYS); 5) Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NYSE:NLY); and 6) Orchid Island Capital Inc. (NYSE:ORC). Technically speaking, several years ago AI changed its “entity status" from a REIT to a C-Corp. per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). However, AI still maintained many “mREIT-like" characteristics, including the type of investments held by the company and the amount of annual dividend distributions paid to shareholders. 
 In addition, the following hybrid mREIT companies had at least a modest portion of each company’s MBS portfolio in fixed-rate agency MBS (also typically having higher durations): 1) Dynex Capital Inc. (NYSE:DX); 2) Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. (NYSE:IVR); 3) MFA Financial Inc. (NYSE:MFA); 4) AG Mortgage Investment Trust Inc. (NYSE:MITT); 5) MTGE Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:MTGE); 6) Two Harbors Investment Corp. (NYSE:TWO); and 7) Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corp. (NYSE:WMC). As such, the analysis below is not solely applicable to one company but more so the agency/hybrid mREIT sector as a whole. This article will also include a brief BV discussion/projection regarding AGNC's affiliate MTGE and the company’s sector peer NLY. Overview of AGNC's Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 Due to the fact that several figures needed to project/calculate AGNC’s BV as of 6/30/2017 come directly from its consolidated statements of comprehensive income, Table 1 is provided below. Table 1 shows the company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income from a three months-ended time frame. Using Table 1 below as a reference, one must add certain account figures from the first and second quarters of 2017 for purposes of projecting a suitable BV as of 6/30/2017. Table 1 - AGNC Three Months-Ended Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  



 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using data obtained from AGNC's quarterly investor presentation slides)
 Having provided Table 1 above, we can now begin to calculate its projected BV as of 6/30/2017. This projection will be calculated in Table 2 below. There will not be an identical sheet AGNC provides that matches the data within Table 2. I have gathered specific information derived from multiple tables/charts for a more detailed analysis of the company's BV as of 6/30/2017. AGNC, through its quarterly investor presentation slides (see link above), only provides the public with a “Book Value Roll Forward” slide. This specific slide uses information based only on a quarterly time frame. I perform a more detailed quarterly BV calculation/analysis based on the entire year. Table 2 - AGNC Three Months-Ended BV Projection (BV as of 6/30/2017)  

 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 2 above as a reference, let us take a look at the calculation for AGNC's projected BV as of 6/30/2017. Unless otherwise noted, all figures below are for the “six months ended” time frame. Let us take a look at the following figures in corresponding order to the “Ref.” column shown in Table 2 (next to the June 30, 2017 column): A) Operations; B) Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI/(OCL)); C) Stockholder Transactions; and D) Capital Share Transactions. A) Operations - Increase in Net Common Equity From Operations Estimate of $56 Million; Range ($194)-$306 Million  - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Red Reference “A” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column This “net increase (decrease) in net common equity from operations" figure consists of the following amounts that come directly from the company's consolidated statement of comprehensive income (see Tables 1 and 2 above): 1) net interest income; 2) total other income (loss); 3) total expenses; and 4) excise tax.
 Due to the fact I discussed these amounts in my previous three-part AGNC consolidated statement of comprehensive income projection article (see links near the top), further discussion of this figure is redundant/unwarranted. B) Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI/(OCL)) - Increase in Net Common Equity From Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) Estimate of $205 Million; Range $5-405 Million - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High  - See Red Reference “B” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column This “net increase (decrease) in net common equity from OCI/(OCL)” figure consists of the following accounts that come directly from the company's consolidated statement of comprehensive income (see Tables 1 and 2 above): 1) unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, net; and 2) unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net (upon reclassification to interest expense). Due to the fact I also discussed these accounts in my previous three-part AGNC consolidated statement of comprehensive income article (see links near the top), further discussion of this figure is redundant/unwarranted as well. C) Stockholder Transactions - Decrease in Net Common Equity From Stockholder Transactions Estimate of ($381) Million; Range ($391)-($371) Million  - Confidence Within Range = High  - See Red Reference “C” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column This “net increase (decrease) in net common equity from stockholder transactions” figure is AGNC's dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of 2017. This figure includes activity in relation to the following types of outstanding shares of stock: 1) common; and 2) preferred. 1) Common Stock Prior to projecting AGNC's common stock dividend distributions for the second quarter of 2017, let us first discuss how the number of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock could change during any given quarter. AGNC has the following four events/programs which could impact the number of outstanding shares of common stock it has when monthly dividends are declared: 1) public offering of shares (“bulk” issuance); 2) at-the-market (“ATM”) offering program; 3) dividend reinvestment/direct stock purchase program; and 4) stock repurchase program.
 On 5/2/2017, the company priced its previously announced public offering of 24.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $503 million. In addition, AGNC granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional 3.7 million shares of its common stock (within 30 days). I am projecting the underwriters' option was fully exercised. As such, I am projecting AGNC’s outstanding shares of common stock increased 28.2 million shares from its recent public offering of shares. Even though AGNC’s stock price throughout the quarter traded slightly-to-modestly above its “tangible" BV as of 3/31/2017 ($19.31 per share), I am making the assumption there was no activity within the company's ATM offering or dividend reinvestment/direct stock purchase programs during the second quarter of 2017. My reasoning is mainly due to the May 2017 equity offering described above. When it comes to AGNC’s repurchase program, this was created in October 2012 and was fairly recently amended in October 2016 to allow the company to repurchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock through 12/31/2017. As of 3/31/2017, the company had $1 billion remaining under its stock repurchase program. AGNC intends to buy back outstanding shares of common stock only when the repurchase price is materially accretive to CURRENT tangible BV. Since the stock price traded modestly-to-materially above the company’s “tangible” BV as of 3/31/2017 throughout the second quarter of 2017, I believe management did not repurchase any outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend declared on AGNC's common stock for the second quarter of 2017 totaled $0.54 per share. This was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter. When calculated, I am projecting AGNC had dividend distributions to common shareholders of ($189) million for the second quarter of 2017. When combined, I am projecting the company had dividend distributions to common shareholders of ($368) million for the six months ended 6/30/2017. Now let us project the preferred stock dividend distributions.
 2) Preferred Stock The dividend declared on AGNC’s “Series A Preferred Stock” (AGNCP) and “Series B Preferred Stock” (AGNCB) for the second quarter of 2017 was $0.50 per share and $0.484375 per depositary share, respectively. As such, this was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter. There were still 6.9 and 7.0 million outstanding shares of AGNCP and AGNCB as of 6/28/2017, respectively (ex-dividend date). When calculated, I am projecting AGNC had dividend distributions to AGNCP and AGNCB shareholders of ($3.5) and ($3.4) million for the second quarter of 2017, respectively. When combined, I am projecting the company had dividend distributions to preferred shareholders of ($13.7) million (rounded) for the six months ended 6/30/2017. After combining the common and preferred stock dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of 2017, I am projecting AGNC’s total “distributions to stockholders from estimated REIT taxable income/undistributed taxable income (“UTI”)” and decrease in net common equity from stockholder transactions was ($381) million (rounded) for the six months ended 6/30/2017 (see red reference “C” in Table 2 above). D) Capital Share Transactions - Increase in Net Common Equity From Capital Share Transactions Estimate of $555 Million; Range $475-575 Million - Confidence Within Range = High  - See Red Reference “D” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column As stated earlier, on 5/2/2017 AGNC priced its previously announced public offering of 24.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $503 million. In addition, the company granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional 3.7 million shares of its common stock (within 30 days). I am projecting the underwriters’ option was fully exercised. This calculates to additional gross proceeds of approximately $75 million. After accounting for all offering costs and the underwriters’ discount, I am projecting AGNC’s net proceeds from its May 2017 equity offering was approximately $555 million.
 In addition, I am making the assumption no additional shares of common stock were issued under its ATM offering or dividend reinvestment/direct stock purchase programs during the second quarter of 2017. Also, since there were no additional preferred stock equity offerings during the second quarter of 2017, the following figures should have no activity: 1) issuance of preferred stock; and 2) preferred stock $25,000 per share liquidation preference.  Since AGNC officially internalized its management structure through its acquisition of American Capital Mortgage Management (“ACMM”) last year, management may be partially compensated through the issuance of common stock subject to certain vesting options. As such, the company may have some minor amount of equity issuance through the following accounts: 1) issuance of restricted stock; and/or 2) issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation program. However, due to the immaterial impact such restricted stock and/or stock-based compensation would represent, I have projected no amount within these two accounts during the second quarter of 2017. Any actual amount of restricted stock and/or stock-based compensation during the second quarter of 2017 (through the issuance of new shares) would only have a fractional per share impact on its BV as of 6/30/2017.   Regarding AGNC’s “repurchases of common stock” figure, as stated earlier, I am making the assumption management did not purchase any outstanding shares of common stock under its stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2017. Therefore, I am projecting the company had a “net common equity from capital share transactions” figure of $555 million for the six months ended 6/30/2017 (see red reference “D” in Table 2 above). MTGE’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 When compared to AGNC, I am projecting MTGE had a slightly more favorable BV per share fluctuation (percentage-wise) for the second quarter of 2017. Each company’s agency MBS and derivatives portfolios as of 3/31/2017 had several similarities, which were discussed in my three-part AGNC income statement projection article (see links near the top). However, it should also be noted MTGE had a much larger non-agency MBS portfolio (with an attractive cost basis) and has recently “branched out” to invest in skilled nursing facilities and seniors housing. In comparison, AGNC has a very minor investment in AAA non-agency MBS and no exposure to the healthcare sector.
 When taking all quarterly activities into consideration (including additional data not discussed within this specific article), I am projecting MTGE will report the following BV per common share as of 6/30/2017: MTGE’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 = $19.55 Per Common Share (Range $19.05-20.05 Per Common Share) NLY’s BV as of 6/30/2017 As was highlighted in my three-part AGNC income statement projection article (see links near the top of this article), I discussed several differences between AGNC’s and NLY’s investment portfolio. Furthermore, it was discussed each company had a different strategy regarding derivative instruments going into the second quarter of 2017 (most notably the difference between each company’s hedging coverage ratio as of 3/31/2017). Simply put, NLY’s lower hedging coverage ratio at the start of the second quarter of 2017 was an advantage for the company when compared to AGNC. In addition, it should also be noted management has recently broadened NLY’s investment portfolio by allocating more capital into commercial debt/real estate, preferred equity, corporate debt, and most recently middle market (“MM”) lending. Furthermore, NLY recently acquired a variable-rate agency mREIT, Hatteras Financial Corp. (NYSE:HTS). Generally speaking these asset classes, when compared to fixed-rate agency MBS, performed similarly during the second quarter of 2017. On 7/17/2017, along with NLY’s announcement of a July 2017 equity offering, the company provided preliminary results to the public regarding its second quarter of 2017. Along with several other operating performance metrics, it announced an estimated BV as of 6/30/2017 of $11.19 per common share. Within the following MBS pricing article dated 6/20/2017, I projected NLY’s BV as of 6/16/2017 was $11.30 per common share (when INCLUDING the quarterly dividend accrual of $0.30 per common share, which had yet to occur as of 6/16/2017; the ex dividend date was 6/28/2017): Annaly Capital And CYS Investments: MBS Pricing For Q2 2017 (Includes Current BV Projections)
 Due to the negative relationship that existed between most MBS prices and derivative instrument valuations during the last two weeks of the quarter, I projected NLY’s BV as of 6/30/2017 was $11.20 per common share (prior to management providing quarterly results; several readers privately asked for my projection, which I provided as support). As such, I believe its preliminary estimated BV as of 6/30/2017 was basically an exact match to my projected BV. NLY’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 (Prior to Management’s Disclosure of Preliminary Results on 7/17/2017) = $11.20 Per Common Share (Range $10.80-11.40 Per Common Share) NLY’s Estimated BV as of 6/30/2017 Per Management’s Disclosure of Preliminary Results on 7/17/2017 = $11.19 Per Common Share Conclusions Drawn To sum up all the information discussed above, I am projecting AGNC will report the following BV per common share as of 6/30/2017: AGNC’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 = $20.72 Per Common Share (Range $20.22-21.22 Per Common Share)  This projection is a ($0.26) per common share decrease from its BV as of 3/31/2017. This minor decrease can be attributed to two factors. The first factor is in relation to the activity within the company's consolidated statement of comprehensive income. I am projecting AGNC will report a net loss of ($20) million for the second quarter of 2017, while reporting OCI of $159 million. When both figures are combined, I am projecting AGNC will report comprehensive income of $139 million for the second quarter of 2017. The second factor is in relation to the activity within AGNC’s equity section of the balance sheet. The company paid for/accrued dividend distributions totaling ($0.54) per common share during the second quarter of 2017. In addition, it paid for/accrued dividend distributions in regard to holders of the company's outstanding shares of preferred stock. Furthermore, AGNC's May 2017 equity offering resulted in some minor dilution. When combined, these two factors account for a projected quarterly BV decrease of ($0.26) per common share. When calculated, I am projecting AGNC’s BV per common share had a decrease of (1.24%) during the second quarter of 2017. I am also projecting the company generated an “economic return” (dividends paid/accrued for and net change in BV) of 1.37% for the second quarter of 2017. 
 Similar to the prior quarter, there was a more “neutral/muted” relationship between MBS prices and derivative instrument valuations during the second quarter of 2017 (“option adjusted spreads”, or OAS).  As such, I believe most mREIT peers will report only a minor (less than 5%) fluctuation in quarterly BV. With that being said, I believe most mREIT stock prices have already “priced in” this more neutral/muted relationship when it comes to sector valuations.  I believe four key factors to analyze within the fixed-rate agency mREIT sector this quarter are the following: 1) each company’s proportion of 15-year MBS holdings versus 30-year MBS holdings; 2) each company’s hedging coverage ratio; 3) each company’s proportion of long-term derivative instruments versus short-term derivative instruments; and 4) each company’s proportion of specified pools (for instance HARP and LLB securities). Dependent upon these factors, I believe results will slightly vary across most of the fixed-rate agency mREIT sector for the second quarter of 2017. Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2017, mortgage interest rates first increased and then recently have reversed course (through 7/21/2017). The fixed-pay rate on interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury yields have also seen the same trend through 7/21/2017 (when compared to 6/30/2017) . However, the forward LIBOR curve has remained relatively unchanged.  In addition, it should be noted the relationship between agency MBS pricing and derivative instrument valuations has been slightly positive through the first three weeks of July (minor tightening of spreads).  Through a detailed analysis that will be omitted from this particular article, I am projecting AGNC’s BV as of 7/21/2017 has fluctuated between ($0.10) and $0.30 per common share when compared to the company’s BV as of 6/30/2017. This projection excludes the July 2017 monthly dividend of $0.18 per common share (ex-dividend is 7/27/2017). My BUY, SELL, or HOLD Recommendation From the analysis provided above, including additional catalysts/factors not discussed within this particular article, I currently rate AGNC as a SELL when I believe the company’s stock price is trading at less than a (2.5%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017, a HOLD when trading at or greater than a (2.5%) but less than a (10.0%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017, and a BUY when trading at or greater than a (10.0%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017. These ranges are unchanged when compared to PART 1 of my income statement projection article (approximately three weeks ago).
 Therefore, I currently rate AGNC as a SELL (however, fairly close to my HOLD range), since the stock is trading at less than a (2.5%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017. My current price target for AGNC is approximately $20.25 per share. This is currently the price where my recommendation would change to a HOLD. The current price where my recommendation would change to a BUY is approximately $18.65 per share.       Along with the data presented within this article, this recommendation considers the following mREIT catalysts/factors: 1) projected future MBS price movements; 2) projected future derivative valuations; and 3) projected near-term dividend per share rates. This recommendation also considers the high probability of multiple Federal (“Fed”) Funds Rate increases by the FOMC during 2017-2018 (this is a more hawkish view when compared to most of last year) due to recent macroeconomic trends/events. This also considers the eventual “wind-down” of the Fed’s balance sheet.   Final Note: Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each reader’s current investing strategy. The factual information provided within this article is intended to help assist readers when it comes to investing strategies/decisions.   During January-March 2014, I initiated (and subsequently add to) a position in MTGE at a weighted average purchase price of $18.47 per share. On 3/4/2016 and 4/8/2016, I directly increased my position in the stock at a weighted average purchase price of $14.36 and $14.47 per share, respectively. These two combined purchases had the same approximate monetary value of my combined 2014 purchases. My entire MTGE position had a weighted average purchase price of $16.443 per share. On 6/15/2017, I sold my entire MTGE position at a weighted average price of $19.09 per share, as my price target of $19.10 was met that day.

MTGE Investment Corp. Declares First Quarter Dividend On Its Series A Preferred Stock


Mar 16, 2017 5:00 PM EDT









This Stock Has A 11.08% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

AGNC Investment's Q2 2017 Income Statement And EPS Projection - Part 3 - AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AGNC Investment's Q2 2017 Income Statement And EPS Projection - Part 3Jul.20.17 | About: AGNC Investment (AGNC) Scott Kennedy Value, mREITs, BDCs, dividend investingSummaryI am projecting AGNC will report a modest net unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities for the second quarter of 2017.This is due to the fact most 15- and 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS coupons had minor-modest net price increases during the second quarter of 2017.This three-part article also highlights to readers the heightened importance of understanding the relationship between AGNC’s derivatives portfolio and the company’s MBS portfolio regarding changes in quarterly valuations.My projection for AGNC’s comprehensive income for the second quarter of 2017 is stated in the “Conclusions Drawn” section.AGNC’s quarterly results are mainly a result of the “relatively neutral” relationship between fixed-rate agency MBS prices and most derivative instrument valuations during the second quarter of 2017.Author’s Note: PART 3 of this article is a continuation from PART 1 and PART 2 which were discussed in previous publications. Please see PART 1 and PART 2 of this article for a detailed projection of AGNC Investment Corp.’s (AGNC) income statement (technically speaking, the company’s “consolidated statement of comprehensive income”) for the second quarter of 2017 regarding the following accounts: 1) interest income; 2) interest expense; 3) gain (loss) on sale of agency securities, net; and 4) gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net (including four “sub-accounts”). PART 2 also discussed AGNC’s projected net loss and earnings per share (“EPS”) amounts. PART 1 and PART 2 help lead to a better understanding of the topics and analysis that will be discussed in PART 3. The links to PART 1 and PART 2 are provided below: AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement Projection - Part 1 (Including Current Recommendation)  AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement and EPS Projection - Part 2 Focus of Article: The focus of PART 3 of this article is to provide a detailed projection of AGNC’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the second quarter of 2017 regarding the following accounts: 5a) “unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities measured at fair market value (“FMV”) through net income, net;” and 5b) “unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, net.” PART 3 will also discuss AGNC’s projected other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI/(OCL)) and comprehensive income (loss) amounts. For readers who just want the summarized account projections, I would suggest to scroll down to the “Conclusions Drawn” section at the bottom of the article.
 By understanding the trends that occurred within AGNC’s operations during the second quarter of 2017, one can apply this information to sector peers as well. As such, the discussion/analysis below is not solely applicable to AGNC but to the fixed-rate agency mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) sector as a whole. This includes, but is not limited to, the following fixed-rate agency mREIT peers: 1) Arlington Asset Investment Corp. (AI); 2) ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. (ARR); 3) Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. (CHMI); 4) CYS Investments, Inc. (CYS); 5) Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NLY); and 6) Orchid Island Capital Inc. (ORC). In particular, PART 3 provides a discussion of fixed-rate agency MBS price movements which all of the sector peers listed above are currently heavily invested in. Technically speaking, several years ago AI changed its “entity status” from a REIT to a C-Corp. per the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). However, AI still maintained many “mREIT-like” characteristics including the type of investments held by the company and the amount of annual dividend distributions paid to shareholders. In addition, the following hybrid mREIT companies had at least a modest portion of each company’s MBS portfolio in fixed-rate agency MBS (also typically having higher durations): 1) Dynex Capital Inc. (DX); 2) Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. (IVR); 3) MFA Financial, Inc. (MFA); 4) AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc. (MITT); 5) MTGE Investment Corp. (MTGE); 6) Two Harbors Investment Corp. (TWO); and 7) Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corp. (WMC). As such, the analysis below is not solely applicable to one company but more so the agency/hybrid mREIT sector as a whole. 5a) Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investment Securities Measured at FMV Through Net Income, Net: - Estimate of $25 Million; Range ($75)–125 Million  - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Boxed Blue Reference “5a” in Tables 8 and 9 Below Next to the June 30, 2017, Column  AGNC’s unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities measured at FMV through net income, net account was recently created by the company due to a change in accounting treatment of its MBS portfolio. All unrealized FMV fluctuations on MBS acquired on or after 1/1/2017 are now recognized within this account. All unrealized FMV fluctuations on MBS acquired prior to 1/1/2017 continue to be recognized in the account described next. Since this is merely a “classification” change, AGNC’s entire MBS portfolio is discussed/analyzed in the next account (even though a portion of the portfolio is reclassified to the account described here).
 5b) Unrealized Gain (Loss) on AFS Securities, Net: - Estimate of $159 Million; Range $34–284 Million  - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Boxed Blue Reference “6” in Table 8 Below Next to the June 30, 2017, Column  Projecting AGNC’s unrealized gain (loss) unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities, net account is an analysis that includes several assumptions and variables that need to be taken into consideration. Since this account is the summation of the quarterly unrealized valuation changes within AGNC’s MBS portfolio (by far the largest asset class on the company’s balance sheet), a wider projection range should be accompanied with this specific account. The same assumptions used within AGNC’s gain (loss) on sale of agency securities, net account (see PART 1 of article) and gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net account (regarding the company’s TBA MBS position; see PART 2 of article) will be applied when discussing this account. Prior to performing an account projection analysis, let us first analyze the fixed-rate agency MBS price movements during the second quarter of 2017. Using Table 6 below as a reference, let us first analyze the 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements. This will then be followed by a similar analysis (via Table 7) of the 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements. By doing so, this will help readers understand how I come up with my projected valuations discussed later in the article. Table 6 – 15-Year Fixed-Rate Agency MBS Price Movements (Q2 2017) 

 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, using MBS pricing data via private access to a professional resource [Thomson Reuters]) Table 6 above shows the 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements during the second quarter of 2017. It breaks out these agency MBS holdings by “government-sponsored enterprise/entity” (“GSE”). This includes both Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) MBS. As of 3/31/2017, AGNC’s Ginnie Mae holdings accounted for less than 1% of the company’s MBS portfolio (excluding TBA MBS positions). As such, Ginnie Mae fixed-rate agency MBS price movements are deemed immaterial for discussion purposes and thus excluded from this table. Table 6 further breaks out the 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements into the various coupons on AGNC’s books ranging from 2.5-4.0%. AGNC currently holds an immaterial balance over the 4.0% coupon and thus these specific coupons are excluded from Table 6 above.
 From the information provided in Table 6, a valuation gain (loss) can be calculated which is broken down by the various coupons. It should also be noted AGNC continually changes the company’s MBS portfolio in any given quarter. As such, I must determine specific purchase and sale assumptions towards the end of my account projection analysis. Using Table 6 above as a reference, let us look at the 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements regarding coupon rates where AGNC held a material balance as of 3/31/2017. The cumulative quarterly net MBS price movements for each coupon rate are shown within Table 6 under the “Cumulative Quarterly Change” column. For example, during the second quarter of 2017, a Fannie 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS with a 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, and 4.0% coupon had a cumulative quarterly price increase (decrease) of 0.42, 0.06, (0.06), and 0.11 to settle its price at 100.47, 102.59, 104.00, and 103.39, respectively. As such, a modest price increase occurred on the 2.5% coupon while a minor price fluctuation occurred on the 3.0%, 3.5%, and 4.0% coupons.   When compared to Fannie 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS, Freddie 15-year fixed-rate agency with a 3.0%, 3.5% and 4.0% coupon had slight differences (or no difference) in cumulative net price valuations. However, there was a more notable difference when it came to the 2.5% coupon. Now that we have an understanding of the 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements during the second quarter of 2017, let us take a look at the 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements. Table 7 – 30-Year Fixed-Rate Agency MBS Price Movements (Q2 2017) 

 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, using MBS pricing data via private access to a professional resource [Thomson Reuters]; link provided below Table 6])
 Table 7 above shows the 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements during the second quarter of 2017. It breaks out these MBS holdings by GSE as well. As stated earlier, AGNC’s Ginnie Mae fixed-rate agency MBS holdings are deemed immaterial for discussion purposes and are excluded from this table. Table 7 further breaks out the 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements into the various coupons on AGNC’s books ranging from 3.0-4.5%. AGNC holds an immaterial balance over the 4.5% coupon and thus these specific coupons are excluded from Table 7 above. From the information provided in Table 7, a valuation gain (loss) can be calculated which is broken down by the various coupons. Using Table 7 above as a reference, let us look at the 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements regarding coupon rates where AGNC held a material balance as of 3/31/2017. For example, during the second quarter of 2017, a Fannie 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS with a 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, and 4.5% coupon had a cumulative quarterly price increase of 0.64, 0.33, 0.16, and 0.00 to settle its price at 99.83, 102.67, 105.09, and 107.23, respectively. As such, a modest price increase occurred on the 3.0% and 3.5% coupons, a minor price increase occurred on the 4.0% coupon, and no price fluctuation occurred on the 4.5% coupon. When compared to Fannie 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS, Freddie 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS with similar coupons had slight differences in cumulative net price fluctuations. Now that we have an understanding of the 15- and 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements during the second quarter of 2017, let us take a look at how I believe these price movements impacted AGNC’s MBS portfolio. I am projecting an “initial” net valuation gain of $100 million regarding AGNC’s 15- and 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS holdings for the second quarter of 2017. However, as stated earlier, several other adjustments need to be performed within AGNC’s unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities, net account before a final projection can be made. Since AGNC had a portion of the company’s fixed-rate agency MBS holdings within “specified pools” (prepayment protected MBS; mainly through the Home Affordable Refinance Program [HARP] and low-loan balance [LLB] securities), a quarterly valuation adjustment needs to be calculated. Through a detailed calculation that will be omitted from this particular article (data/support in relation to AGNC’s specified pools is beyond a “free to the public” article), I am projecting AGNC had an additional net valuation gain of $19 million for the second quarter of 2017 in regards to the company’s specified pools. When these two figures are combined, I am projecting AGNC had a net valuation gain of $119 on the company’s 15- and 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS portfolio.
 In addition, through a detailed calculation that will be omitted from this particular article, I am projecting AGNC had a net valuation gain of $20 million during the second quarter of 2017 in regards to the following MBS holdings: 1) 20-year fixed-rate; 2) collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”); 3) adjustable-rate mortgages (“ARM”); 4) credit risk transfers (“CRT”); and 5) AAA non-agency. Also, when considering the impacts of an assumed partial conversion of AGNC’s net long TBA MBS position and the company’s realignment of its MBS portfolio throughout the quarter, I am projecting a net valuation loss adjustment of ($5) million for the second quarter of 2017. Therefore, when all the figures stated above are combined, I am projecting a total net valuation gain of $134 million on AGNC’s MBS portfolio for the second quarter of 2017. This figure is PRIOR to all sold MBS being reversed out in the current quarter (discussed in PART 1 of the article) and the reclassification of all unrealized gains (losses) regarding MBS purchased after 1/1/2017. These two reversals are shown in Table 8 below. Table 8- AGNC Quarterly Unrealized Gain (Loss) on AFS Securities, Net Projection 

 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using AGNC data obtained from the SEC’s EDGAR Database) Table 8 above shows AGNC’s projected total net valuation gain of $134 million on the company’s MBS portfolio (see red reference “AB” in Table 8 above). This amount is highlighted in teal. The second amount shown is AGNC’s projected “reversal of prior period unrealized (“gain”) loss, net, (upon realization)” figure (see red reference “AC” in Table 8 above). This amount is highlighted in pink. The third amount shown is AGNC’s projected “reversal of unrealized (“gain”) loss on investment securities measured at FMV through net income, net” figure (see red reference “AD” in Table 8 above). This amount is highlighted in dark teal.
 Therefore, after AGNC’s projected net realized loss on the sale of agency securities of $50 million and net unrealized gain on investment securities measured at FMV through net income of ($25) million is reversed out, the company’s total net unrealized gain on AFS securities is projected to be $159 million for the second quarter of 2017 (see red reference “(AB + AC + AD) = AE” in Table 8 above). This amount is highlighted in grey. Brief Discussion of MTGE’s and NLY’s Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Agency Securities, Net Account: I see general similarities between AGNC and the company’s affiliate MTGE regarding agency MBS portfolio strategies. As such, I see a fairly similar projection between AGNC’s unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities, net account and MTGE’s “unrealized gain (loss) on agency securities, net” account for the second quarter of 2017 (proportionally speaking). With that being said, when compared to AGNC, MTGE had a slightly higher proportional share of 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS holdings as of 3/31/2017 which needs to be considered regarding projected valuations. Furthermore, one should consider that AGNC likely “deployed” at least some of the company’s newly raised capital from its May 2017 equity offering during the quarter. In addition, MTGE also had a much larger non-agency MBS portfolio (proportionately speaking). Due to this fact, MTGE also has an “unrealized gain (loss) on non-agency securities, net” account that needs to be incorporated into the company’s financials. MTGE's non-agency MBS portfolio has different valuation methods which are mainly based on specific indexes and simulated models which are classified as level 3 assets per Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820. This includes, but is not limited to, prime, CRT, Alt-A, option ARM, and subprime holdings. MTGE’s non-agency MBS portfolio had a conditional prepayment rate (“CPR”) of 14%, a conditional default rate (“CDR”) of 3%, and a voluntary prepayment rate (“VPR”) of 12% as of 3/31/2017. I anticipate a relatively flat-minor increase to these three metrics during the second quarter of 2017 which would slightly impact valuations. Further discussion of MTGE’s non-agency MBS portfolio is beyond the scope of this article.
 When it comes to AGNC’s sector peer NLY, I see one modest difference that would impact the account described above. As of 3/31/2017, only 9% of NLY’s fixed-rate agency MBS portfolio consisted of 15-year maturities whereas AGNC had 26% of the company’s MBS portfolio in 15-year maturities (excluding TBA MBS positions). Since most 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS coupons had additional price increases when compared to 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS with similar coupons, NLY should have a slightly higher combined total net valuation gain on AFS securities (realized and unrealized) when compared to AGNC during the second quarter of 2017 (proportionally speaking). In addition, it should also be noted management has recently broadened NLY’s investment portfolio by allocating more capital into commercial debt/real estate, preferred equity, corporate debt, and most recently middle market (“MM”) lending. Furthermore, NLY recently acquired a variable-rate agency mREIT, Hatteras Financial Corp. (HTS). Generally speaking, most of these asset classes, when compared to fixed-rate agency MBS, also experienced relatively flat-minor price increases during the second quarter of 2017. A further discussion of NLY’s MBS/investment portfolio is beyond the scope of this article. B) Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI/(OCL)): - Estimate of $159 Million; Range ($41)–359 Million  - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High  - See Red Reference “B” in Table 9 Below Next to the June 30, 2017, Column  Let us now take a look at AGNC's projected OCI/(OCL) and comprehensive income (loss) amounts. This information is provided in Table 9 below. Table 9 – AGNC Quarterly OCI/(OCL) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) Projection 


 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using data obtained from AGNC's quarterly investor presentation slides) After combining the company’s net unrealized gain on AFS securities of $159 million and its net unrealized gain on interest rate swaps (upon reclassification) of $0, I am projecting AGNC will report OCI of $159 million for the second quarter of 2017 (see red reference “B” in Table 9 above). C) Comprehensive Income (Loss): - Estimate of $139 Million; Range ($61)–339 Million  - Comprehensive Income Available to Common Shareholders of $0.38 Per Share; Range ($0.20)–0.96 Per Share - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High  - See Red Reference “C” in Table 9 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column  Finally, let us look at AGNC’s comprehensive income for the second quarter of 2017. This is the summation of the following amounts: A) net loss of ($20) million (see PART 1 and PART 2); and B) OCI of $159 million (see analysis above). Therefore, when these two amounts are combined, I am projecting AGNC will report comprehensive income of $139 million for the second quarter of 2017. Conclusions Drawn From PART 1, PART 2, and PART 3:  To sum up the analysis from all three parts of the article, I am projecting AGNC will report the following amounts for the second quarter of 2017: A) Quarterly Net Loss of ($20) Million; Earnings Available to Common Shareholders of ($0.08) Per Share B) Quarterly OCI of $159 Million C) Quarterly Comprehensive Income (A and B Combined) of $139 Million; Comprehensive Income Available to Common Shareholders of $0.38 Per Share  AGNC’s projected net loss of ($20) million for the second quarter of 2017 is a minor decrease when compared to net income of $76 million for the first quarter of 2017. This is mainly due to AGNC’s projected net valuation loss of ($184) million regarding the company’s derivatives portfolio for the second quarter of 2017. For the same account in the prior quarter, AGNC recognized a net valuation loss of only ($40) million.
 I am also projecting AGNC will report OCI of $139 million for the second quarter of 2017. This projected amount is a very minor increase when compared to OCI of $122 million for the first quarter of 2017. I believe AGNC will slightly underperform the fixed-rate agency mREIT peer average in regards to valuation fluctuations for the second quarter of 2017. This is mainly due to AGNC’s higher hedging coverage ratio and the composition of the company’s MBS portfolio heading into the second quarter of 2017 when compared to its fixed-rate agency mREIT peers. I believe four key factors to analyze within the fixed-rate agency mREIT sector this quarter are the following: 1) each company’s proportion of 15-year MBS holdings versus 30-year MBS holdings; 2) each company’s hedging coverage ratio; 3) each company’s proportion of long-term derivative instruments versus short-term derivative instruments; and 4) each company’s proportion of specified pools (for instance HARP and LLB securities). Dependent upon these factors, I believe results will modestly vary across the fixed-rate agency mREIT sector for the second quarter of 2017. My BUY, SELL, or HOLD Recommendation: For my AGNC BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation, please see PART 1 of this article (link provided at the beginning of the article).  Final Note: The projected amounts from this three-part article will have a direct impact on AGNC’s projected book value (“BV”) as of 6/30/2017. My upcoming AGNC BV projection article will be available to readers prior to the company’s earnings press release for the second quarter of 2017 on 7/26/2017. Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each reader’s current investing strategy. The factual information provided within this article is intended to help assist readers when it comes to investing strategies/decisions.   During January-March 2014, I initiated (and subsequently add to) a position in MTGE at a weighted average purchase price of $18.47 per share. On 3/4/2016 and 4/8/2016, I directly increased my position in MTGE at a weighted average purchase price of $14.36 and $14.47 per share, respectively. These two combined purchases had the same approximate monetary value of my combined 2014 purchases. My entire MTGE position had a weighted average purchase price of $16.443 per share. On 6/15/2017, I sold my entire MTGE position at a weighted average price of $19.09 per share as my price target of $19.10 was met that day. My MTGE total return (when including change in stock price and dividends received/gains on reinvested dividends), was 45.4%. My 2016 purchases were disclosed, at the time, to readers in subsequent AGNC articles over the following several months. My 2017 sale was disclosed to readers in “real time” (that day) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.
 On 11/27/2015, I initiated a position in AGNCB; Series B preferred stock. On 12/7/2015, 12/9/2015, 12/14/2015, 1/14/2016, and 1/20/2016 I selectively increased my position in AGNCB. When combined, my AGNCB position has a weighted average purchase price of $23.215 per share. This weighted average per share price excludes all dividends received/reinvested. I currently hold (personally and through affiliated entities) 0.71% of the outstanding shares of AGNCB. Each AGNCB trade was disclosed to readers in real time (that day) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.     All trades/investments I have performed over the past few years have been disclosed to readers in real time (that day at the latest) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.

(NASDAQ:AGNC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AGNC Investment's Q2 2017 Income Statement And EPS Projection - Part 3Jul.20.17 | About: AGNC Investment (AGNC) Scott Kennedy Value, mREITs, BDCs, dividend investingSummaryI am projecting AGNC will report a modest net unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities for the second quarter of 2017.This is due to the fact most 15- and 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS coupons had minor-modest net price increases during the second quarter of 2017.This three-part article also highlights to readers the heightened importance of understanding the relationship between AGNC’s derivatives portfolio and the company’s MBS portfolio regarding changes in quarterly valuations.My projection for AGNC’s comprehensive income for the second quarter of 2017 is stated in the “Conclusions Drawn” section.AGNC’s quarterly results are mainly a result of the “relatively neutral” relationship between fixed-rate agency MBS prices and most derivative instrument valuations during the second quarter of 2017.Author’s Note: PART 3 of this article is a continuation from PART 1 and PART 2 which were discussed in previous publications. Please see PART 1 and PART 2 of this article for a detailed projection of AGNC Investment Corp.’s (AGNC) income statement (technically speaking, the company’s “consolidated statement of comprehensive income”) for the second quarter of 2017 regarding the following accounts: 1) interest income; 2) interest expense; 3) gain (loss) on sale of agency securities, net; and 4) gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net (including four “sub-accounts”). PART 2 also discussed AGNC’s projected net loss and earnings per share (“EPS”) amounts. PART 1 and PART 2 help lead to a better understanding of the topics and analysis that will be discussed in PART 3. The links to PART 1 and PART 2 are provided below: AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement Projection - Part 1 (Including Current Recommendation)  AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement and EPS Projection - Part 2 Focus of Article: The focus of PART 3 of this article is to provide a detailed projection of AGNC’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the second quarter of 2017 regarding the following accounts: 5a) “unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities measured at fair market value (“FMV”) through net income, net;” and 5b) “unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, net.” PART 3 will also discuss AGNC’s projected other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI/(OCL)) and comprehensive income (loss) amounts. For readers who just want the summarized account projections, I would suggest to scroll down to the “Conclusions Drawn” section at the bottom of the article.
 By understanding the trends that occurred within AGNC’s operations during the second quarter of 2017, one can apply this information to sector peers as well. As such, the discussion/analysis below is not solely applicable to AGNC but to the fixed-rate agency mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) sector as a whole. This includes, but is not limited to, the following fixed-rate agency mREIT peers: 1) Arlington Asset Investment Corp. (AI); 2) ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. (ARR); 3) Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. (CHMI); 4) CYS Investments, Inc. (CYS); 5) Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NLY); and 6) Orchid Island Capital Inc. (ORC). In particular, PART 3 provides a discussion of fixed-rate agency MBS price movements which all of the sector peers listed above are currently heavily invested in. Technically speaking, several years ago AI changed its “entity status” from a REIT to a C-Corp. per the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). However, AI still maintained many “mREIT-like” characteristics including the type of investments held by the company and the amount of annual dividend distributions paid to shareholders. In addition, the following hybrid mREIT companies had at least a modest portion of each company’s MBS portfolio in fixed-rate agency MBS (also typically having higher durations): 1) Dynex Capital Inc. (DX); 2) Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. (IVR); 3) MFA Financial, Inc. (MFA); 4) AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc. (MITT); 5) MTGE Investment Corp. (MTGE); 6) Two Harbors Investment Corp. (TWO); and 7) Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corp. (WMC). As such, the analysis below is not solely applicable to one company but more so the agency/hybrid mREIT sector as a whole. 5a) Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investment Securities Measured at FMV Through Net Income, Net: - Estimate of $25 Million; Range ($75)–125 Million  - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Boxed Blue Reference “5a” in Tables 8 and 9 Below Next to the June 30, 2017, Column  AGNC’s unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities measured at FMV through net income, net account was recently created by the company due to a change in accounting treatment of its MBS portfolio. All unrealized FMV fluctuations on MBS acquired on or after 1/1/2017 are now recognized within this account. All unrealized FMV fluctuations on MBS acquired prior to 1/1/2017 continue to be recognized in the account described next. Since this is merely a “classification” change, AGNC’s entire MBS portfolio is discussed/analyzed in the next account (even though a portion of the portfolio is reclassified to the account described here).
 5b) Unrealized Gain (Loss) on AFS Securities, Net: - Estimate of $159 Million; Range $34–284 Million  - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Boxed Blue Reference “6” in Table 8 Below Next to the June 30, 2017, Column  Projecting AGNC’s unrealized gain (loss) unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities, net account is an analysis that includes several assumptions and variables that need to be taken into consideration. Since this account is the summation of the quarterly unrealized valuation changes within AGNC’s MBS portfolio (by far the largest asset class on the company’s balance sheet), a wider projection range should be accompanied with this specific account. The same assumptions used within AGNC’s gain (loss) on sale of agency securities, net account (see PART 1 of article) and gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net account (regarding the company’s TBA MBS position; see PART 2 of article) will be applied when discussing this account. Prior to performing an account projection analysis, let us first analyze the fixed-rate agency MBS price movements during the second quarter of 2017. Using Table 6 below as a reference, let us first analyze the 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements. This will then be followed by a similar analysis (via Table 7) of the 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements. By doing so, this will help readers understand how I come up with my projected valuations discussed later in the article. Table 6 – 15-Year Fixed-Rate Agency MBS Price Movements (Q2 2017) 

 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, using MBS pricing data via private access to a professional resource [Thomson Reuters]) Table 6 above shows the 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements during the second quarter of 2017. It breaks out these agency MBS holdings by “government-sponsored enterprise/entity” (“GSE”). This includes both Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) MBS. As of 3/31/2017, AGNC’s Ginnie Mae holdings accounted for less than 1% of the company’s MBS portfolio (excluding TBA MBS positions). As such, Ginnie Mae fixed-rate agency MBS price movements are deemed immaterial for discussion purposes and thus excluded from this table. Table 6 further breaks out the 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements into the various coupons on AGNC’s books ranging from 2.5-4.0%. AGNC currently holds an immaterial balance over the 4.0% coupon and thus these specific coupons are excluded from Table 6 above.
 From the information provided in Table 6, a valuation gain (loss) can be calculated which is broken down by the various coupons. It should also be noted AGNC continually changes the company’s MBS portfolio in any given quarter. As such, I must determine specific purchase and sale assumptions towards the end of my account projection analysis. Using Table 6 above as a reference, let us look at the 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements regarding coupon rates where AGNC held a material balance as of 3/31/2017. The cumulative quarterly net MBS price movements for each coupon rate are shown within Table 6 under the “Cumulative Quarterly Change” column. For example, during the second quarter of 2017, a Fannie 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS with a 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, and 4.0% coupon had a cumulative quarterly price increase (decrease) of 0.42, 0.06, (0.06), and 0.11 to settle its price at 100.47, 102.59, 104.00, and 103.39, respectively. As such, a modest price increase occurred on the 2.5% coupon while a minor price fluctuation occurred on the 3.0%, 3.5%, and 4.0% coupons.   When compared to Fannie 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS, Freddie 15-year fixed-rate agency with a 3.0%, 3.5% and 4.0% coupon had slight differences (or no difference) in cumulative net price valuations. However, there was a more notable difference when it came to the 2.5% coupon. Now that we have an understanding of the 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements during the second quarter of 2017, let us take a look at the 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements. Table 7 – 30-Year Fixed-Rate Agency MBS Price Movements (Q2 2017) 

 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, using MBS pricing data via private access to a professional resource [Thomson Reuters]; link provided below Table 6])
 Table 7 above shows the 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements during the second quarter of 2017. It breaks out these MBS holdings by GSE as well. As stated earlier, AGNC’s Ginnie Mae fixed-rate agency MBS holdings are deemed immaterial for discussion purposes and are excluded from this table. Table 7 further breaks out the 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements into the various coupons on AGNC’s books ranging from 3.0-4.5%. AGNC holds an immaterial balance over the 4.5% coupon and thus these specific coupons are excluded from Table 7 above. From the information provided in Table 7, a valuation gain (loss) can be calculated which is broken down by the various coupons. Using Table 7 above as a reference, let us look at the 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements regarding coupon rates where AGNC held a material balance as of 3/31/2017. For example, during the second quarter of 2017, a Fannie 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS with a 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, and 4.5% coupon had a cumulative quarterly price increase of 0.64, 0.33, 0.16, and 0.00 to settle its price at 99.83, 102.67, 105.09, and 107.23, respectively. As such, a modest price increase occurred on the 3.0% and 3.5% coupons, a minor price increase occurred on the 4.0% coupon, and no price fluctuation occurred on the 4.5% coupon. When compared to Fannie 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS, Freddie 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS with similar coupons had slight differences in cumulative net price fluctuations. Now that we have an understanding of the 15- and 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS price movements during the second quarter of 2017, let us take a look at how I believe these price movements impacted AGNC’s MBS portfolio. I am projecting an “initial” net valuation gain of $100 million regarding AGNC’s 15- and 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS holdings for the second quarter of 2017. However, as stated earlier, several other adjustments need to be performed within AGNC’s unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities, net account before a final projection can be made. Since AGNC had a portion of the company’s fixed-rate agency MBS holdings within “specified pools” (prepayment protected MBS; mainly through the Home Affordable Refinance Program [HARP] and low-loan balance [LLB] securities), a quarterly valuation adjustment needs to be calculated. Through a detailed calculation that will be omitted from this particular article (data/support in relation to AGNC’s specified pools is beyond a “free to the public” article), I am projecting AGNC had an additional net valuation gain of $19 million for the second quarter of 2017 in regards to the company’s specified pools. When these two figures are combined, I am projecting AGNC had a net valuation gain of $119 on the company’s 15- and 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS portfolio.
 In addition, through a detailed calculation that will be omitted from this particular article, I am projecting AGNC had a net valuation gain of $20 million during the second quarter of 2017 in regards to the following MBS holdings: 1) 20-year fixed-rate; 2) collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”); 3) adjustable-rate mortgages (“ARM”); 4) credit risk transfers (“CRT”); and 5) AAA non-agency. Also, when considering the impacts of an assumed partial conversion of AGNC’s net long TBA MBS position and the company’s realignment of its MBS portfolio throughout the quarter, I am projecting a net valuation loss adjustment of ($5) million for the second quarter of 2017. Therefore, when all the figures stated above are combined, I am projecting a total net valuation gain of $134 million on AGNC’s MBS portfolio for the second quarter of 2017. This figure is PRIOR to all sold MBS being reversed out in the current quarter (discussed in PART 1 of the article) and the reclassification of all unrealized gains (losses) regarding MBS purchased after 1/1/2017. These two reversals are shown in Table 8 below. Table 8- AGNC Quarterly Unrealized Gain (Loss) on AFS Securities, Net Projection 

 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using AGNC data obtained from the SEC’s EDGAR Database) Table 8 above shows AGNC’s projected total net valuation gain of $134 million on the company’s MBS portfolio (see red reference “AB” in Table 8 above). This amount is highlighted in teal. The second amount shown is AGNC’s projected “reversal of prior period unrealized (“gain”) loss, net, (upon realization)” figure (see red reference “AC” in Table 8 above). This amount is highlighted in pink. The third amount shown is AGNC’s projected “reversal of unrealized (“gain”) loss on investment securities measured at FMV through net income, net” figure (see red reference “AD” in Table 8 above). This amount is highlighted in dark teal.
 Therefore, after AGNC’s projected net realized loss on the sale of agency securities of $50 million and net unrealized gain on investment securities measured at FMV through net income of ($25) million is reversed out, the company’s total net unrealized gain on AFS securities is projected to be $159 million for the second quarter of 2017 (see red reference “(AB + AC + AD) = AE” in Table 8 above). This amount is highlighted in grey. Brief Discussion of MTGE’s and NLY’s Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Agency Securities, Net Account: I see general similarities between AGNC and the company’s affiliate MTGE regarding agency MBS portfolio strategies. As such, I see a fairly similar projection between AGNC’s unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities, net account and MTGE’s “unrealized gain (loss) on agency securities, net” account for the second quarter of 2017 (proportionally speaking). With that being said, when compared to AGNC, MTGE had a slightly higher proportional share of 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS holdings as of 3/31/2017 which needs to be considered regarding projected valuations. Furthermore, one should consider that AGNC likely “deployed” at least some of the company’s newly raised capital from its May 2017 equity offering during the quarter. In addition, MTGE also had a much larger non-agency MBS portfolio (proportionately speaking). Due to this fact, MTGE also has an “unrealized gain (loss) on non-agency securities, net” account that needs to be incorporated into the company’s financials. MTGE's non-agency MBS portfolio has different valuation methods which are mainly based on specific indexes and simulated models which are classified as level 3 assets per Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820. This includes, but is not limited to, prime, CRT, Alt-A, option ARM, and subprime holdings. MTGE’s non-agency MBS portfolio had a conditional prepayment rate (“CPR”) of 14%, a conditional default rate (“CDR”) of 3%, and a voluntary prepayment rate (“VPR”) of 12% as of 3/31/2017. I anticipate a relatively flat-minor increase to these three metrics during the second quarter of 2017 which would slightly impact valuations. Further discussion of MTGE’s non-agency MBS portfolio is beyond the scope of this article.
 When it comes to AGNC’s sector peer NLY, I see one modest difference that would impact the account described above. As of 3/31/2017, only 9% of NLY’s fixed-rate agency MBS portfolio consisted of 15-year maturities whereas AGNC had 26% of the company’s MBS portfolio in 15-year maturities (excluding TBA MBS positions). Since most 30-year fixed-rate agency MBS coupons had additional price increases when compared to 15-year fixed-rate agency MBS with similar coupons, NLY should have a slightly higher combined total net valuation gain on AFS securities (realized and unrealized) when compared to AGNC during the second quarter of 2017 (proportionally speaking). In addition, it should also be noted management has recently broadened NLY’s investment portfolio by allocating more capital into commercial debt/real estate, preferred equity, corporate debt, and most recently middle market (“MM”) lending. Furthermore, NLY recently acquired a variable-rate agency mREIT, Hatteras Financial Corp. (HTS). Generally speaking, most of these asset classes, when compared to fixed-rate agency MBS, also experienced relatively flat-minor price increases during the second quarter of 2017. A further discussion of NLY’s MBS/investment portfolio is beyond the scope of this article. B) Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI/(OCL)): - Estimate of $159 Million; Range ($41)–359 Million  - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High  - See Red Reference “B” in Table 9 Below Next to the June 30, 2017, Column  Let us now take a look at AGNC's projected OCI/(OCL) and comprehensive income (loss) amounts. This information is provided in Table 9 below. Table 9 – AGNC Quarterly OCI/(OCL) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) Projection 


 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using data obtained from AGNC's quarterly investor presentation slides) After combining the company’s net unrealized gain on AFS securities of $159 million and its net unrealized gain on interest rate swaps (upon reclassification) of $0, I am projecting AGNC will report OCI of $159 million for the second quarter of 2017 (see red reference “B” in Table 9 above). C) Comprehensive Income (Loss): - Estimate of $139 Million; Range ($61)–339 Million  - Comprehensive Income Available to Common Shareholders of $0.38 Per Share; Range ($0.20)–0.96 Per Share - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High  - See Red Reference “C” in Table 9 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column  Finally, let us look at AGNC’s comprehensive income for the second quarter of 2017. This is the summation of the following amounts: A) net loss of ($20) million (see PART 1 and PART 2); and B) OCI of $159 million (see analysis above). Therefore, when these two amounts are combined, I am projecting AGNC will report comprehensive income of $139 million for the second quarter of 2017. Conclusions Drawn From PART 1, PART 2, and PART 3:  To sum up the analysis from all three parts of the article, I am projecting AGNC will report the following amounts for the second quarter of 2017: A) Quarterly Net Loss of ($20) Million; Earnings Available to Common Shareholders of ($0.08) Per Share B) Quarterly OCI of $159 Million C) Quarterly Comprehensive Income (A and B Combined) of $139 Million; Comprehensive Income Available to Common Shareholders of $0.38 Per Share  AGNC’s projected net loss of ($20) million for the second quarter of 2017 is a minor decrease when compared to net income of $76 million for the first quarter of 2017. This is mainly due to AGNC’s projected net valuation loss of ($184) million regarding the company’s derivatives portfolio for the second quarter of 2017. For the same account in the prior quarter, AGNC recognized a net valuation loss of only ($40) million.
 I am also projecting AGNC will report OCI of $139 million for the second quarter of 2017. This projected amount is a very minor increase when compared to OCI of $122 million for the first quarter of 2017. I believe AGNC will slightly underperform the fixed-rate agency mREIT peer average in regards to valuation fluctuations for the second quarter of 2017. This is mainly due to AGNC’s higher hedging coverage ratio and the composition of the company’s MBS portfolio heading into the second quarter of 2017 when compared to its fixed-rate agency mREIT peers. I believe four key factors to analyze within the fixed-rate agency mREIT sector this quarter are the following: 1) each company’s proportion of 15-year MBS holdings versus 30-year MBS holdings; 2) each company’s hedging coverage ratio; 3) each company’s proportion of long-term derivative instruments versus short-term derivative instruments; and 4) each company’s proportion of specified pools (for instance HARP and LLB securities). Dependent upon these factors, I believe results will modestly vary across the fixed-rate agency mREIT sector for the second quarter of 2017. My BUY, SELL, or HOLD Recommendation: For my AGNC BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation, please see PART 1 of this article (link provided at the beginning of the article).  Final Note: The projected amounts from this three-part article will have a direct impact on AGNC’s projected book value (“BV”) as of 6/30/2017. My upcoming AGNC BV projection article will be available to readers prior to the company’s earnings press release for the second quarter of 2017 on 7/26/2017. Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each reader’s current investing strategy. The factual information provided within this article is intended to help assist readers when it comes to investing strategies/decisions.   During January-March 2014, I initiated (and subsequently add to) a position in MTGE at a weighted average purchase price of $18.47 per share. On 3/4/2016 and 4/8/2016, I directly increased my position in MTGE at a weighted average purchase price of $14.36 and $14.47 per share, respectively. These two combined purchases had the same approximate monetary value of my combined 2014 purchases. My entire MTGE position had a weighted average purchase price of $16.443 per share. On 6/15/2017, I sold my entire MTGE position at a weighted average price of $19.09 per share as my price target of $19.10 was met that day. My MTGE total return (when including change in stock price and dividends received/gains on reinvested dividends), was 45.4%. My 2016 purchases were disclosed, at the time, to readers in subsequent AGNC articles over the following several months. My 2017 sale was disclosed to readers in “real time” (that day) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.
 On 11/27/2015, I initiated a position in AGNCB; Series B preferred stock. On 12/7/2015, 12/9/2015, 12/14/2015, 1/14/2016, and 1/20/2016 I selectively increased my position in AGNCB. When combined, my AGNCB position has a weighted average purchase price of $23.215 per share. This weighted average per share price excludes all dividends received/reinvested. I currently hold (personally and through affiliated entities) 0.71% of the outstanding shares of AGNCB. Each AGNCB trade was disclosed to readers in real time (that day) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.     All trades/investments I have performed over the past few years have been disclosed to readers in real time (that day at the latest) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha. Through this resource, readers can look up all my prior disclosures (buys/sells) regarding all companies I cover here at Seeking Alpha (see my profile page for a list of all stocks covered).
Disclosure: I am/we are long CHMI.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

How we can help
We get it. Investing can be complicated. Ask all the questions you want, and we will answer them in plain English. Your financial advisor is your long-term financial partner. These are important goals and you need an advocate – someone who listens and really understands what's important to you. We believe that's the best way to develop a personalized financial strategy.

Understands Me
I want to work with a financial advisor who really gets to know me and my family, our goals and what’s important to us.

I’m looking for a financial advisor who will spend time educating me on investment topics and answering my questions.







Knows My Investment Style
I want someone who makes recommendations in my best interest and explains how they can help me make progress towards my goals.







Meets on My Schedule
Meeting with my financial advisor should be convenient. And I want choices – whether that means meeting in person or over the phone.







Stays in Touch
I want my financial advisor to contact me to reassure me that I’m on the right track or make suggestions if I’m not. Even if I’m not expecting it.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
