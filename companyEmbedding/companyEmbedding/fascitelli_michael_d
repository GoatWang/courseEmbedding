Jane Lyons, co-president of CREW New York and a managing partner at Rhodes Associates.
Michael Fascitelli doesn’t want to hire his three sons. Though the venerable New York real estate executive, currently the CEO of Imperial Companies and previously the founder of MDF Capital and the president and CEO of Vornado Realty Trust, could easily employ his influence to secure any one of his young adult sons a coveted position at his company, he said he’d rather they finish college, work hard and pursue their own interests.
It’s this sense of dedication and the value placed on hard work that has earned Fascitelli his seat among the real estate elite.
At the Commercial Real Estate Women Network of New York’s November 3 luncheon, Fascitelli participated in a discussion with Crain’s New York Business senior real estate reporter Dan Geiger, talking about everything from family values and Frank Sinatra to Fascitelli’s extracurricular activities as a Port Authority board member and part owner of the Milwaukee Bucks.
With more than 30 years and counting in the New York real estate industry, Fascitelli has seen the transformation of the city and its neighborhoods firsthand. Recalling the formerly rough state of neighborhoods like Hell’s Kitchen, which is now home to pricey apartments, retail and entertainment, he said, “There isn’t a bad neighborhood in New York.” When it comes to questions of oversupply and density in the Big Apple, he noted, “I don’t think New York is in bad shape. There’s just always excess in these kinds of markets.”
For those looking to avoid this excess, Fascitelli said he sees potential in areas like the South Bronx and the New Jersey waterfront, areas that are less developed than their other outer-borough counterparts, but are still within a feasible commuting distance from Manhattan. As commuters seem to make up more of the fabric of New York’s workforce, Fascitelli, in his role on the board of the Port Authority, is looking forward to accommodate this growing trend. He said that his motivation for joining the board was to give back to the city in a way that will, “benefit generations to come.” And to those looking for an update on a new and improved Port Authority bus terminal? “If I knew the timing,” he said, “I wouldn’t tell you anyway.”

ULI Foundation Governor Michael D. ­Fascitelli
The ULI Foundation will honor ULI Foundation Governor Michael D. ­Fascitelli at an October 20 dinner gala preceding the 2014 ULI Fall Meeting. The event will be held at the American Museum of Natural History on Central Park West, with net proceeds benefiting ULI programs supported by the ULI Foundation.
Fall Meeting Gala | Register for the Fall Meeting in NYC
A well-known figure in New York real estate finance, Fascitelli was president of Vornado Realty Trust, one of the largest U.S. REITs for office and retail properties, from 1996 to 2009 and chief executive officer from 2009 to 2013. Before Vornado, Fascitelli led the real estate investment practice at Goldman Sachs, where he was made a partner in 1992. He is a graduate of the University of Rhode Island and earned his MBA from ­Harvard Business School.
Fascitelli’s contributions to ULI date to the early 1990s when he joined the Commercial & Retail Development Product Council. He has served on several other product councils, offering insights to fellow ULI members about capital markets. He has also been instrumental in shaping ULI’s governance and strategy through his service on major boards and committees, including the ULI Board of Directors. He was a ULI trustee from 1994 to 2014.
“[Mike’s] presence and wisdom have contributed greatly to the mission of the ULI Foundation and ULI through developing the next generation of real estate professionals and instilling in them a sense of responsibility for sustainability and the built environment,” said ULI New York Chairman Robert C. Lieber, executive managing director at C-III Capital Partners. “I am thrilled to be honoring Mike at the 2014 Fall Meeting in New York, as his career exemplifies excellence and innovation and the man himself exudes warmth, collegiality, and professionalism.”
Fascitelli and his wife, Elizabeth Cogan Fascitelli, recently committed to a $2 million planned gift to the ULI Foundation. In addition to their philanthropic work with ULI, the couple serves on the board of the Child Mind Institute, a New York City–based nonprofit dedicated to finding more effective treatments for childhood psychiatric and learning disorders and supporting research on brain development.
Tickets to the ULI Foundation’s Fall Meeting Gala are available for purchase at fall.uli.org/session/fall-meeting-gala/.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
