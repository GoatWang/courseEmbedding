Guggenheim High Yield Fund
SIHAX | SIHSX | SHYIX | SIHPX | SHYSX












Guggenheim High Yield Fund (the "Fund") seeks high current income with capital appreciation as a secondary objective. The Fund pursues its objective by investing at least 80% of its assets, under normal market conditions, in a broad range of high yield debt securities.

Seeking to outperform the broad high yield market, the fund has the flexibility to invest across a broad array of high yield securities including corporate bonds, syndicated bank loans, mortgage-backed, asset-backed securities, and convertible securities.
Investments are made through rigorous credit selection based on proprietary research that incorporates knowledge of companies, industries and capital structures to develop a unique perspective on the worthiness of each investment.
An allocation to high yield securities, when added to a mixed asset portfolio, may provide additional diversification¹ along with higher income and return potential. Investors should note, high yield, below investment grade and unrated high risk debt securities may present additional risk because these securities may be less liquid and present more credit risk than investment grade bonds.

The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products with at least a three-year history and does not include the effect of sales charges. Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Neither Morningstar, nor its content providers, are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of its information.

The Funds may not be suitable for all investors. Investments in fixed-income securities are subject to the possibility that interest rates could rise, causing the value of the Funds’ securities and share price to decline. Fixed-income securities with longer durations are subject to more volatility than those with shorter durations. High yield, below investment grade, and unrated debt securities are subject to greater volatility and risk of default than investment grade bonds and may be less liquid. Investors in asset-backed securities, including residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other structured finance investments, generally receive payments that are part interest and part return of principal, which may vary based on the rate the loans are repaid. Some asset-backed securities, including mortgage-backed securities, may have structures that make their reaction to interest rates and other factors difficult to predict, causing their prices to be volatile; and they are subject to interest rate, credit, liquidity, and valuation risks. Loan investments are often below investment grade or unrated and subject to special types of risks, including credit, interest rate, counterparty, liquidity, and prepayment risk. The Funds’ use of leverage, through borrowings or instruments such as derivatives, may cause the Funds to be more volatile and riskier than if they had not been leveraged. Please see the Funds’ prospectuses for more information on these and other risks.

‡SEC 30-day yield is based on net investment income for the most recent 30-day period, is annualized and is divided by the offering price at month-end.

This fund may not be suitable for all investors. • The Fund’s market value will change in response to interest rate changes and market conditions among other factors. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. • The Fund’s exposure to high yield securities may subject the Fund to greater volatility. • The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, which may be more volatile and less liquid, increasing the risk of loss when compared to traditional securities. Certain of the derivative instruments are also subject to the risks of counterparty default and adverse tax treatment. •The Fund’s use of leverage, through borrowings or instruments such as derivatives, may cause the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged. • Instruments and strategies (such as borrowing transactions and reverse repurchase agreements) may provide leveraged exposure to a particular investment, which will magnify any gains or losses on those investments. • The Fund may invest in foreign securities which carry additional risks when compared to U.S. securities, due to the impact of diplomatic, political or economic developments in the country in question (investments in emerging markets securities are generally subject to an even greater level of risks). • Investments in syndicated bank loans generally offer a floating interest rate and involve special types of risks. • The Fund’s investments in other investment vehicles subject the Fund to those risks and expenses affecting the investment vehicle. • The Fund’s investments in restricted securities may involve financial and liquidity risk. • You may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. • It is important to note that the Fund is not guaranteed by the U.S. government. • Please read the prospectus for more detailed information regarding these and other risks.

+The advisor has contractually agreed to waive fees and expenses through February 1, 2018, to limit the ordinary operating expenses of the fund. The fund may have net expenses greater than the expense cap as a result of any acquired fund fees and expenses or other expenses that are excluded from the calculation. Total annual operating expenses vary by share class. See the prospectus for information on the fees and expenses that apply to each share class.

Investment Objective
The Guggenheim BulletShares 2014 High Yield Corporate Bond ETF* (NYSE Arca: BSJE), seeks investment results that correspond generally to the performance, before the Fund’s fees and expenses, of a high yield corporate bond index called the BulletShares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond 2014 Index. The Index is designed to represent the performance of a held-to-maturity portfolio of U.S. dollar-denominated high yield corporate bonds with effective maturities in 2014. The effective maturity of an eligible corporate bond is determined by its actual maturity or, in the case of callable securities, the effective maturity of the security as determined in accordance with a rules-based methodology developed by Accretive Asset Management LLC, the index provider. The Fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in component securities that comprise the Index. Under normal conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in high yield securities (“junk bonds”), which are debt securities that are rated below investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, or are unrated securities the investment adviser believes are of comparable quality.
†The Fund has a designated year of maturity of 2014 and will terminate on or about December 31, 2014. In connection with such termination, the Fund will make a cash distribution to then-current shareholders of its net assets after making appropriate provisions for any liabilities of the Fund. The Fund does not seek to return any predetermined amount at maturity. In the final twelve months of operation, as the bonds held by the Fund mature, the Fund’s portfolio will transition to cash and cash equivalents, including without limitation U.S.Treasury Bills and investment grade commercial paper, which may result in a lower yield than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Fund and/or prevailing yields for bonds in the market. The Fund will terminate on or about the date above without requiring additional approval by the Trust’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) or Fund shareholders. The Board may change the termination date to an earlier or later date if a majority of the Board determines the change to be in the best interest of the Fund.

Index Methodology


BulletShares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond Index, BulletShares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond 2014 Index, and BulletShares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond 2015 Index (the “High Yield Indices”).  
Each Index is designed to represent the performance of a held-to-maturity portfolio of U.S. dollar-denominated high yield corporate bonds with effective maturities in the same calendar year. The effective maturity of an eligible corporate bond is determined by its actual maturity or, in the case of callable securities, the effective maturity of the security as determined in accordance with a rules-based methodology developed by Accretive.






Index Construction



Securities eligible for inclusion in each Index are U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-income securities of corporate issuers that meet the following criteria:
	
have at least $200 million of outstanding face value;
have a maximum rating of BB+ from Fitch Investor Services (“Fitch”) or Standard & Poor’s Rating Group (“S&P”) or Ba1 from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and a minimum average credit rating of CCC- from Fitch or S&P or Caa3 from Moody’s and
are issued by companies domiciled in the U.S., Canada, Western Europe (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden Switzerland and the United Kingdom) or Japan.
Each Index is limited to securities that pay fixed amounts of interest and the following types of securities are specifically excluded:
		
retail bonds;
floating-rate securities;
zero-coupon bonds and zero-coupon step-up bonds;
bonds that permit issuers to make coupon payments either in cash or in new debt securities (i.e., PIK-Toggle bonds);
convertible securities and other bonds with equity-type features; and
inflation- and other index-linked bonds.
Each Index is constructed as follows:
			
At the beginning of each calendar year, each Index undergoes an effective maturity reconstitution, where bonds in the universe of eligible securities are assigned to an Index based on their actual maturities or, in the case of callable bonds, effective maturities as determined by a proprietary rules based process.
Prior to July 1 of each Index’s target maturity year, the Index is rebalanced based on the market values of the Index’s constituents on a monthly basis. Additions to or removals from the universe of eligible securities are reflected in each monthly rebalancing.
Prior to July 1 of each Index’s target maturity year, coupon payments and proceeds of constituents that are called or mature between rebalances are reinvested in 13- week U.S. Treasury Bills until the next monthly rebalancing of the Index.
Beginning on July 1 of an Index’s target maturity year:
				
The Index is calculated using a proprietary methodology that seeks to track the return of a held-to-maturity individual bond. In accordance with this methodology, the portfolio of bonds established in connection with the last monthly rebalancing of an Index prior to July 1 of its target maturity year will be fixed for the remainder of the life of the Index.
As bonds in an Index mature or are called and principal is returned, coupon payments and proceeds are re-invested in 13-week U.S. Treasury Bills until the termination of the Index. It is expected that each Index will consist largely, if not completely, of assets invested in such instruments when it terminates.
Decisions regarding additions to and removals from an Index are made by the Index Provider and are subject to periodic review by a policy steering committee known as the BulletShares® Index Committee.















 Risks and Other Considerations


Performance displayed represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Total returns reflect the reinvestment of all dividends. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For up-to-date fund performance, including performance current to the most recent month-end, please visit the ETF performance page.  ETFs are subject to third party transaction fees/commissions. Net asset value (NAV) is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets, then dividing by the number of shares outstanding. Market close is the last price at which shares are traded. Fund shares may trade at, above or below NAV. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
Performance results for periods under one year are short - term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles.
Fund data is subject to change on a daily basis.
Composition is subject to change. Information provided is for illustration purposes only and may not reflect current investments by the fund.

Guggenheim Investments ETFs may not be suitable for all investors. • Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Most investors will also incur customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of an ETF. • Investments in securities and derivatives, in general, are subject to market risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate over time. • ETF Shares may trade below their net asset value ("NAV"). The NAV of shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of an ETF's holdings. In addition, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares will develop or be maintained. • Please review a prospectus carefully for more information of the risks associated with each ETF.

Investment Objective
Guggenheim BulletShares 2019 High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: BSJJ) seeks investment results that correspond generally to the performance, before the Fund’s fees and expenses, of a high yield corporate bond index called the BulletShares® USD high Yield Corporate Bond 2019 Index.


Index Description
The NASDAQ Bulletshares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond 2019 Index is designed to represent the performance of a held-to-maturity portfolio of U.S. dollar-denominated high yield corporate bonds with effective maturities in the year 2019.


Fund Highlights

Bond-Like Experience in an ETF: Combines the benefits of bonds—monthly income, final distribution at maturity, as well as control of portfolio maturity, yield, and credit quality—with the advantages of ETFs—broad diversification, liquidity, transparency, convenience, and cost-effectiveness.
Precise Exposure: Provides targeted high yield exposure, enabling investors to build customized portfolios tailored to specific maturity profiles, risk preferences, and investments goals.
Ease of Use: Provides a cost-effective and convenient way to build bond ladders and manage interest rate risk, via fixed-income ETFs with consecutively maturing years ranging from 2017 to 2024.

†The Fund has a designated year of maturity of 2019 and will terminate on or about December 31, 2019. In connection with such termination, the Fund will make a cash distribution to then-current shareholders of its net assets after making appropriate provisions for any liabilities of the Fund. The Fund does not seek to return any predetermined amount at maturity. In the final six months of operation, as the bonds held by the Fund mature, the Fund's portfolio will transition to cash and cash equivalents, including without limitation U.S.Treasury Bills and investment grade commercial paper, which may result in a lower yield than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Fund and/or prevailing yields for bonds in the market. The Fund will terminate on or about the date above without requiring additional approval by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the "Board") or Fund shareholders. The Board may change the termination date to an earlier or later date if a majority of the Board determines the change to be in the best interest of the Fund.

Index Methodology


NASDAQ BulletShares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond 2019 Index
BulletShares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond Indices measure the performance of maturity-targeted segments of the U.S. dollar-denominated high yield corporate bond market. Set forth below are the criteria for determining the index family’s universe of eligible securities (the “Eligible Universe”) and the methodology for constructing each index. BulletShares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond Indices are owned by Guggenheim Index ServicesSM, an affiliate of Guggenheim Partners, and maintained by NASDAQ (the “Index Calculation Agent”). The BulletShares® methodology allocates bonds from the Eligible Universe into the BulletShares® Indices based on maturity, or in some cases effective maturity date.






Index Construction



BulletShares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond Indices Eligibility Criteria
Issuers. Only U.S. dollar-denominated bonds issued by companies domiciled in the U.S., Canada, Western Europe¹ or Japan are included in the Eligible Universe.
Types of Bonds. Bonds must pay fixed amounts of taxable interest to be included in the Eligible Universe. The following bond types are specifically included:
	
Fixed coupon bonds.
Callable bonds.
Step-ups, event-driven, rating-driven and registration-driven bonds.
Amortizing bonds and sinking funds with fixed sinking schedules.
Rule 144A bonds.

Selection Criteria. Bonds must meet all of the following selection criteria to be included in the Eligible Universe:

	
Maximum credit rating of BB+ from Fitch Investor Services (“Fitch”) or Standard and Poor’s Rating Group (“S&P) or Ba1 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s) and a minimum average rating of CCC- from Fitch, S&P and Moody’s. The minimum average credit rating is computed by calculating the simple average of a bond’s ratings published by Fitch, S&P and Moody’s and then rounding down to the nearest rating step.
Outstanding face value of at least $200 million (existing bonds in the eligible universe require $150 million face value to remain).

Exclusions. To ensure adequate investability, the following bond types are specifically excluded:

	
Bonds with an initial term of less than one year.
Reg S bonds, Eurodollar² bonds and EuroMTN bonds.
Retail bonds.
Floating rate bonds.
Zero coupon bonds.
Convertible bonds.
Bonds cum or ex-warrant.
Bonds with one cash flow only.
New bonds that have already been called.
Bonds that permit issuers to make coupon payments either in cash or in new debt securities (i.e., PIK-toggle bonds).
Inflation or other index-linked bonds.
Bonds guaranteed by an agency, national or supranational government (including FDIC or TLGP).
Perpetual securities (including Trust Preferred).
Securities for which the Index Calculation Agent is unable to, or is prohibited from providing an evaluated price.
Distressed bonds, defined as bonds whose yield to worst ranks among the top 1% by market value among bonds passing all other eligibility criteria and whose dirty price is below $80. Bonds defined as distressed will be excluded for the next three monthly rebalances (including the current rebalance) regardless of yield and price changes.


Index Creation
	On a semi-annual basis (last business day of June and December), existing bonds in the Eligible Universe are distributed into BulletShares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond Indices in accordance with their effective maturities. If no embedded issuer call option exists, then effective maturity is the actual year of maturity. If a bond contains an embedded issuer call option, with the first call date within 13 months of maturity and a par call price, then effective maturity shall be its actual year of maturity unless the yield to next call date is less than the yield to maturity, in which case its effective maturity shall be the year of the next call date.
Target Weights
	BulletShares® USD High Yield Corporate Bond Indices employ a market value weighting methodology to weight individual positions, subject to a 5% limit on individual issuers in each index applied at each monthly rebalancing prior to the final maturing year of an index. Once set, target weights are free to float due to market actions. Weights are reviewed and the index rebalanced monthly.

¹Western Europe here includes: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.
²Denoted by ISIN codes beginning with country codes other than “U.S.”






 Risks and Other Considerations


Performance displayed represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than original cost. Total returns reflect the reinvestment of all dividends. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For up-to-date fund performance, including performance current to the most recent month-end, please visit the ETF performance page.  ETFs are subject to third party transaction fees/commissions. Net asset value (NAV) is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets, then dividing by the number of shares outstanding. Market close is the last price at which shares are traded. Fund shares may trade at, above or below NAV. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
Performance results for periods under one year are short - term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles.
Risk Considerations Investors should consider the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund, which may cause you to lose money, including the entire principal amount that you invest. Interest Rate Risk: As interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities held by the fund are likely to decrease. Securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations. Credit/Default Risk: Issuers or guarantors of debt instruments or the counterparty to a repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio securities may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments or otherwise honor its obligations. Debt instruments are subject to varying degrees of credit risk, which may be reflected in credit ratings. Securities issued by the U.S. government generally have less credit risk than debt securities of non-government issuers. However, securities issued by certain U.S. government agencies are not necessarily backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Credit rating downgrades and defaults (failure to make interest or principal payment) may potentially reduce the fund’s income and share price. High-Yield Securities Risk: High yield securities generally offer a higher current yield than that available from higher grade issues, but typically involve greater risk. Securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “junk bonds.” The ability of issuers of high yield securities to make timely payments of interest and principal may be adversely impacted by adverse changes in general economic conditions, changes in the financial condition of the issuers and price fluctuations in response to changes in interest rates. Asset Class Risk: The bonds in the fund’s portfolio may underperform the returns of other bonds or indexes that track other industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Call Risk/PRepayment Risk: During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in the fund’s having to reinvest proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Extension Risk: An issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation later than expected. This may happen when there is a rise in interest rates. Under these circumstances, the value of the obligation will decrease and the fund’s performance may suffer from its inability to invest in higher yielding securities. Income Risk: Falling interest rates may cause the fund’s income to decline. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. If the fund invests in illiquid securities or securities that become illiquid, fund returns may be reduced because the fund may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price. Declining Yield Risk: During the final year of the fund’s operations, as the bonds held by the fund mature and the fund’s portfolio transitions to cash and cash equivalents, the fund’s yield will generally tend to move toward the yield of cash and cash equivalents and thus may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the fund and/or prevailing yields for bonds in the market. Fluctuation of Yield and Liquidation Amount Risk: The fund, unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, will make distributions of income that vary over time. Unlike a direct investment in bonds, the breakdown of returns between fund distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of your investment. For example, at times during the fund’s existence, it may make distributions at a greater (or lesser) rate than the coupon payments received on the fund’s portfolio, which will result in the fund returning a lesser (or greater) amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the case. The rate of fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax characterization of your returns from an investment in the fund relative to a direct investment in corporate bonds. If the amount you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the fund’s termination is higher or lower than your cost basis, you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes. Concentration Risk: If the index concentrates in an industry or group of industries, the fund’s investments will be concentrated accordingly. In such event, the value of the fund’s shares may rise and fall more than the value of shares of a fund that invests in securities of companies in a broader range of industries. Consumer Staples Sector Risk: Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production spending. In addition, companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The fund may be adversely affected by events or developments negatively impacting the consumer staples sector or issuers within the consumer staples sector. Telecommunications Sector Risk: the telecommunications sector may be affected by extensive government regulation, industry competition and obsolescence of telecommunications products and services due to technological advancement. The fund may be adversely affected by events or developments negatively impacting the telecommunications sector or issuers within the telecommunications sector. In addition, the funds are subject to: Non-correlation risk, Replication Management Risk, Issuer-Specific Changes and Non-Diversified Fund Risk. Please read the prospectus for more detailed Information regarding these and other risks.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 590 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

BS, St. John's University, 2002





















Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks high current income; capital appreciation is a secondary objective.




Strategy



The fund invests at least 80% of its assets (net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes), under normal circumstances, in a broad range of high yield, high risk debt securities rated below the top four long-term rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or, if unrated, determined by Security Investors, LLC, also known as Guggenheim Investments (the "Investment Manager"), to be of comparable quality (also known as "junk bonds").


Risk



The fund may invest in lower-quality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 05/01/2015.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 08/05/1996, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The fund may invest in lower-quality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 5/1/2015.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 8/5/1996, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 5/1/2015.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 8/5/1996, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
10. Fixed Income StyleMap® StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
