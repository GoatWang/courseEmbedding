				User Testimonials			







“I can say that we have strongly recommended Scar Heal products for our plastic surgery patients for the past 5 years. With optimal surgical techniques along with the Scar Heal products we are able to obtain the best results possible. From small children to adults they are user friendly and are an affordable, reliable and safe treatment.”* 



Dr. David E. Halpern M.D.FACS, Tampa, FL.


“I wanted to let you know the scar ointment has already begun to work. I have already seen a difference after 3 days. I’ve tried everything over the past year; fading creams, azelex, creams that eliminate razor burns, antibiotics, you name it. If you were not aware, the cream is effective on sun damaged skin which has developed the dark, crusty patches. This was the problem I was trying to eliminate by attempting to buff off with a foot file, cuticle clipper. etc. Scar Esthetique® Scar Creme with Silicone is minimizing these patches making them flat and fading them at the same time. I can’t thank you enough.”* 



T. N. Davis MT (ASCP)


“I am an esthetician and have sold Scar Fx® Scar Therapy to many of my clients. They all have had excellent results. We certainly recommend it to patients of all skin types with all different conditions."* 



R. Sharpe Esthetician

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

When you're well.

                            Don't wait

 little one or a family health assessment in the comfort of your home.                          

                            Learn more

In the press








House calls for the Uber age.
These doctors do house calls – for just $99
Bringing back old-school techniques with new-school technology
Heal will bring a well qualified doctor right to your own house — no months-long waiting for an appointment or germy waiting rooms needed.
The Heal app sent an excellent Stanford-trained doctor to my door in under an hour.
As straight-forward as ordering a ride from Uber or Lyft
The convenience of seeing a doctor when you want to is priceless.
Doctors can do it all in the privacy of your home.
Heal is your family doctor in your family room.
If I had called my regular doctor, I would have had to fit into their schedule — probably the next day — fight traffic, find parking and wait an hour in the waiting room.
The old-school house call appears to be making a comeback with a little high-tech help.

 Simple Pricing.





Two Ways to Pay
Transparent Costs


                          Aetna, United Healthcare, Cigna, Blue Shield, and Anthem Blue Cross PPO members typically pay no more for a Heal house call than their regular doctor visit co-pay. Everyone else pays Heal's $99 flat fee.                        

                          A Heal house call costs just $99. No membership fees. No hidden charges. Soon to be in-network with select major insurance plans.

HealFast Skincare Products


HealFast SkincareTM is based on a proprietary process called Ovasome TechnologyTM. Basically it’s the process of incorporating eggs into topical skin care products. As simple as it sounds Ovasome TechnologyTM  took years to fully develop. You’re probably thinking, why can’t I just crack an egg and rub it on my skin? The main reason is because the eggs molecular structure is too large to penetrate the skin and you would receive little benefit from this application.
With Ovasome TechnologyTM we can effectively incorporate the egg into topical creams, lotions and serums so all the nutritional content remains active. By using this technique your skin benefits from over 70 natural vitamins, minerals and proteins. Ovasome TechnologyTM is a unique scientific breakthrough and is exclusive to HealFast SkincareTM .

HealFast Repair Cream


4.97 out of 5



HealFast Repair Cream is excelent for all types of skin maladies & irritations. This gentle cream can be used on people of all ages from children to adults.
 
The concept behind HealFast comes from the study of how the skin repairs itself. When a skin irritation occurs, the body naturally tries to rush nutrients to the problem areas so that it can heal or repair itself. The reason it takes several days to even weeks for some things to heal is because the body has only limited amounts of nutrients that can be sourced to the problem.
 
HealFast is formulated using Ovasome Technology to source nutrients from herbal and food based ingredients. This technology provides the skin with all of the vitamins, minerals and proteins that are necessary for life. This creates a nutrient rich environment on the body that promotes healthy normal skin.
 
Our customers have used HealFast Repair cream for the following: dry skin, cuts, burns, to prevent scarring after plastic surgery, chapped skin/lips, sunburn, diaper rash, eczema, cradle cap, abrasions, insect bites, bed sores and more.
 
HealFast Repair Cream is also the perfect daily moisturizer for face, neck, hands, feet and everywhere in between.   The cream has exceptional penetration to provide immediate relief and visible improvement for distressed skin. With our fragrance free formulation your skin will feel soft and moist and not greasy and smelly. This cream is excellent for preventing stretch marks during pregnancy.  Doctor Recommended.
 
** This cream is our original L’Avenir HealFast Repair Cream just with new packaging.

For 15 years our #1 Product - HealFast Repair Cream


Truly a “miracle cream”, HealFast Repair is excellent for all types of skin maladies & irritations. This gentle cream can be used on people of all ages from babies to adults. The concept behind HealFast Repair comes from the study of how the skin repairs itself. When a skin irritation occurs, the body naturally tries to rush nutrients to the problem area so that it can heal or repair itself. The reason it takes several days or even weeks for some things to heal is because the body has only a limited amount of nutrients that can be sourced to the problem. By applying HealFast Repair, an environment rich in all the nutrients needed by your skin is created naturally.
