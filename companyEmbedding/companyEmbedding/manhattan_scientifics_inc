Our company

The Company's business model capitalizes on inventions and technology   from which profits are created through licensing. MSI is dedicated to   earning profit for its 8,600 shareholders by identifying, supporting,   patenting and marketing technical innovation by harvesting top   technology talent to bring game-changing product to the market.
We emphasize novel technology in the Nanomedicine space with the   potential to be disruptive and the ability to establish sustainable   businesses.
We are "patient capital" with experienced business building partners   who bring the perspective of merchant bankers, not venture capitalists.   Our approach to assist scientists to commercialize their work is by   providing a forum within which the commercialization process is fostered   through partnerships with existing companies (Fortune/1000 or larger).   The entrepreneurial scientists and engineers who join us create personal   success and wealth on an accelerated basis by virtue of ownership of   publicly traded Manhattan Scientifics shares (OTC BB: MHTX).

Advanced Materials
Manhattan Scientifics has acquired the exclusive rights to the key patents and IP and will soon be positioned to enter into manufacturing and licensing agreements.

The story of Manhattan Scientifics begins with the holographic   research component of the Company. In the late 1980s the   Microelectronics &  Computer Corporation (MCC), invested   approximately $25 million in holographic data storage research.
The research produced no conclusive results. However, Manhattan   Scientifics CEO, Marvin Maslow, fascinated by the potential of   holographic storage, was reluctant to give up, believing that   eventually, its time would come. He decided a more intense and focused   research effort, with new expertise, might eventually produce the   long-sought results.
Meanwhile, in August 1997 Maslow visited Los Alamos National   Laboratory (LANL) to investigate new technologies with commercialization   potential. LANL's Civilian Industrial Technology Program Office,   functioning in the capacity of matchmaker, introduced Maslow to Robert   Hockaday, a LANL physicist who had taken entrepreneurial   leave-of-absence to refine a patented MicroFuel Cell technology he had   been developing with his own funds. Maslow recognized that the   holographic project might benefit from the expertise of Los Alamos   National Laboratory materials science experts, and, combined with the   MicroFuel Cell technology, would be a solid foundation for a technology   incubator to commercialize leading-edge technologies.
Knowing that fledgling companies can flounder during the   standard capitalization process of protracted analysis and negotiations, and that getting a new technology to market quickly is crucial to   success, Maslow deployed what he calls a "guerrilla financing" strategy.   In a period of approximately four months he formed Manhattan   Scientifics, Inc., raised the capital Hockaday estimated he needed to   begin intensive development of a working prototype, and took the Company   public on January 9, 1998 by means of a reverse merger.

Alternative energy

Manhattan Scientifics introduced several potential solutions to the   world wide alternative energy need as it relates to personal, 2-wheel   transportation, particularly in Asia. One example is the companies   development of the award winning NovArs hydrogen powered fuel cell   engine. Light weight and portable, it may be ideal to provide a "green"   inexpensive system to drive scooters, bicycles, power tools, portable   electronics, wheel chairs, golf carts, and home emergency power. The   company won Time Magazine "Invention of the Year" award for its fuel   cell Aprilia concept bicycle engine in 2001. To date a world - wide   hydrogen infrastructure has not materialized.
Manhattan Scientifics provided seed funding to former Los Alamos   National Laboratory scientist Robert Hockaday, who has developed a flat   printed fuel cell designed to provide an "always on" energy source to   power micro-electronics such as cellular telephones and pagers.   Manhattan Scientifics owns the worldwide right to the patented   technology. To date, the micro fuel cell has not been commercialized.
Efficient, lightweight, portable power for larger applications such as laptop computers, power tools and mobility devices.
Environmentally safe, AlwaysOn portable power for small   electronics, such as pagers and cellular phones powered by methanol and  water.

About us
Since its inception Manhattan Scientifics, Inc. has been a technology  developer that nurtures financially promising technologies with   potential global commercial applications. Manhattan Scientifics has   enjoyed a "Special informal relationship" and a lengthy successful   history in tech-transfer from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)   and the Sandia National Laboratory (SNL).			

Manhattan Scientifics, Inc. (OTCQB: MHTX), is focused on commercialization of technologies in the nano- medicine space. The company works among the brilliant minds and groundbreaking ideas in the fertile ground of New Mexico – home to two national laboratories, and one of the nation’s highest concentrations of PhD scientists. These technologies are scientifically advanced, but are rarely ready for commercialization.
We have expertise in licensing from the national laboratories and in working with individual inventors. We build intellectual property portfolios and business cases supporting new technologies, and shepherd them to relationships with industrial partners who are well-prepared to launch product. The result is a win for everyone – the lab and inventor see the technology enter the market, the industrial partner gets a solid foundation for a new product, and we profit from building the licensing bridge to industry.
We are currently focused on two opportunities: a nanostructured metals technology, and a nanoparticle-based technology that provides highly sensitive cancer detection.  The nanostructured metals technology has been revenue producing for several years.  The cancer detection technology can detect cancer years earlier, and is still pre-revenue.

 	Our company   		The Company's business model capitalizes on inventions and technology from which profits are created through licensing. MSI is dedicated to earning profit for its 8,600 shareholders by identifying, supporting, patenting and marketing technical innovation by harvesting top technology talent to bring game-changing product to the market. We emphasize novel technology in the Nanomedicine space with the potential to be disruptive and the ability to establish sustainable businesses.  		We are "patient capital" with experienced business building partners who bring the perspective of merchant bankers, not venture capitalists. Our approach to assist scientists to commercialize their work is by providing a forum within which the commercialization process is fostered through partnerships with existing companies (Fortune/1000 or larger). The entrepreneurial scientists and engineers who join us create personal success and wealth on an accelerated basis by virtue of ownership of publicly traded Manhattan Scientifics shares (OTC BB: MHTX).   	Technology     ADVANCED MATERIALS  			Manhattan Scientifics has acquired the exclusive rights to the key patents and IP and will soon be positioned to enter into manufacturing and licensing agreements.  			Nano Titanium   				Manhattan Scientific's nanostructured metal technology is based on over 16 years of highly focused research and development. Nanostructured metals and alloys possess significantly enhanced mechanical properties that include, for example, increased strength without concurrent losses in ductility, and significantly increased resistance to fatigue fracture. Nanostructured commercially pure grades of titanium have proven to also possess excellent machinability as well as high toughness and strength. Manhattan Scientifics has developed unique processing methodology for producing nanostructures in a wide range of ductile metals and alloys and is now commercializing this new and revolutionary technology.  				Enhanced strength and fatigue resistance  				Nanostructured metals and alloys offer many advantages for a wide range of structural applications. Application areas include biomedical structures, sports structures, aerospace and chemical structures, among others.        NANOMEDICINE  			Manhattan Scientifics and Senior Scientific, LLC have announced that they have begun cooperative work to commercialize Senior Scientific's nano medicine cancer detection technology. Manhattan Scientifics acquired Senior Scientific, along with all its patents and IP in the emerging field of nano medicine; specifically Dr. Flynn's work in biomagnetic detection of cancer and other diseases through magnetic field sensors. These sensors make it possible to identify and image small clusters of cancer cells substantially increasing the sensitivity for finding cancer at an earlier stage than is currently available, and without the use of ionizing radiation or large magnetic fields. The biomagnetic sensor method is applicable to breast, ovarian, leukemia, prostate, melanoma, and other cancers. Dr. Flynn's research has been funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH). Management intends to identify one or more appropriate Fortune/500 industrial partners in the Big Pharma group to bring product to the market under royalty bearing licenses.   				To learn more about Senior Scientific and the technologies being developed, please visit www.seniorscientific.com.  				About Nanomedicine  				The term "Nanomedicine" is commonly used to describe the convergence of nanotechnology and pharmacology. It has been defined as "the science and technology of diagnosing, treating, and preventing disease and traumatic injury, or relieving pain, and of preserving and improving human health, using molecular tools and molecular knowledge of the human body" by the European Science Foundation. (European Science Foundation)  				Nanomedicine will soon be used for diagnosing and treating cancer, musculoskeletal and inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and infectious diseases. In general, nanotechnology has the incredible potential to improve patient outcomes. What does this mean? Patients will be living longer with a greater quality of life!  				In the fight against cancer, nanotechnology introduces unique approaches to diagnosis and treatment that could not even be imagined with conventional technology. New tools engineered at sizes much smaller than a human cell will enable researchers and clinicians to detect cancer earlier, treat it with much greater precision and fewer side effects, and possibly stop the disease long before it can do any damage.  				Understanding Nanotechnology  				Nanotechnology is the development and engineering of devices so small that they are measured on a molecular scale. This emerging field involves scientists from many different disciplines, including physicists, chemists, engineers, information technologists, and material scientists, as well as biologists. Nanotechnology is being applied to almost every field imaginable, including electronics, magnetics, optics, information technology, materials development and biomedicine.  				The Size of Things  				Nanoscale devices are one hundred to ten thousand times smaller than human cells. They are similar in size to large biological molecules ("biomolecules") such as enzymes and receptors. As an example, hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen in red blood cells, is approximately 5 nanometers in diameter. Nanoscale devices smaller than 50 nanometers can easily enter most cells, while those smaller than 20 nanometers can move out of blood vessels as they circulate through the body.  				Because of their small size, nanoscale devices can readily interact with biomolecules on both the surface and inside cells. By gaining access to so many areas of the body, they have the potential to detect disease and deliver treatment in ways unimagined before now.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Manhattan Scientifics Cancer Diagnostic IPO Update






Business Wire




Dec 19, 2016 4:55 PM EST













 




























































  Manhattan Scientifics Inc. (OTCQB:MHTX) anticipates positive changes resulting from its plan to list the company's cancer diagnostic unit, Senior Scientific, on the Australian Stock Exchange.  The changes include:   Retirement of the company's long-term debt of $2.5M leaving MHTX with virtually no long-term debt on its balance sheet.   Senior Scientific, renamed Imagion Biosystems, issued a $6.9M Promissory note to its parent, Manhattan Scientifics, which will convert into equity upon certain events.   All future funding obligations required to commercialize the cancer diagnostic activity are transferred to Imagion Biosystems.   The parent company, which presently owns 100% of Imagion Biosystems, is relieved of payroll and overhead costs of Imagion Bio.    Manhattan Scientifics has fulfilled its mission to acquire, fund, prototype and assist Senior Scientific to incubate its cancer nanotechnology technology with a stated goal to bring product to the market. Currently, Manhattan Scientifics owns 100% of Imagion Biosystems.  Manny Tsoupanarias, Manhattan Scientifics CEO said, "Manhattan Scientifics will now focus on its nano-structured metals business, which has generated approximately $14M cash since 2010. Completion of this spin-off is a very significant milestone for both Manhattan Scientifics and Imagion Biosystems and we are excited about Imagion' s potential and extend our best wishes for success to Imagion' s management team and new board of directors."  Marvin Maslow, Manhattan Scientifics Chairman said, "We believe this to be a winning strategy for our shareholders. The elimination of significant overhead and the freedom to source new acquisition opportunities is exciting." Mr. Maslow continued, "Today our MHTX shareholders own the same value they owned before the Spin-out of Imagion Biosystems; they own shares in MHTX, which in turn owns all the shares Imagion Biosystems. Dilution will follow as Imagion Biosystems raises new capital. The achievement is that we recapitalized Senior Scientific/ Imagion Biosystems and it can move forward to complete its work and create value for all the MHTX shareholders."
