History[edit]




State Farm Insurance in Ontario.


State Farm was founded in 1922 by retired farmer George J. Mecherle as a mutual automobile insurance company owned by its policyholders. The firm specialized in auto insurance for farmers, and later expanded its services into other types of insurance, such as homeowners and life insurance, and to banking and financial services.
The State Farm jingle ("Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there") was written by American songwriter Barry Manilow in 1971. A cover was released by Weezer in 2011.[8][9] In the 1960s State Farm's first commercial jingle was originally created for The Jack Benny Program.[10]
As of December 2013 State Farm had 65,000 employees and 18,000 agents. February 2014 figures show the group servicing 80 million policies in the United States and Canada, of which over 44,000,000 are for automobiles, 27,000,000 are for fire, 7,000,000 for life, and more than 2 million bank accounts.
Michael Tipsord is Chairman and CEO of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,[2] and president and chief executive officer of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, State Farm Life Insurance Company, and other principal State Farm affiliates.[citation needed]
In 2014, the company sold its operations in Canada to Desjardins Group. Canadian policies were transferred to be underwritten by Desjardins Group on January 1, 2015. The State Farm brand continues to be used for agents and marketing.[7][11]
Logo[edit]




State Farm's tri-oval logo from 1953 to 2012.


The State Farm interlocked tri-oval logo was created in the mid-to-late 1940s and was updated in 1953. For nearly 60 years, this design was critical to its brand image.
On December 23, 2011, State Farm decided to transform its interlocked tri-oval logo to a contemporary logo to showcase the company’s core service offerings of auto, fire, and life. The new logo was introduced January 1, 2012, marking the company’s 90th anniversary. It consists of a simple three-oval design adjacent to the State Farm wordmark. According to Pam El, Marketing Vice President at State Farm, a change in image was needed to employ a bolder presence that could compete in today’s digital world.[12]

Advertisement[edit]
This commercial structure is from State Farm's "Get to a Better State" campaign that premiered in June 2011, with an increased spending budget. As a result, State Farm’s brand awareness and favorability has gone up considerably. This campaign focuses on making humor out of unfortunate problems that are commonly faced. These commercials then make light of the situation by demonstrating how easy it is to contact an agent and correct the problem that has occurred. Each of these commercials follows a similar structure. A group of one to three people find themselves in an unfortunate situation. Someone in the group will then call on their State Farm agent by singing the jingle “like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”. A State Farm agent will then appear and help the group out with their problem. There are a few commercials that deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.[citation needed]
State Farm also has commercials beginning with the words "State of..." and another word describing the certain commercial. One notable commercial shows a man awake at 3:00 in the morning on the phone with a State Farm representative. This certain commercial begins with State of Unrest. The man's wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: "It's Jake from State Farm". The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, "What are you wearing, 'Jake from State Farm?'", to which the agent responds in a timid way, "Uh, khakis". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, "She sounds hideous", where the husband replies, "Well she's a guy, so…"[15] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.
In late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will "never" do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those. At the end of the commercial, he admits that he is "never letting go." The commercial is based on the saying "never say never" and how people say that they will "never" do something, only to do it anyway.[16]
The Hoopers[edit]
The Hoopers is a series of State Farm commercials focusing on a family, including NBA players Chris Paul playing the father, DeAndre Jordan playing the mother, Kevin Love playing the son, Kevin Garnett playing the grandfather and Damian Lillard playing the baby. Additionally, a State Farm agent plays the role of a helpful neighbor in the set of commercials.[17]
The commercial series currently has four commercials made, including "Robbed","Dropping Dimes", "No Good Clipper" and "The Hawks and The Hornets".

Financial services[edit]
State Farm has expanded into the financial services arena, such as banking and mutual funds.
The bank opened in May 1999 and is operated by State Farm Financial Services, FSB, a subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. These are separate from its insurance products. State Farm Bank does not have branch offices. Its regular banking services, which include checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts, are available to consumers countrywide via the Internet or over the phone, and through agents. Home mortgages are available countrywide over the phone or through agents.[18]
Back in the 1950s, State Farm held a contest, among the agents, to come up with ideas to expand the State Farm business. Robert H Kent, agent in Chicago, came up with the idea of providing auto loans to existing policyholders. Robert H Kent was friends with a local bank president at LaSalle NW, and the two teamed up to pilot the auto finance program. State Farm liked the idea so much, that it was rolled out to all the agents. Robert H Kent received royalties on the program for 20 years. This is a significant event, as it created the first marketing partnership between insurance companies and banks.
Florida threatened withdrawal[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2009)


In early 2009, the State Farm Florida subsidiary, the state's largest insurer, threatened to withdraw from writing property insurance business in Florida after state regulators refused to approve a 47% property rate increase. State Farm said that, in Florida, it had paid out $1.21 in claims for every dollar in premiums since 2000. Several other home insurers have pulled out of Florida as well; many homeowners are now using the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation run by the state government.[19] State Farm has since decided to remain in Florida, although with a reduced amount of property policies.[20]
In 2010, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. which insured more than 3.5 million homes in 2010.[21]
Criticism[edit]
A 2007 investigation by CNN reported that major car insurance companies, including State Farm and Allstate Insurance, are increasingly fighting claims from those alleging injury. Some injured parties argued these were unfair practices. State Farm and Allstate have denied these allegations.[22] This followed on the heels of criminal investigations by the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, alleging that State Farm had wrongly denied claims stemming from Hurricane Katrina.[23] Plaintiff's attorney Richard F "Dickie" Scruggs later pleaded guilty in March for his role in trying to pay Judge Henry Lackey of Mississippi a $50,000 bribe for a favorable ruling in a related case involving a $26.5 million settlement after Hurricane Katrina.[24]
Competition[edit]
State Farm's top automobile insurance competitors, based on premium written, include Farmers Insurance, Allstate, Progressive, GEICO, Zurich Financial Services, Reliance Partners, Nationwide, USAA, Liberty Mutual, American International Group, and American Family Insurance Group.[25]

Each of these commercials follows a similar structure. A group of one to three people find themselves in an unfortunate situation. Someone in the group will then call on their State Farm agent by singing the jingle “like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”. A State Farm agent will then appear and help the group out with their problem. There are a few commercials that deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.[citation needed]
State Farm also has commercials beginning with the words "State of..." and another word describing the certain commercial. One notable commercial shows a man awake at 3:00 in the morning on the phone with a State Farm representative. This certain commercial begins with State of Unrest. The man's wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: "It's Jake from State Farm". The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, "What are you wearing, 'Jake from State Farm?'", to which the agent responds in a timid way, "Uh, khakis". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, "She sounds hideous", where the husband replies, "Well she's a guy, so…"[15] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.
In late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will "never" do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those. At the end of the commercial, he admits that he is "never letting go." The commercial is based on the saying "never say never" and how people say that they will "never" do something, only to do it anyway.[16]
The Hoopers[edit]
The Hoopers is a series of State Farm commercials focusing on a family, including NBA players Chris Paul playing the father, DeAndre Jordan playing the mother, Kevin Love playing the son, Kevin Garnett playing the grandfather and Damian Lillard playing the baby. Additionally, a State Farm agent plays the role of a helpful neighbor in the set of commercials.[17]
The commercial series currently has four commercials made, including "Robbed","Dropping Dimes", "No Good Clipper" and "The Hawks and The Hornets".

Financial services[edit]
State Farm has expanded into the financial services arena, such as banking and mutual funds.
The bank opened in May 1999 and is operated by State Farm Financial Services, FSB, a subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. These are separate from its insurance products. State Farm Bank does not have branch offices. Its regular banking services, which include checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts, are available to consumers countrywide via the Internet or over the phone, and through agents. Home mortgages are available countrywide over the phone or through agents.[18]
Back in the 1950s, State Farm held a contest, among the agents, to come up with ideas to expand the State Farm business. Robert H Kent, agent in Chicago, came up with the idea of providing auto loans to existing policyholders. Robert H Kent was friends with a local bank president at LaSalle NW, and the two teamed up to pilot the auto finance program. State Farm liked the idea so much, that it was rolled out to all the agents. Robert H Kent received royalties on the program for 20 years. This is a significant event, as it created the first marketing partnership between insurance companies and banks.
Florida threatened withdrawal[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2009)


In early 2009, the State Farm Florida subsidiary, the state's largest insurer, threatened to withdraw from writing property insurance business in Florida after state regulators refused to approve a 47% property rate increase. State Farm said that, in Florida, it had paid out $1.21 in claims for every dollar in premiums since 2000. Several other home insurers have pulled out of Florida as well; many homeowners are now using the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation run by the state government.[19] State Farm has since decided to remain in Florida, although with a reduced amount of property policies.[20]
In 2010, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. which insured more than 3.5 million homes in 2010.[21]
Criticism[edit]
A 2007 investigation by CNN reported that major car insurance companies, including State Farm and Allstate Insurance, are increasingly fighting claims from those alleging injury. Some injured parties argued these were unfair practices. State Farm and Allstate have denied these allegations.[22] This followed on the heels of criminal investigations by the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, alleging that State Farm had wrongly denied claims stemming from Hurricane Katrina.[23] Plaintiff's attorney Richard F "Dickie" Scruggs later pleaded guilty in March for his role in trying to pay Judge Henry Lackey of Mississippi a $50,000 bribe for a favorable ruling in a related case involving a $26.5 million settlement after Hurricane Katrina.[24]
Competition[edit]
State Farm's top automobile insurance competitors, based on premium written, include Farmers Insurance, Allstate, Progressive, GEICO, Zurich Financial Services, Reliance Partners, Nationwide, USAA, Liberty Mutual, American International Group, and American Family Insurance Group.[25]

History[edit]




State Farm Insurance in Ontario.


State Farm was founded in 1922 by retired farmer George J. Mecherle as a mutual automobile insurance company owned by its policyholders. The firm specialized in auto insurance for farmers, and later expanded its services into other types of insurance, such as homeowners and life insurance, and to banking and financial services.
The State Farm jingle ("Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there") was written by American songwriter Barry Manilow in 1971. A cover was released by Weezer in 2011.[8][9] In the 1960s State Farm's first commercial jingle was originally created for The Jack Benny Program.[10]
As of December 2013 State Farm had 65,000 employees and 18,000 agents. February 2014 figures show the group servicing 80 million policies in the United States and Canada, of which over 44,000,000 are for automobiles, 27,000,000 are for fire, 7,000,000 for life, and more than 2 million bank accounts.
Michael Tipsord is Chairman and CEO of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,[2] and president and chief executive officer of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, State Farm Life Insurance Company, and other principal State Farm affiliates.[citation needed]
In 2014, the company sold its operations in Canada to Desjardins Group. Canadian policies were transferred to be underwritten by Desjardins Group on January 1, 2015. The State Farm brand continues to be used for agents and marketing.[7][11]
Logo[edit]




State Farm's tri-oval logo from 1953 to 2012.


The State Farm interlocked tri-oval logo was created in the mid-to-late 1940s and was updated in 1953. For nearly 60 years, this design was critical to its brand image.
On December 23, 2011, State Farm decided to transform its interlocked tri-oval logo to a contemporary logo to showcase the company’s core service offerings of auto, fire, and life. The new logo was introduced January 1, 2012, marking the company’s 90th anniversary. It consists of a simple three-oval design adjacent to the State Farm wordmark. According to Pam El, Marketing Vice President at State Farm, a change in image was needed to employ a bolder presence that could compete in today’s digital world.[12]

Advertisement[edit]
This commercial structure is from State Farm's "Get to a Better State" campaign that premiered in June 2011, with an increased spending budget. As a result, State Farm’s brand awareness and favorability has gone up considerably. This campaign focuses on making humor out of unfortunate problems that are commonly faced. These commercials then make light of the situation by demonstrating how easy it is to contact an agent and correct the problem that has occurred.

A State Farm agent will then appear and help the group out with their problem. There are a few commercials that deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.[citation needed]
State Farm also has commercials beginning with the words "State of..." and another word describing the certain commercial. One notable commercial shows a man awake at 3:00 in the morning on the phone with a State Farm representative. This certain commercial begins with State of Unrest. The man's wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: "It's Jake from State Farm". The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, "What are you wearing, 'Jake from State Farm?'", to which the agent responds in a timid way, "Uh, khakis". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, "She sounds hideous", where the husband replies, "Well she's a guy, so…"[15] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.
In late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will "never" do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those.

History[edit]




State Farm Insurance in Ontario.


State Farm was founded in 1922 by retired farmer George J. Mecherle as a mutual automobile insurance company owned by its policyholders. The firm specialized in auto insurance for farmers, and later expanded its services into other types of insurance, such as homeowners and life insurance, and to banking and financial services.
The State Farm jingle ("Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there") was written by American songwriter Barry Manilow in 1971. A cover was released by Weezer in 2011.[8][9] In the 1960s State Farm's first commercial jingle was originally created for The Jack Benny Program.[10]
As of December 2013 State Farm had 65,000 employees and 18,000 agents. February 2014 figures show the group servicing 80 million policies in the United States and Canada, of which over 44,000,000 are for automobiles, 27,000,000 are for fire, 7,000,000 for life, and more than 2 million bank accounts.
Michael Tipsord is Chairman and CEO of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,[2] and president and chief executive officer of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, State Farm Life Insurance Company, and other principal State Farm affiliates.[citation needed]
In 2014, the company sold its operations in Canada to Desjardins Group. Canadian policies were transferred to be underwritten by Desjardins Group on January 1, 2015. The State Farm brand continues to be used for agents and marketing.[7][11]
Logo[edit]




State Farm's tri-oval logo from 1953 to 2012.


The State Farm interlocked tri-oval logo was created in the mid-to-late 1940s and was updated in 1953. For nearly 60 years, this design was critical to its brand image.
On December 23, 2011, State Farm decided to transform its interlocked tri-oval logo to a contemporary logo to showcase the company’s core service offerings of auto, fire, and life. The new logo was introduced January 1, 2012, marking the company’s 90th anniversary. It consists of a simple three-oval design adjacent to the State Farm wordmark. According to Pam El, Marketing Vice President at State Farm, a change in image was needed to employ a bolder presence that could compete in today’s digital world.[12]

Advertisement[edit]
This commercial structure is from State Farm's "Get to a Better State" campaign that premiered in June 2011, with an increased spending budget. As a result, State Farm’s brand awareness and favorability has gone up considerably. This campaign focuses on making humor out of unfortunate problems that are commonly faced. These commercials then make light of the situation by demonstrating how easy it is to contact an agent and correct the problem that has occurred. Each of these commercials follows a similar structure. A group of one to three people find themselves in an unfortunate situation. Someone in the group will then call on their State Farm agent by singing the jingle “like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”. A State Farm agent will then appear and help the group out with their problem. There are a few commercials that deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.[citation needed]
State Farm also has commercials beginning with the words "State of..." and another word describing the certain commercial. One notable commercial shows a man awake at 3:00 in the morning on the phone with a State Farm representative. This certain commercial begins with State of Unrest. The man's wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: "It's Jake from State Farm". The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, "What are you wearing, 'Jake from State Farm?'", to which the agent responds in a timid way, "Uh, khakis". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, "She sounds hideous", where the husband replies, "Well she's a guy, so…"[15] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.
In late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will "never" do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those. At the end of the commercial, he admits that he is "never letting go." The commercial is based on the saying "never say never" and how people say that they will "never" do something, only to do it anyway.[16]
The Hoopers[edit]
The Hoopers is a series of State Farm commercials focusing on a family, including NBA players Chris Paul playing the father, DeAndre Jordan playing the mother, Kevin Love playing the son, Kevin Garnett playing the grandfather and Damian Lillard playing the baby. Additionally, a State Farm agent plays the role of a helpful neighbor in the set of commercials.[17]
The commercial series currently has four commercials made, including "Robbed","Dropping Dimes", "No Good Clipper" and "The Hawks and The Hornets".

Financial services[edit]
State Farm has expanded into the financial services arena, such as banking and mutual funds.
The bank opened in May 1999 and is operated by State Farm Financial Services, FSB, a subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. These are separate from its insurance products. State Farm Bank does not have branch offices. Its regular banking services, which include checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts, are available to consumers countrywide via the Internet or over the phone, and through agents. Home mortgages are available countrywide over the phone or through agents.[18]
Back in the 1950s, State Farm held a contest, among the agents, to come up with ideas to expand the State Farm business. Robert H Kent, agent in Chicago, came up with the idea of providing auto loans to existing policyholders. Robert H Kent was friends with a local bank president at LaSalle NW, and the two teamed up to pilot the auto finance program. State Farm liked the idea so much, that it was rolled out to all the agents. Robert H Kent received royalties on the program for 20 years. This is a significant event, as it created the first marketing partnership between insurance companies and banks.
Florida threatened withdrawal[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2009)


In early 2009, the State Farm Florida subsidiary, the state's largest insurer, threatened to withdraw from writing property insurance business in Florida after state regulators refused to approve a 47% property rate increase. State Farm said that, in Florida, it had paid out $1.21 in claims for every dollar in premiums since 2000. Several other home insurers have pulled out of Florida as well; many homeowners are now using the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation run by the state government.[19] State Farm has since decided to remain in Florida, although with a reduced amount of property policies.[20]
In 2010, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. which insured more than 3.5 million homes in 2010.[21]
Criticism[edit]
A 2007 investigation by CNN reported that major car insurance companies, including State Farm and Allstate Insurance, are increasingly fighting claims from those alleging injury. Some injured parties argued these were unfair practices. State Farm and Allstate have denied these allegations.[22] This followed on the heels of criminal investigations by the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, alleging that State Farm had wrongly denied claims stemming from Hurricane Katrina.[23] Plaintiff's attorney Richard F "Dickie" Scruggs later pleaded guilty in March for his role in trying to pay Judge Henry Lackey of Mississippi a $50,000 bribe for a favorable ruling in a related case involving a $26.5 million settlement after Hurricane Katrina.[24]
Competition[edit]
State Farm's top automobile insurance competitors, based on premium written, include Farmers Insurance, Allstate, Progressive, GEICO, Zurich Financial Services, Reliance Partners, Nationwide, USAA, Liberty Mutual, American International Group, and American Family Insurance Group.[25]

History[edit]




State Farm Insurance in Ontario.


State Farm was founded in 1922 by retired farmer George J. Mecherle as a mutual automobile insurance company owned by its policyholders. The firm specialized in auto insurance for farmers, and later expanded its services into other types of insurance, such as homeowners and life insurance, and to banking and financial services.
The State Farm jingle ("Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there") was written by American songwriter Barry Manilow in 1971. A cover was released by Weezer in 2011.[8][9] In the 1960s State Farm's first commercial jingle was originally created for The Jack Benny Program.[10]
As of December 2013 State Farm had 65,000 employees and 18,000 agents. February 2014 figures show the group servicing 80 million policies in the United States and Canada, of which over 44,000,000 are for automobiles, 27,000,000 are for fire, 7,000,000 for life, and more than 2 million bank accounts.
Michael Tipsord is Chairman and CEO of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,[2] and president and chief executive officer of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, State Farm Life Insurance Company, and other principal State Farm affiliates.[citation needed]
In 2014, the company sold its operations in Canada to Desjardins Group. Canadian policies were transferred to be underwritten by Desjardins Group on January 1, 2015. The State Farm brand continues to be used for agents and marketing.[7][11]
Logo[edit]




State Farm's tri-oval logo from 1953 to 2012.


The State Farm interlocked tri-oval logo was created in the mid-to-late 1940s and was updated in 1953. For nearly 60 years, this design was critical to its brand image.
On December 23, 2011, State Farm decided to transform its interlocked tri-oval logo to a contemporary logo to showcase the company’s core service offerings of auto, fire, and life. The new logo was introduced January 1, 2012, marking the company’s 90th anniversary. It consists of a simple three-oval design adjacent to the State Farm wordmark. According to Pam El, Marketing Vice President at State Farm, a change in image was needed to employ a bolder presence that could compete in today’s digital world.[12]

Advertisement[edit]
This commercial structure is from State Farm's "Get to a Better State" campaign that premiered in June 2011, with an increased spending budget. As a result, State Farm’s brand awareness and favorability has gone up considerably. This campaign focuses on making humor out of unfortunate problems that are commonly faced. These commercials then make light of the situation by demonstrating how easy it is to contact an agent and correct the problem that has occurred. Each of these commercials follows a similar structure. A group of one to three people find themselves in an unfortunate situation. Someone in the group will then call on their State Farm agent by singing the jingle “like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”. A State Farm agent will then appear and help the group out with their problem. There are a few commercials that deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.[citation needed]
State Farm also has commercials beginning with the words "State of..." and another word describing the certain commercial. One notable commercial shows a man awake at 3:00 in the morning on the phone with a State Farm representative. This certain commercial begins with State of Unrest. The man's wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: "It's Jake from State Farm". The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, "What are you wearing, 'Jake from State Farm?'", to which the agent responds in a timid way, "Uh, khakis". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, "She sounds hideous", where the husband replies, "Well she's a guy, so…"[15] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.
In late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will "never" do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those. At the end of the commercial, he admits that he is "never letting go." The commercial is based on the saying "never say never" and how people say that they will "never" do something, only to do it anyway.[16]
The Hoopers[edit]
The Hoopers is a series of State Farm commercials focusing on a family, including NBA players Chris Paul playing the father, DeAndre Jordan playing the mother, Kevin Love playing the son, Kevin Garnett playing the grandfather and Damian Lillard playing the baby. Additionally, a State Farm agent plays the role of a helpful neighbor in the set of commercials.[17]
The commercial series currently has four commercials made, including "Robbed","Dropping Dimes", "No Good Clipper" and "The Hawks and The Hornets".

Financial services[edit]
State Farm has expanded into the financial services arena, such as banking and mutual funds.
The bank opened in May 1999 and is operated by State Farm Financial Services, FSB, a subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. These are separate from its insurance products. State Farm Bank does not have branch offices. Its regular banking services, which include checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts, are available to consumers countrywide via the Internet or over the phone, and through agents. Home mortgages are available countrywide over the phone or through agents.[18]
Back in the 1950s, State Farm held a contest, among the agents, to come up with ideas to expand the State Farm business. Robert H Kent, agent in Chicago, came up with the idea of providing auto loans to existing policyholders. Robert H Kent was friends with a local bank president at LaSalle NW, and the two teamed up to pilot the auto finance program. State Farm liked the idea so much, that it was rolled out to all the agents. Robert H Kent received royalties on the program for 20 years. This is a significant event, as it created the first marketing partnership between insurance companies and banks.
Florida threatened withdrawal[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2009)


In early 2009, the State Farm Florida subsidiary, the state's largest insurer, threatened to withdraw from writing property insurance business in Florida after state regulators refused to approve a 47% property rate increase. State Farm said that, in Florida, it had paid out $1.21 in claims for every dollar in premiums since 2000. Several other home insurers have pulled out of Florida as well; many homeowners are now using the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation run by the state government.[19] State Farm has since decided to remain in Florida, although with a reduced amount of property policies.[20]
In 2010, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. which insured more than 3.5 million homes in 2010.[21]
Criticism[edit]
A 2007 investigation by CNN reported that major car insurance companies, including State Farm and Allstate Insurance, are increasingly fighting claims from those alleging injury. Some injured parties argued these were unfair practices. State Farm and Allstate have denied these allegations.[22] This followed on the heels of criminal investigations by the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, alleging that State Farm had wrongly denied claims stemming from Hurricane Katrina.[23] Plaintiff's attorney Richard F "Dickie" Scruggs later pleaded guilty in March for his role in trying to pay Judge Henry Lackey of Mississippi a $50,000 bribe for a favorable ruling in a related case involving a $26.5 million settlement after Hurricane Katrina.[24]
Competition[edit]
State Farm's top automobile insurance competitors, based on premium written, include Farmers Insurance, Allstate, Progressive, GEICO, Zurich Financial Services, Reliance Partners, Nationwide, USAA, Liberty Mutual, American International Group, and American Family Insurance Group.[25]

History[edit]




State Farm Insurance in Ontario.


State Farm was founded in 1922 by retired farmer George J. Mecherle as a mutual automobile insurance company owned by its policyholders. The firm specialized in auto insurance for farmers, and later expanded its services into other types of insurance, such as homeowners and life insurance, and to banking and financial services.
The State Farm jingle ("Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there") was written by American songwriter Barry Manilow in 1971. A cover was released by Weezer in 2011.[8][9] In the 1960s State Farm's first commercial jingle was originally created for The Jack Benny Program.[10]
As of December 2013 State Farm had 65,000 employees and 18,000 agents. February 2014 figures show the group servicing 80 million policies in the United States and Canada, of which over 44,000,000 are for automobiles, 27,000,000 are for fire, 7,000,000 for life, and more than 2 million bank accounts.
Michael Tipsord is Chairman and CEO of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,[2] and president and chief executive officer of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, State Farm Life Insurance Company, and other principal State Farm affiliates.[citation needed]
In 2014, the company sold its operations in Canada to Desjardins Group. Canadian policies were transferred to be underwritten by Desjardins Group on January 1, 2015. The State Farm brand continues to be used for agents and marketing.[7][11]
Logo[edit]




State Farm's tri-oval logo from 1953 to 2012.


The State Farm interlocked tri-oval logo was created in the mid-to-late 1940s and was updated in 1953. For nearly 60 years, this design was critical to its brand image.
On December 23, 2011, State Farm decided to transform its interlocked tri-oval logo to a contemporary logo to showcase the company’s core service offerings of auto, fire, and life. The new logo was introduced January 1, 2012, marking the company’s 90th anniversary. It consists of a simple three-oval design adjacent to the State Farm wordmark. According to Pam El, Marketing Vice President at State Farm, a change in image was needed to employ a bolder presence that could compete in today’s digital world.[12]

Advertisement[edit]
This commercial structure is from State Farm's "Get to a Better State" campaign that premiered in June 2011, with an increased spending budget. As a result, State Farm’s brand awareness and favorability has gone up considerably. This campaign focuses on making humor out of unfortunate problems that are commonly faced. These commercials then make light of the situation by demonstrating how easy it is to contact an agent and correct the problem that has occurred. Each of these commercials follows a similar structure. A group of one to three people find themselves in an unfortunate situation. Someone in the group will then call on their State Farm agent by singing the jingle “like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”. A State Farm agent will then appear and help the group out with their problem. There are a few commercials that deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.[citation needed]
State Farm also has commercials beginning with the words "State of..." and another word describing the certain commercial. One notable commercial shows a man awake at 3:00 in the morning on the phone with a State Farm representative. This certain commercial begins with State of Unrest. The man's wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: "It's Jake from State Farm". The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, "What are you wearing, 'Jake from State Farm?'", to which the agent responds in a timid way, "Uh, khakis". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, "She sounds hideous", where the husband replies, "Well she's a guy, so…"[15] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.
In late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will "never" do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those. At the end of the commercial, he admits that he is "never letting go." The commercial is based on the saying "never say never" and how people say that they will "never" do something, only to do it anyway.[16]
The Hoopers[edit]
The Hoopers is a series of State Farm commercials focusing on a family, including NBA players Chris Paul playing the father, DeAndre Jordan playing the mother, Kevin Love playing the son, Kevin Garnett playing the grandfather and Damian Lillard playing the baby. Additionally, a State Farm agent plays the role of a helpful neighbor in the set of commercials.[17]
The commercial series currently has four commercials made, including "Robbed","Dropping Dimes", "No Good Clipper" and "The Hawks and The Hornets".

Financial services[edit]
State Farm has expanded into the financial services arena, such as banking and mutual funds.
The bank opened in May 1999 and is operated by State Farm Financial Services, FSB, a subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. These are separate from its insurance products. State Farm Bank does not have branch offices. Its regular banking services, which include checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts, are available to consumers countrywide via the Internet or over the phone, and through agents. Home mortgages are available countrywide over the phone or through agents.[18]
Back in the 1950s, State Farm held a contest, among the agents, to come up with ideas to expand the State Farm business. Robert H Kent, agent in Chicago, came up with the idea of providing auto loans to existing policyholders. Robert H Kent was friends with a local bank president at LaSalle NW, and the two teamed up to pilot the auto finance program. State Farm liked the idea so much, that it was rolled out to all the agents. Robert H Kent received royalties on the program for 20 years. This is a significant event, as it created the first marketing partnership between insurance companies and banks.
Florida threatened withdrawal[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2009)


In early 2009, the State Farm Florida subsidiary, the state's largest insurer, threatened to withdraw from writing property insurance business in Florida after state regulators refused to approve a 47% property rate increase. State Farm said that, in Florida, it had paid out $1.21 in claims for every dollar in premiums since 2000. Several other home insurers have pulled out of Florida as well; many homeowners are now using the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation run by the state government.[19] State Farm has since decided to remain in Florida, although with a reduced amount of property policies.[20]
In 2010, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. which insured more than 3.5 million homes in 2010.[21]
Criticism[edit]
A 2007 investigation by CNN reported that major car insurance companies, including State Farm and Allstate Insurance, are increasingly fighting claims from those alleging injury. Some injured parties argued these were unfair practices. State Farm and Allstate have denied these allegations.[22] This followed on the heels of criminal investigations by the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, alleging that State Farm had wrongly denied claims stemming from Hurricane Katrina.[23] Plaintiff's attorney Richard F "Dickie" Scruggs later pleaded guilty in March for his role in trying to pay Judge Henry Lackey of Mississippi a $50,000 bribe for a favorable ruling in a related case involving a $26.5 million settlement after Hurricane Katrina.[24]
Competition[edit]
State Farm's top automobile insurance competitors, based on premium written, include Farmers Insurance, Allstate, Progressive, GEICO, Zurich Financial Services, Reliance Partners, Nationwide, USAA, Liberty Mutual, American International Group, and American Family Insurance Group.[25]

The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, "What are you wearing, 'Jake from State Farm?'", to which the agent responds in a timid way, "Uh, khakis". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, "She sounds hideous", where the husband replies, "Well she's a guy, so…"[15] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.
In late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will "never" do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those. At the end of the commercial, he admits that he is "never letting go." The commercial is based on the saying "never say never" and how people say that they will "never" do something, only to do it anyway.[16]
The Hoopers[edit]
The Hoopers is a series of State Farm commercials focusing on a family, including NBA players Chris Paul playing the father, DeAndre Jordan playing the mother, Kevin Love playing the son, Kevin Garnett playing the grandfather and Damian Lillard playing the baby. Additionally, a State Farm agent plays the role of a helpful neighbor in the set of commercials.[17]
The commercial series currently has four commercials made, including "Robbed","Dropping Dimes", "No Good Clipper" and "The Hawks and The Hornets".

Financial services[edit]
State Farm has expanded into the financial services arena, such as banking and mutual funds.
The bank opened in May 1999 and is operated by State Farm Financial Services, FSB, a subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. These are separate from its insurance products. State Farm Bank does not have branch offices. Its regular banking services, which include checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts, are available to consumers countrywide via the Internet or over the phone, and through agents. Home mortgages are available countrywide over the phone or through agents.[18]
Back in the 1950s, State Farm held a contest, among the agents, to come up with ideas to expand the State Farm business. Robert H Kent, agent in Chicago, came up with the idea of providing auto loans to existing policyholders. Robert H Kent was friends with a local bank president at LaSalle NW, and the two teamed up to pilot the auto finance program. State Farm liked the idea so much, that it was rolled out to all the agents. Robert H Kent received royalties on the program for 20 years. This is a significant event, as it created the first marketing partnership between insurance companies and banks.
Florida threatened withdrawal[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2009)


In early 2009, the State Farm Florida subsidiary, the state's largest insurer, threatened to withdraw from writing property insurance business in Florida after state regulators refused to approve a 47% property rate increase. State Farm said that, in Florida, it had paid out $1.21 in claims for every dollar in premiums since 2000. Several other home insurers have pulled out of Florida as well; many homeowners are now using the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation run by the state government.[19] State Farm has since decided to remain in Florida, although with a reduced amount of property policies.[20]
In 2010, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. which insured more than 3.5 million homes in 2010.[21]
Criticism[edit]
A 2007 investigation by CNN reported that major car insurance companies, including State Farm and Allstate Insurance, are increasingly fighting claims from those alleging injury. Some injured parties argued these were unfair practices. State Farm and Allstate have denied these allegations.[22] This followed on the heels of criminal investigations by the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, alleging that State Farm had wrongly denied claims stemming from Hurricane Katrina.[23] Plaintiff's attorney Richard F "Dickie" Scruggs later pleaded guilty in March for his role in trying to pay Judge Henry Lackey of Mississippi a $50,000 bribe for a favorable ruling in a related case involving a $26.5 million settlement after Hurricane Katrina.[24]
Competition[edit]
State Farm's top automobile insurance competitors, based on premium written, include Farmers Insurance, Allstate, Progressive, GEICO, Zurich Financial Services, Reliance Partners, Nationwide, USAA, Liberty Mutual, American International Group, and American Family Insurance Group.[25]

History[edit]




State Farm Insurance in Ontario.


State Farm was founded in 1922 by retired farmer George J. Mecherle as a mutual automobile insurance company owned by its policyholders. The firm specialized in auto insurance for farmers, and later expanded its services into other types of insurance, such as homeowners and life insurance, and to banking and financial services.
The State Farm jingle ("Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there") was written by American songwriter Barry Manilow in 1971. A cover was released by Weezer in 2011.[8][9] In the 1960s State Farm's first commercial jingle was originally created for The Jack Benny Program.[10]
As of December 2013 State Farm had 65,000 employees and 18,000 agents. February 2014 figures show the group servicing 80 million policies in the United States and Canada, of which over 44,000,000 are for automobiles, 27,000,000 are for fire, 7,000,000 for life, and more than 2 million bank accounts.
Michael Tipsord is Chairman and CEO of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,[2] and president and chief executive officer of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, State Farm Life Insurance Company, and other principal State Farm affiliates.[citation needed]
In 2014, the company sold its operations in Canada to Desjardins Group. Canadian policies were transferred to be underwritten by Desjardins Group on January 1, 2015. The State Farm brand continues to be used for agents and marketing.[7][11]
Logo[edit]




State Farm's tri-oval logo from 1953 to 2012.


The State Farm interlocked tri-oval logo was created in the mid-to-late 1940s and was updated in 1953. For nearly 60 years, this design was critical to its brand image.
On December 23, 2011, State Farm decided to transform its interlocked tri-oval logo to a contemporary logo to showcase the company’s core service offerings of auto, fire, and life. The new logo was introduced January 1, 2012, marking the company’s 90th anniversary. It consists of a simple three-oval design adjacent to the State Farm wordmark. According to Pam El, Marketing Vice President at State Farm, a change in image was needed to employ a bolder presence that could compete in today’s digital world.[12]

Advertisement[edit]
This commercial structure is from State Farm's "Get to a Better State" campaign that premiered in June 2011, with an increased spending budget. As a result, State Farm’s brand awareness and favorability has gone up considerably. This campaign focuses on making humor out of unfortunate problems that are commonly faced. These commercials then make light of the situation by demonstrating how easy it is to contact an agent and correct the problem that has occurred. Each of these commercials follows a similar structure. A group of one to three people find themselves in an unfortunate situation. Someone in the group will then call on their State Farm agent by singing the jingle “like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”. A State Farm agent will then appear and help the group out with their problem. There are a few commercials that deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.[citation needed]
State Farm also has commercials beginning with the words "State of..." and another word describing the certain commercial. One notable commercial shows a man awake at 3:00 in the morning on the phone with a State Farm representative. This certain commercial begins with State of Unrest. The man's wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: "It's Jake from State Farm". The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, "What are you wearing, 'Jake from State Farm?'", to which the agent responds in a timid way, "Uh, khakis". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, "She sounds hideous", where the husband replies, "Well she's a guy, so…"[15] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.
In late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will "never" do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those. At the end of the commercial, he admits that he is "never letting go." The commercial is based on the saying "never say never" and how people say that they will "never" do something, only to do it anyway.[16]
The Hoopers[edit]
The Hoopers is a series of State Farm commercials focusing on a family, including NBA players Chris Paul playing the father, DeAndre Jordan playing the mother, Kevin Love playing the son, Kevin Garnett playing the grandfather and Damian Lillard playing the baby. Additionally, a State Farm agent plays the role of a helpful neighbor in the set of commercials.[17]
The commercial series currently has four commercials made, including "Robbed","Dropping Dimes", "No Good Clipper" and "The Hawks and The Hornets".

State Farm Safety Patrol – State Farm, in partnership with several U.S. highway authorities, operates a service called the State Farm Safety Patrol which provides free roadside assistance to stranded motorists on participating highways, when you call the designated telephone number for the Safety Patrol they will respond and provide the following services: fuel refills; radiator refills; engine oil refills. Most Safety Patrol personnel are also CPR and Automated External Defibrillator certified. They work to reduce accident rates, minimize the duration time of incidents, assist disabled drivers and remove road debris. Turnpikes which currently participate include, Florida's Turnpike in the State of Florida[26] and the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.[27] In Ohio, State Farm–branded safety patrol vans service major highways in the Cincinnati, Toledo, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Akron, and Canton areas on weekdays.[28]

History[edit]




State Farm Insurance in Ontario.


State Farm was founded in 1922 by retired farmer George J. Mecherle as a mutual automobile insurance company owned by its policyholders. The firm specialized in auto insurance for farmers, and later expanded its services into other types of insurance, such as homeowners and life insurance, and to banking and financial services.
The State Farm jingle ("Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there") was written by American songwriter Barry Manilow in 1971. A cover was released by Weezer in 2011.[8][9] In the 1960s State Farm's first commercial jingle was originally created for The Jack Benny Program.[10]
As of December 2013 State Farm had 65,000 employees and 18,000 agents. February 2014 figures show the group servicing 80 million policies in the United States and Canada, of which over 44,000,000 are for automobiles, 27,000,000 are for fire, 7,000,000 for life, and more than 2 million bank accounts.
Michael Tipsord is Chairman and CEO of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,[2] and president and chief executive officer of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, State Farm Life Insurance Company, and other principal State Farm affiliates.[citation needed]
In 2014, the company sold its operations in Canada to Desjardins Group. Canadian policies were transferred to be underwritten by Desjardins Group on January 1, 2015. The State Farm brand continues to be used for agents and marketing.[7][11]
Logo[edit]




State Farm's tri-oval logo from 1953 to 2012.


The State Farm interlocked tri-oval logo was created in the mid-to-late 1940s and was updated in 1953. For nearly 60 years, this design was critical to its brand image.
On December 23, 2011, State Farm decided to transform its interlocked tri-oval logo to a contemporary logo to showcase the company’s core service offerings of auto, fire, and life. The new logo was introduced January 1, 2012, marking the company’s 90th anniversary. It consists of a simple three-oval design adjacent to the State Farm wordmark. According to Pam El, Marketing Vice President at State Farm, a change in image was needed to employ a bolder presence that could compete in today’s digital world.[12]

Advertisement[edit]
This commercial structure is from State Farm's "Get to a Better State" campaign that premiered in June 2011, with an increased spending budget. As a result, State Farm’s brand awareness and favorability has gone up considerably. This campaign focuses on making humor out of unfortunate problems that are commonly faced. These commercials then make light of the situation by demonstrating how easy it is to contact an agent and correct the problem that has occurred. Each of these commercials follows a similar structure. A group of one to three people find themselves in an unfortunate situation. Someone in the group will then call on their State Farm agent by singing the jingle “like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”. A State Farm agent will then appear and help the group out with their problem. There are a few commercials that deviate from this structure, but still follow the same ultimate pattern.[citation needed]
State Farm also has commercials beginning with the words "State of..." and another word describing the certain commercial. One notable commercial shows a man awake at 3:00 in the morning on the phone with a State Farm representative. This certain commercial begins with State of Unrest. The man's wife sees him talking on the phone in a secretive manner. She is suspicious and asks who is on the phone, to which her husband says: "It's Jake from State Farm". The man's wife then takes the phone and asks, "What are you wearing, 'Jake from State Farm?'", to which the agent responds in a timid way, "Uh, khakis". Still believing he's a female, the wife says, "She sounds hideous", where the husband replies, "Well she's a guy, so…"[15] In May 2015, a variation of State of Unrest premiered, starring The Coneheads from Saturday Night Live, with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprising their respective roles as Beldar and Prymaat. This started an ad campaign with that later added Laraine Newman as Connie.
In late 2014, State Farm released a critically acclaimed commercial showing a man (played by Justin Bartha) who says that he will "never" do something (such as getting married, having kids, moving to the suburbs, and buying a minivan), only to do all of those. At the end of the commercial, he admits that he is "never letting go." The commercial is based on the saying "never say never" and how people say that they will "never" do something, only to do it anyway.[16]
The Hoopers[edit]
The Hoopers is a series of State Farm commercials focusing on a family, including NBA players Chris Paul playing the father, DeAndre Jordan playing the mother, Kevin Love playing the son, Kevin Garnett playing the grandfather and Damian Lillard playing the baby. Additionally, a State Farm agent plays the role of a helpful neighbor in the set of commercials.[17]
The commercial series currently has four commercials made, including "Robbed","Dropping Dimes", "No Good Clipper" and "The Hawks and The Hornets".

Financial services[edit]
State Farm has expanded into the financial services arena, such as banking and mutual funds.
The bank opened in May 1999 and is operated by State Farm Financial Services, FSB, a subsidiary of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. These are separate from its insurance products. State Farm Bank does not have branch offices. Its regular banking services, which include checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market accounts, are available to consumers countrywide via the Internet or over the phone, and through agents. Home mortgages are available countrywide over the phone or through agents.[18]
Back in the 1950s, State Farm held a contest, among the agents, to come up with ideas to expand the State Farm business. Robert H Kent, agent in Chicago, came up with the idea of providing auto loans to existing policyholders. Robert H Kent was friends with a local bank president at LaSalle NW, and the two teamed up to pilot the auto finance program. State Farm liked the idea so much, that it was rolled out to all the agents. Robert H Kent received royalties on the program for 20 years. This is a significant event, as it created the first marketing partnership between insurance companies and banks.
Florida threatened withdrawal[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2009)


In early 2009, the State Farm Florida subsidiary, the state's largest insurer, threatened to withdraw from writing property insurance business in Florida after state regulators refused to approve a 47% property rate increase. State Farm said that, in Florida, it had paid out $1.21 in claims for every dollar in premiums since 2000. Several other home insurers have pulled out of Florida as well; many homeowners are now using the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation run by the state government.[19] State Farm has since decided to remain in Florida, although with a reduced amount of property policies.[20]
In 2010, State Farm and Renaissance jointly formed DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. which insured more than 3.5 million homes in 2010.[21]
Criticism[edit]
A 2007 investigation by CNN reported that major car insurance companies, including State Farm and Allstate Insurance, are increasingly fighting claims from those alleging injury. Some injured parties argued these were unfair practices. State Farm and Allstate have denied these allegations.[22] This followed on the heels of criminal investigations by the states of Louisiana and Mississippi, alleging that State Farm had wrongly denied claims stemming from Hurricane Katrina.[23] Plaintiff's attorney Richard F "Dickie" Scruggs later pleaded guilty in March for his role in trying to pay Judge Henry Lackey of Mississippi a $50,000 bribe for a favorable ruling in a related case involving a $26.5 million settlement after Hurricane Katrina.[24]
Competition[edit]
State Farm's top automobile insurance competitors, based on premium written, include Farmers Insurance, Allstate, Progressive, GEICO, Zurich Financial Services, Reliance Partners, Nationwide, USAA, Liberty Mutual, American International Group, and American Family Insurance Group.[25]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

California Earthquakes & Faults by County
Do you live near a major fault?
Nearly everyone in California lives within 30 miles of an active fault that could cause a damaging earthquake.
In fact, some 2,000 known faults criss-cross California, and scientists continue to discover new ones.
Earthquakes happen all the time
Since the magnitude 6.7 earthquake in Northridge in 1994, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), California has experienced 1,172 earthquakes with a magnitude 4.0 or greater -- including the most recent magnitude 6.0 South Napa quake.

Some of the world’s most devastating earthquakes have occurred on previously unknown faults, such as the Northridge quake.
As the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 proved, sometimes the most extensive earthquake damage can occur many miles from the fault and epicenter. The USGS reports that the most severe property damage occurred in Oakland and San Francisco, more than 60 miles from the epicenter in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

Staying Safe Where the Earth Shakes will help you understand your earthquake risk where you live, and learn how to prepare to survive and recover from the next earthquake.
What are the earthquake risks where you live?

North Coast
Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino
Our Northern California counties are full of natural beauty, along the coast and within the forests.
But like all of California, this area is earthquake country.

The Cascadia Subduction Zone stretches underneath the Humboldt-Del Norte county region, starting north of Cape Mendocino.
In April 2008, a UCERF study concluded that there is a 10 percent probability of a magnitude 8 or 9 earthquake along this zone in the next 30 years.
Very large earthquakes occurring close to the coast could affect us.
There is also a risk of tsunamis in this region. 

Life After a Big Quake 
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Shasta Cascade
 
Butte, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Tehama, Trinity
The Trinity Mountains, Modoc Plateau, Shasta and Lassen peaks were created by geologic forces which are still shaping the landscape. In addition to our volcanoes, we also live in earthquake country!
Our region lives within 20 miles of an active fault.

The Modoc Plateau has both active volcanoes and faults.
Much of the north-eastern part of the state is actively stretching apart, creating numerous faults, all capable of producing earthquakes.
Very large earthquakes that occur closer to the coast could also affect us.
Even moderate shaking can trigger landslides that can quickly block roads and highways.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Bay Area
Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma
The greater San Francisco Bay Area has a high likelihood of future damaging earthquakes. 
Most of us in the Bay Area live less than 10 miles from a major fault.

The San Andreas fault runs along the Sonoma Coast through the Santa Cruz Mountains, and the Hayward fault covers the hills on the east side of the San Francisco Bay. Both can cause damaging earthquakes.
Numerous other faults are capable of producing damaging earthquakes similar in magnitude to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
Soils in lowland areas away from major faults may also be unable to support buildings during earthquakes. Landslides are likely on hillsides.
Coastal areas are also at risk of tsunamis, generated from earthquakes on local faults or across the Pacific.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer. Access to our region may be limited.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps so that you and your family are prepared to stay safe.



Delta Sierra
Alpine, Amador, Calaveras, Colusa, El Dorado, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tuolumne, Yolo, Yuba
The Delta region and the Sierra Nevada are known for natural scenery and historic landmarks, yet we also face earthquakes.
The mountains and the valley have been shaped by repeated earthquakes on faults in the region.

Moderate magnitude earthquakes have occurred in the high Sierra, the foothills and in the Central Valley.
These occurred on active faults found in wide zones along the crest of the Sierra Nevada, through Lake Tahoe, along the foothills, and in the western Sacramento Valley.
Large quakes from distant faults such as those in the Bay Area or east of the Sierra Nevada can also cause significant damage to homes, businesses, and communities, especially in areas where water levels are high in soft soils that can settle unevenly during shaking.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Central Coast
Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz
This region has a long history of damaging earthquakes. Like most of California, this is earthquake country! 
Most of us in the Central Coast live less than 15 miles from a fault that can have a damaging earthquake.

The most frequent large earthquakes that will affect the region will occur along the San Andreas fault.
The San Gregorio fault follows the coast, usually just offshore.
Numerous other faults are capable of having moderate magnitude (but still damaging) earthquakes similar to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
Coastal areas are also at risk of tsunamis, generated from either earthquakes on local faults or across the Pacific.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Central Valley South
Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Tulare
Like all of California, the Central Valley is earthquake country. Shaking can begin suddenly but have lasting impacts. 
The Central Valley is ringed by faults.

The San Andreas fault, California’s largest, is to the west, the Garlock fault to the south, and the faults of the Sierra Nevada to the east.
The San Andreas fault will create the biggest earthquakes – as big as magnitude 8 – that will disrupt the whole region.
A smaller earthquake near you can be more damaging to your house than a magnitude 8 farther away.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Inyo/Mono
Inyo, Mono
This region has been fashioned by tremendous geologic forces, from the incredible steep slope of Mt. Whitney to the vast Owens Valley in Inyo County.
Like all of California, this is earthquake country. 

All residents of Inyo and Mono counties live less than 15 miles from a fault that can cause a damaging earthquake.
Active faults at the base of the range and within the basins to the east have caused damaging earthquakes in the past, such as the 1872 Owens Valley earthquake.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Southern California Coast
Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange
Southern Californians know this is earthquake country, but many of us have not recently experienced a damaging earthquake. 
Many of the mountains, and some of the valleys, in Southern California were formed by the San Andreas fault.

The San Andreas is the longest fault in California, slicing through Los Angeles County along the north side of the San Gabriel Mountains.
It can cause the most powerful earthquakes our area can experience – as big as magnitude 8.
There are over a hundred smaller active faults in the region that can cause damaging earthquakes like the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
Coastal areas are also at risk of tsunamis, generated from earthquakes either on local faults or across the Pacific.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Inland Southern California
Imperial, Riverside, San Bernardino
Inland Southern California has scenic mountains, valleys, and deserts. Tremendous geologic forces created this spectacular landscape and continue today, reminding us often that we live in earthquake country!
Most of us in Inland Southern California live less than 10 miles from a fault that can have a damaging earthquake.

A large part of our population lives along the most potentially damaging fault of all - the infamous San Andreas.
The San Andreas fault slices through our region and can cause a devastating earthquake.
Many other faults, such as the San Jacinto fault, create smaller, yet more frequent earthquakes.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



San Diego
Earthquakes in San Diego County
Like all of California, San Diego is earthquake country. 
Most of us in San Diego County live less than 15 miles from a fault that can have a damaging earthquake.

The Rose Canyon fault is along the coast and beneath downtown San Diego.
The Elsinore and San Jacinto faults cut through East County.
Large earthquakes on faults outside of the county can also shake us (like on Easter Sunday in 2010).
Coastal areas are also at risk of tsunamis, generated from either earthquakes on local faults or across the Pacific. 

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.

California Earthquakes & Faults by County
Do you live near a major fault?
Nearly everyone in California lives within 30 miles of an active fault that could cause a damaging earthquake.
In fact, some 2,000 known faults criss-cross California, and scientists continue to discover new ones.
Earthquakes happen all the time
Since the magnitude 6.7 earthquake in Northridge in 1994, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), California has experienced 1,172 earthquakes with a magnitude 4.0 or greater -- including the most recent magnitude 6.0 South Napa quake.

Some of the world’s most devastating earthquakes have occurred on previously unknown faults, such as the Northridge quake.
As the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 proved, sometimes the most extensive earthquake damage can occur many miles from the fault and epicenter. The USGS reports that the most severe property damage occurred in Oakland and San Francisco, more than 60 miles from the epicenter in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

Staying Safe Where the Earth Shakes will help you understand your earthquake risk where you live, and learn how to prepare to survive and recover from the next earthquake.

North Coast
Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino
Our Northern California counties are full of natural beauty, along the coast and within the forests.
But like all of California, this area is earthquake country.

The Cascadia Subduction Zone stretches underneath the Humboldt-Del Norte county region, starting north of Cape Mendocino.
In April 2008, a UCERF study concluded that there is a 10 percent probability of a magnitude 8 or 9 earthquake along this zone in the next 30 years.
Very large earthquakes occurring close to the coast could affect us.
There is also a risk of tsunamis in this region. 

Life After a Big Quake 
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Shasta Cascade
 
Butte, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Tehama, Trinity
The Trinity Mountains, Modoc Plateau, Shasta and Lassen peaks were created by geologic forces which are still shaping the landscape. In addition to our volcanoes, we also live in earthquake country!
Our region lives within 20 miles of an active fault.

The Modoc Plateau has both active volcanoes and faults.
Much of the north-eastern part of the state is actively stretching apart, creating numerous faults, all capable of producing earthquakes.
Very large earthquakes that occur closer to the coast could also affect us.
Even moderate shaking can trigger landslides that can quickly block roads and highways.

Life After a Big Quake

Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Bay Area
Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma
The greater San Francisco Bay Area has a high likelihood of future damaging earthquakes. 
Most of us in the Bay Area live less than 10 miles from a major fault.

The San Andreas fault runs along the Sonoma Coast through the Santa Cruz Mountains, and the Hayward fault covers the hills on the east side of the San Francisco Bay. Both can cause damaging earthquakes.
Numerous other faults are capable of producing damaging earthquakes similar in magnitude to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
Soils in lowland areas away from major faults may also be unable to support buildings during earthquakes. Landslides are likely on hillsides.
Coastal areas are also at risk of tsunamis, generated from earthquakes on local faults or across the Pacific.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer. Access to our region may be limited.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.
Government assistance may not be available or may not be enough to replace your damaged belongings or repair your home.
Taking steps so that you and your family are prepared to stay safe.



Delta Sierra
Alpine, Amador, Calaveras, Colusa, El Dorado, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tuolumne, Yolo, Yuba
The Delta region and the Sierra Nevada are known for natural scenery and historic landmarks, yet we also face earthquakes.
The mountains and the valley have been shaped by repeated earthquakes on faults in the region.

Moderate magnitude earthquakes have occurred in the high Sierra, the foothills and in the Central Valley.
These occurred on active faults found in wide zones along the crest of the Sierra Nevada, through Lake Tahoe, along the foothills, and in the western Sacramento Valley.
Large quakes from distant faults such as those in the Bay Area or east of the Sierra Nevada can also cause significant damage to homes, businesses, and communities, especially in areas where water levels are high in soft soils that can settle unevenly during shaking.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Central Coast
Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz
This region has a long history of damaging earthquakes. Like most of California, this is earthquake country! 
Most of us in the Central Coast live less than 15 miles from a fault that can have a damaging earthquake.

The most frequent large earthquakes that will affect the region will occur along the San Andreas fault.
The San Gregorio fault follows the coast, usually just offshore.
Numerous other faults are capable of having moderate magnitude (but still damaging) earthquakes similar to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
Coastal areas are also at risk of tsunamis, generated from either earthquakes on local faults or across the Pacific.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Central Valley South
Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Tulare
Like all of California, the Central Valley is earthquake country. Shaking can begin suddenly but have lasting impacts. 
The Central Valley is ringed by faults.

The San Andreas fault, California’s largest, is to the west, the Garlock fault to the south, and the faults of the Sierra Nevada to the east.
The San Andreas fault will create the biggest earthquakes – as big as magnitude 8 – that will disrupt the whole region.
A smaller earthquake near you can be more damaging to your house than a magnitude 8 farther away.

Inyo/Mono
Inyo, Mono
This region has been fashioned by tremendous geologic forces, from the incredible steep slope of Mt. Whitney to the vast Owens Valley in Inyo County.
Like all of California, this is earthquake country. 

All residents of Inyo and Mono counties live less than 15 miles from a fault that can cause a damaging earthquake.
Active faults at the base of the range and within the basins to the east have caused damaging earthquakes in the past, such as the 1872 Owens Valley earthquake.

Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Southern California Coast
Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange
Southern Californians know this is earthquake country, but many of us have not recently experienced a damaging earthquake. 
Many of the mountains, and some of the valleys, in Southern California were formed by the San Andreas fault.

The San Andreas is the longest fault in California, slicing through Los Angeles County along the north side of the San Gabriel Mountains.
It can cause the most powerful earthquakes our area can experience – as big as magnitude 8.
There are over a hundred smaller active faults in the region that can cause damaging earthquakes like the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
Coastal areas are also at risk of tsunamis, generated from earthquakes either on local faults or across the Pacific.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.

Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



Inland Southern California
Imperial, Riverside, San Bernardino
Inland Southern California has scenic mountains, valleys, and deserts. Tremendous geologic forces created this spectacular landscape and continue today, reminding us often that we live in earthquake country!
Most of us in Inland Southern California live less than 10 miles from a fault that can have a damaging earthquake.

A large part of our population lives along the most potentially damaging fault of all - the infamous San Andreas.
The San Andreas fault slices through our region and can cause a devastating earthquake.
Many other faults, such as the San Jacinto fault, create smaller, yet more frequent earthquakes.

Life After a Big Quake
Damaging earthquakes will disrupt services like electricity, water and sewer, and may limit access in and out of the region.

Fire and police departments will be dealing with the most serious situations and may be unable to respond quickly to issues in your community.

Taking steps now will give you confidence that you and your family are prepared to stay safe where the earth shakes.



San Diego
Earthquakes in San Diego County
Like all of California, San Diego is earthquake country. 
Most of us in San Diego County live less than 15 miles from a fault that can have a damaging earthquake.

The Rose Canyon fault is along the coast and beneath downtown San Diego.
The Elsinore and San Jacinto faults cut through East County.
Large earthquakes on faults outside of the county can also shake us (like on Easter Sunday in 2010).
Coastal areas are also at risk of tsunamis, generated from either earthquakes on local faults or across the Pacific.

CEA Information


  
Why CEA earthquake insurance? 

CEA has reduced homeowners rates since 1996 by nearly 55 percent, making earthquake insurance more affordable than ever!
As a not-for-profit, CEA rates are based on science and straightforward, objective risk factors. Determining factors are the insured value, location, construction- and foundation-types, age, number of stories and coverage choices.
 







  
Is CEA a state agency? 

No. CEA is a public instrumentality of the state. An instrumentality is an organization created by state law and operated for public purposes. Learn more about CEA’s creation after the Northridge earthquake and history.

CEA is financed solely through insurer contributions, policyholder premiums, and its own investment returns. We are a not-for-profit and receive no funding from the State of California, whether for operations or claim liabilities, and are not a part of the state budget. 
  






  
Who handles CEA applications, renewals and claims? 

Participating insurance companies and their agents process all policy applications, renewals, payments and claims. 
  






  
Who do I contact if I have questions or an earthquake damage claim? 

Participating insurance companies process all policy applications, renewals, payments and claims. CEA policyholders should contact your insurance company’s customer service or claim department regarding policy renewals, changes to an existing policy or the handling of claims. Customers make payment of CEA premiums to your insurance company, not to the CEA. 
  






  
Why doesn't CEA accept credit card payments or ACH withdrawals? 

Each CEA participating insurance company handles billing for their CEA customers, including establishing the number of installment payments and methods of payment. Customers can pay their bills using whatever payment method their participating insurance company offers. 
  






  
If I have to move out of my property due to damages caused by an earthquake, how does CEA handle this? 


If you purchased Loss of Use coverage, you are eligible for the additional living expenses necessary to maintain your normal standard of living, up to the coverage limit you selected.
If selected, Loss of Use coverage is offered in limits of $1,500, $10,000, $15,000, $25,000, $50,000, $75,000 and $100,000.
If you have a CEA Renters policy, rest easy. CEA will pay for your additional living expense, according to the policy terms, limits, and conditions, if you need to move out while your landlord makes repairs, or while you look for a new residence to move into. 
If you are a landlord and you have a CEA policy on the rental property, CEA will pay, in accordance with policy terms, limits, and conditions, the fair rental value for your rental property under the Loss of Use coverage. 








  
Can loss of use be used even if the damages do not exceed the deductible?  

Yes. Two CEA coverages come with zero deductible: the first $1,500 of emergency repairs for homeowners and mobilehome owners, and, if a home can't be occupied after an earthquake, additional living expenses up to the Loss of Use coverage you selected.  
  






  
Does CEA offer coverage for items like crystal, china and porcelain? 

You can add "breakables" coverage as an option on your policy (subject to sublimit), to cover breakable belongings such as dishes and ceramics.





CEA Financial Strength


  
Will CEA be able to pay all of its claims if there is an earthquake? 

CEA has a claim-paying capacity of more than $15 billion. Also:

CEA is financially sound, with an A- (Excellent) rating from A.M. Best Co., the world's leading rating agency of insurance companies.
CEA is privately funded. We don't receive any money from the state, so state budgets or budget deficits have no impact on our ability to pay claims.
CEA could cover all its claims if the 1906 San Francisco, 1989 Loma Prieta, or 1994 Northridge earthquake reoccurred today.
	 








  
How much claim-paying capacity does CEA have? 

CEA has more than $15 billion in claims paying capacity and has maintained an A- (Excellent) rating with A.M Best. CEA could cover all its claims if the 1906 San Francisco, 1989 Loma Prieta, or 1994 Northridge earthquake reoccurred today.

The minimum annual premium for a CEA standard Homeowners or Homeowners Choice policy is $100. Various rating factors determine your premium, such as:

Degree of earthquake risk where you live
Insured value of the house
The house's number of stories, age, and foundation and construction type
The policy coverages, limits and deductibles you choose
Whether or not the insured dwelling has been seismically retrofitted, per defined building code standards, and qualifies for the Hazard Reduction Discount

Find a homeowners policy that works with your budget and coverage needs. And use our Premium Calculator to get a policy premium estimate.







  
How much does a CEA mobilehome policy cost? 

The minimum annual premium for CEA standard Homeowners or Homeowners Choice policies is $45. Different factors determine your premium, such as:

Earthquake risk where you live.
Insured value of your mobilehome.
The policy coverages, limits and deductibles you choose.
If your mobile has an earthquake resistant bracing system or foundation system installed.

Find a Mobilehome policy that works with your budget and coverage needs. And use our Premium Calculator to get a policy estimate.







  
What's the difference between Homeowners and Homeowners Choice policies? 

CEA standard Homeowners policies include dwelling, personal property and loss of use coverage bundled together. Choice policies only require dwelling coverage; however, personal property and loss of use can be purchased as separate options, in addition to the dwelling coverage. 

Compare Homeowners Choice and standard Homeowners Policies








  
Is retrofitting required before purchasing a CEA policy?  

It is not required to have the a home retrofitted in order to purchase a CEA policy however, CEA encourages all California homeowners to reduce their risk of earthquake loss. Visit the page Your Earthquake Risk and Preparedness to learn more about preparedness.  
  




Condominium / Condo Unit Owners


  
How much does a CEA condo unit policy cost? 

The minimum annual premium for a CEA Condo Unit Owners policy is $35. Different factors determine your premium, such as:

The earthquake risk where you live.
The market value of the insured condo.
The policy coverages and deductibles you choose.

Find the coverages, limits and deductibles that work with your budget and needs. And use our Premium Calculator to get a policy estimate.







  
Does CEA offer a master earthquake policy for homeowner associations? 

No, but the CEA does offer individual condominium-unit homeowner earthquake insurance. 
  






  
If my HOA doesn't have an earthquake master policy, do I need Loss Assessment coverage? 

Your homeowners association may have insurance for common areas and the exterior and the structure of the building. But the master earthquake policy doesn't cover the inside of your unit or compensate you for loss of use. Your association may also require condo unit owners to share repair costs or pay part of the association's policy deductible through a loss assessment. To learn more about our condo unit policies, download a copy of the condo unit owners brochure. 
  






  
I own my condo unit. Are there coverage options for me? 

Condo unit owners have unique needs. Condo association master earthquake policies usually don't cover damage to your personal belongings or damage to the inside of your home. And while some associations may cover earthquake damage to a condo building's exterior or common areas,  many also require unit owners to pay a portion of the repair costs or the association's policy deductible (by levying a loss assessment). CEA offers a condo unit policy with coverage for your belongings and the interior of your condo unit, as well as loss assessment coverage. 
  






  
What is the highest limit offered for the building property for an individual condo unit owner?  

If selected, the limit on building property for an individual unit owner is $100,000. This will cover items permanently attached such as built in appliances, fixtures, and flooring. For all terms and conditions please read the CEA condominium policy. 
  






  
Is there loss assessment coverage on a CEA condo unit policy? 

Yes. Loss Assessment coverage has options up to $100,000 for an individual unit owner to help cover the cost of special assessments their Home Owners Association (HOA) may assess for the cost of repairing the unit structures, or may be used towards the HOA’s master policy deductible. For all terms and conditions please read the CEA condominium policy.  
  
  




Renters


  
How much does a CEA renters policy c​ost? 

The minimum annual premium for CEA Renters Policy is $35. Different factors determine your premium, such as:

Earthquake risk where you live.
The policy coverages, limits and deductibles you choose.

Find a Renters policy that works with your budget and coverage needs. And use our Premium Calculator to get a policy estimate.







  
I rent, so will my landlord's policy cover my belongings? 

No. If you rent, you need a separate renters policy to cover your personal belongings. CEA renters earthquake insurance insures personal property such as TVs and furniture, with deductibles ranging from 5 to 25 percent, and covers additional living expenses—if you must live and eat elsewhere following a quake—of up to $100,000 with no deductible. 
  




Deductibles and Discounts


  
What are my deductible options? 

Policyholders can choose deductibles of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% or 25% on all coverages that carry a deductible.
For Homeowners, you have two choices of policies: Homeowners Choice or standard Homeowners . With Homeowners Choice, you have the option of adding Personal Property with a separate deductible--this feature can allow a personal property payment, even if your house isn't substantially damaged.

With Homeowners Choice , you buy dwelling coverage, but may also insure personal property, cover additional living expenses, or both.
Standard Homeowners policy includes dwelling, personal property and additional living expense coverages.
The first $1,500 in Emergency Repairs, as well as the cost to live elsewhere while your residence is being repaired, come with no deductible.








  
Does CEA require policyholders to "pay" a deductible out-of-pocket? 

No. The deductible is the amount deducted from the insured loss—you do not have to pay any portion of your deductible to receive a claim payment. And, two CEA coverages come with zero deductible: the first $1,500 of emergency repairs for homeowners and mobilehome owners, and, if a home can't be occupied after an earthquake, up to $100,000 for Loss of Use expenses. 
  






  
How does CEA's deductible work? 

Policyholders do not have to write a check to the CEA before they get payment on a claim. The deductible is subtracted from the covered damage, and we pay the policyholder the difference. The deductible does not have to be paid up front before we pay a policyholder's claim. Remember, all claim payments are handled through your insurance company's adjuster. 
  






  
Are homeowners eligible for a retrofit discount? 

Yes. In 2016, the CEA began offering a Hazard Reduction Discount, lowering a CEA earthquake insurance premium by up to 20 percent, depending on a variety of factors. You might be eligible to receive a discount if your older house was:

Built before 1979.
Wood-frame construction-type.
Built on a raised foundation.
Frame is bolted to the foundation.
Home has cripple walls, and they are braced with plywood or its equivalent.
Water heater is secured to the building frame.
Homes built on a concrete-slab or combination-type foundation do not qualify.

If a home has...


Cripple walls, they must all be braced with plywood or its equivalent according to California Building Code (CBC) Standards.
Post-and-pier foundation or post-and-beam foundation, the foundation must be modified to CBC Standards.

Note: Homes built on a concrete-slab or combination-type foundation do not qualify.

  
  






  
Are mobilehome owners eligible for a retrofit discount? 

Yes. A CEA policyholder may be eligible for a 23 percent Hazard Reduction Premium Discount, on average, on their mobilehome policy premium if they have one of the following:

Earthquake Resistant Bracing System (ERBS) that will hold a mobilehome in place in its upright position during an earthquake.
Earthquake resistant foundation system: A foundation built on-site that includes supports and piers capable of transferring all weight loads to the ground without failing. Constructed of concrete, metal, treated lumber or wood, or masonry, which are often placed below grade.

In order to qualify for and receive the discount, policyholders who have installed an ERBS or an approved foundation system must provide to their CEA participating insurer a copy of a final inspection report that verifies:

Prior issuance of a building permit, and
That the system and installation meet California Department of Housing and Community Development certification or the local jurisdiction’s building-inspection requirements.








  
What is a cripple wall? 

Generally speaking, a cripple wall is a short wood-framed wall surrounding the crawl space under the house, which needs to be reinforced to help prevent the house from toppling during an earthquake. 
  






  
What is the difference between the 5%, 10%, and 20% Hazard Reduction Discounts? 

A discount is applied for a qualified house based on a number of factors, including the type of verification received, as well as the year the house was constructed:

All qualified houses that are self-verified receive a 5% discount
All qualified houses that are verified by a contractor through the required CEA Earthquake Insurance Dwelling Retrofit form will receive:
	
10% credit if the house was built from 1960 to 1978
20% credit if the house was built before 1960



More information can be found on the Earthquake Retrofit Discounts and Incentives / Hazard Reduction Discounts page 
  






  
On the Hazard Reduction Discount Verification form, does the licensed contractor or structural or civil engineer have to be bonded in order to qualify? 

No, the check box is for information purposes only.

Is earthquake insurance expensive? 

CEA rates are based on a number of factors. While CEA has lowered its statewide average homeowners rates over time by nearly 55 percent, it's important to note that, for example, construction costs in California have increased over 140 percent since 1996. The costs to repair and rebuild after an earthquake will be an expensive burden, but if you don't have earthquake insurance, all the cost to repair any damage will be your cost. Starting in 2016, CEA began offering more coverage and limit choices, more deductible options and more affordable rates—including a 10 percent average statewide rate reduction—to help residents find a policy that best meets their needs and budgets. 
  






  
How does CEA determine the premium amount for its policies? 

CEA premiums are based on science, not profit. Determining factors include the insured value of the home, location, construction year, construction and foundation types, number of stories, and the customer’s coverage choices







  
My premium increased. What can I do to lower the cost of my CEA earthquake coverage? 

There are several ways to lower what you pay for earthquake insurance.

Choose a higher deductible to lower your premium—CEA deductibles range from 5% to 25%, in 5% increments.
If your home is insured under a CEA Homeowners Choice policy, you can reduce your costs by declining personal property or loss of use coverages, or both—you should make that decision carefully, of course, but if you forgo those coverages, you will probably pay less for CEA earthquake insurance.
Make sure your coverage limits make sense for you. Do you rent a 1-bedroom, but have the highest possible personal property limit of $200,000? Make sure your coverage limits accurately reflect what you own.
If you have an older retrofitted house on a raised foundation, you may qualify for a Hazard Reduction Discount of up to 20%, with proper verification. Call your agent or CEA participating insurer for details.








  
Where can I get a premium estimate for a CEA policy? 

Use the Premium Calculator to get a free estimate: 

Select home type (house, mobilehome, condo or rental).
Select location.
Enter current insured value of the house/mobilehome/condo.
Provide basic building construction details if house/mobilehome.

Get side-by-side estimates of different coverage packages.​

You can then email the estimate to yourself or your agent by clicking "Compare and Send" at the bottom of your screen. 
  




Risk and Safety


  
Why do I need earthquake insurance? 

Most homeowners, mobilehome, condo and renters policies don't cover earthquake damage.
And most Californians live within 30 miles of an active fault, capable of producing damaging earthquakes. There are 2,000 known faults crisscrossing California, and on average, according to the official California Multihazard Mitigation Plan:

Moderate earthquakes (magnitude 5.5) strikes California 3 to 4 times a year.
A strong earthquake (magnitude 6 to 6.9) strikes California every 2 to 3 years.
A major earthquake (magnitude 7 to 7.9) strikes California about every 10 years.

Your earthquake risk is real. According to the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF3), within the next 30 years, there is a:

99.7% chance a 6.7M quake or larger will strike California.
46% chance a 7.5M or greater earthquake will strike, likely in Southern California.
68% chance a 7.0M quake will happen in Northern California.








  
What can I do to prepare for an earthquake? 

Consider creating a disaster preparedness plan. For help, check out our Totally Unprepared Checklist, which is available on our Resources page. It is a great tool to help you prepare for the next damaging earthquake. Remember, as part of your plan, you want to be financially prepared, too.

How can I find out if my home is at risk for earthquake damage? 


Most Californian’s live within 30 miles of an active fault, so chances are, you are located within a potential “damage zone.” Significant earthquakes can damage homes from many miles away.
Many homeowners have a false sense of security because “their home wasn’t damaged in the last major earthquake.” It is highly unlikely that the exact same earthquake will recur. Things like the home’s proximity to the epicenter, depth of the epicenter and soil conditions are all factors that can affect the shaking intensity. 
For more information on how to determine risk, visit these sites: Your Earthquake Risk and Preparedness and http://myhazards.caloes.ca.gov.








  
My house has been retrofitted. Do I still need coverage? 

Yes. Retrofitting your house helps reduce your risk of earthquake damage, but does not eliminate it. Earthquake insurance is designed to help you repair or rebuild your home and replace your personal belongings. It also covers extra living expenses if you must leave your home and temporarily live elsewhere else after an earthquake. Some older, retrofitted houses can receive up to a 20 percent Hazard Reduction Discount on earthquake insurance if properly verified. Call your agent or CEA participating insurer for details. 
  






  
My home isn't on a fault. Why would I need earthquake insurance? 

Most Californians live within 30 miles of an active fault. From even a moderate earthquake, substantial damage may occur miles from the fault or the earthquake epicenter. As recent earthquake history has shown, an earthquake can strike anywhere, at any time, even on previously unknown faults. 
  






  
Will government grants pay to repair earthquake damage to my house? 

Government assistance is not always available. You must first qualify, and grants are often limited to urgent health and safety needs. And government loans for rebuilding may be limited and, like your mortgage, must be repaid. In other words, government assistance is designed to help you get back into your home, not to offer enough funds for you to rebuild or fully replace your damaged or destroyed property.

CEA Information


  
Why CEA earthquake insurance? 

CEA has reduced homeowners rates since 1996 by nearly 55 percent, making earthquake insurance more affordable than ever!
As a not-for-profit, CEA rates are based on science and straightforward, objective risk factors. Determining factors are the insured value, location, construction- and foundation-types, age, number of stories and coverage choices.
 







  
Is CEA a state agency? 

No. CEA is a public instrumentality of the state. An instrumentality is an organization created by state law and operated for public purposes. Learn more about CEA’s creation after the Northridge earthquake and history.

CEA is financed solely through insurer contributions, policyholder premiums, and its own investment returns. We are a not-for-profit and receive no funding from the State of California, whether for operations or claim liabilities, and are not a part of the state budget. 
  






  
Who handles CEA applications, renewals and claims? 

Participating insurance companies and their agents process all policy applications, renewals, payments and claims. 
  






  
Who do I contact if I have questions or an earthquake damage claim? 

Participating insurance companies process all policy applications, renewals, payments and claims. CEA policyholders should contact your insurance company’s customer service or claim department regarding policy renewals, changes to an existing policy or the handling of claims. Customers make payment of CEA premiums to your insurance company, not to the CEA. 
  






  
Why doesn't CEA accept credit card payments or ACH withdrawals? 

Each CEA participating insurance company handles billing for their CEA customers, including establishing the number of installment payments and methods of payment. Customers can pay their bills using whatever payment method their participating insurance company offers. 
  






  
If I have to move out of my property due to damages caused by an earthquake, how does CEA handle this? 


If you purchased Loss of Use coverage, you are eligible for the additional living expenses necessary to maintain your normal standard of living, up to the coverage limit you selected.
If selected, Loss of Use coverage is offered in limits of $1,500, $10,000, $15,000, $25,000, $50,000, $75,000 and $100,000.
If you have a CEA Renters policy, rest easy. CEA will pay for your additional living expense, according to the policy terms, limits, and conditions, if you need to move out while your landlord makes repairs, or while you look for a new residence to move into. 
If you are a landlord and you have a CEA policy on the rental property, CEA will pay, in accordance with policy terms, limits, and conditions, the fair rental value for your rental property under the Loss of Use coverage. 








  
Can loss of use be used even if the damages do not exceed the deductible?  

Yes. Two CEA coverages come with zero deductible: the first $1,500 of emergency repairs for homeowners and mobilehome owners, and, if a home can't be occupied after an earthquake, additional living expenses up to the Loss of Use coverage you selected.  
  






  
Does CEA offer coverage for items like crystal, china and porcelain? 

You can add "breakables" coverage as an option on your policy (subject to sublimit), to cover breakable belongings such as dishes and ceramics.





CEA Financial Strength


  
Will CEA be able to pay all of its claims if there is an earthquake? 

CEA has a claim-paying capacity of more than $15 billion. Also:

CEA is financially sound, with an A- (Excellent) rating from A.M. Best Co., the world's leading rating agency of insurance companies.
CEA is privately funded. We don't receive any money from the state, so state budgets or budget deficits have no impact on our ability to pay claims.
CEA could cover all its claims if the 1906 San Francisco, 1989 Loma Prieta, or 1994 Northridge earthquake reoccurred today.
	 








  
How much claim-paying capacity does CEA have? 

CEA has more than $15 billion in claims paying capacity and has maintained an A- (Excellent) rating with A.M Best. CEA could cover all its claims if the 1906 San Francisco, 1989 Loma Prieta, or 1994 Northridge earthquake reoccurred today.

Homeowners and Mobilehome Owners


  
How much does a CEA homeowners earthquake insurance policy cost? 

The minimum annual premium for a CEA standard Homeowners or Homeowners Choice policy is $100. Various rating factors determine your premium, such as:

Degree of earthquake risk where you live
Insured value of the house
The house's number of stories, age, and foundation and construction type
The policy coverages, limits and deductibles you choose
Whether or not the insured dwelling has been seismically retrofitted, per defined building code standards, and qualifies for the Hazard Reduction Discount

How much does a CEA mobilehome policy cost? 

The minimum annual premium for CEA standard Homeowners or Homeowners Choice policies is $45. Different factors determine your premium, such as:

Earthquake risk where you live.
Insured value of your mobilehome.
The policy coverages, limits and deductibles you choose.
If your mobile has an earthquake resistant bracing system or foundation system installed.

Find a Mobilehome policy that works with your budget and coverage needs. And use our Premium Calculator to get a policy estimate.







  
What's the difference between Homeowners and Homeowners Choice policies?

Compare Homeowners Choice and standard Homeowners Policies








  
Is retrofitting required before purchasing a CEA policy?  

It is not required to have the a home retrofitted in order to purchase a CEA policy however, CEA encourages all California homeowners to reduce their risk of earthquake loss. Visit the page Your Earthquake Risk and Preparedness to learn more about preparedness.

How much does a CEA condo unit policy cost?

The earthquake risk where you live.
The market value of the insured condo.
The policy coverages and deductibles you choose.

Find the coverages, limits and deductibles that work with your budget and needs. And use our Premium Calculator to get a policy estimate.







  
Does CEA offer a master earthquake policy for homeowner associations? 

No, but the CEA does offer individual condominium-unit homeowner earthquake insurance. 
  






  
If my HOA doesn't have an earthquake master policy, do I need Loss Assessment coverage? 

Your homeowners association may have insurance for common areas and the exterior and the structure of the building. But the master earthquake policy doesn't cover the inside of your unit or compensate you for loss of use. Your association may also require condo unit owners to share repair costs or pay part of the association's policy deductible through a loss assessment. To learn more about our condo unit policies, download a copy of the condo unit owners brochure. 
  






  
I own my condo unit. Are there coverage options for me? 

Condo unit owners have unique needs. Condo association master earthquake policies usually don't cover damage to your personal belongings or damage to the inside of your home. And while some associations may cover earthquake damage to a condo building's exterior or common areas,  many also require unit owners to pay a portion of the repair costs or the association's policy deductible (by levying a loss assessment). CEA offers a condo unit policy with coverage for your belongings and the interior of your condo unit, as well as loss assessment coverage. 
  






  
What is the highest limit offered for the building property for an individual condo unit owner?  

If selected, the limit on building property for an individual unit owner is $100,000. This will cover items permanently attached such as built in appliances, fixtures, and flooring. For all terms and conditions please read the CEA condominium policy. 
  






  
Is there loss assessment coverage on a CEA condo unit policy? 

Yes. Loss Assessment coverage has options up to $100,000 for an individual unit owner to help cover the cost of special assessments their Home Owners Association (HOA) may assess for the cost of repairing the unit structures, or may be used towards the HOA’s master policy deductible. For all terms and conditions please read the CEA condominium policy.  
  
  




Renters


  
How much does a CEA renters policy c​ost? 

The minimum annual premium for CEA Renters Policy is $35. Different factors determine your premium, such as:

Earthquake risk where you live.
The policy coverages, limits and deductibles you choose.

Find a Renters policy that works with your budget and coverage needs. And use our Premium Calculator to get a policy estimate.







  
I rent, so will my landlord's policy cover my belongings? 

No. If you rent, you need a separate renters policy to cover your personal belongings. CEA renters earthquake insurance insures personal property such as TVs and furniture, with deductibles ranging from 5 to 25 percent, and covers additional living expenses—if you must live and eat elsewhere following a quake—of up to $100,000 with no deductible. 
  




Deductibles and Discounts


  
What are my deductible options? 

Policyholders can choose deductibles of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% or 25% on all coverages that carry a deductible.
For Homeowners, you have two choices of policies: Homeowners Choice or standard Homeowners . With Homeowners Choice, you have the option of adding Personal Property with a separate deductible--this feature can allow a personal property payment, even if your house isn't substantially damaged.

With Homeowners Choice , you buy dwelling coverage, but may also insure personal property, cover additional living expenses, or both.
Standard Homeowners policy includes dwelling, personal property and additional living expense coverages.
The first $1,500 in Emergency Repairs, as well as the cost to live elsewhere while your residence is being repaired, come with no deductible.








  
Does CEA require policyholders to "pay" a deductible out-of-pocket? 

No. The deductible is the amount deducted from the insured loss—you do not have to pay any portion of your deductible to receive a claim payment. And, two CEA coverages come with zero deductible: the first $1,500 of emergency repairs for homeowners and mobilehome owners, and, if a home can't be occupied after an earthquake, up to $100,000 for Loss of Use expenses. 
  






  
How does CEA's deductible work? 

Policyholders do not have to write a check to the CEA before they get payment on a claim. The deductible is subtracted from the covered damage, and we pay the policyholder the difference. The deductible does not have to be paid up front before we pay a policyholder's claim. Remember, all claim payments are handled through your insurance company's adjuster. 
  






  
Are homeowners eligible for a retrofit discount? 

Yes. In 2016, the CEA began offering a Hazard Reduction Discount, lowering a CEA earthquake insurance premium by up to 20 percent, depending on a variety of factors. You might be eligible to receive a discount if your older house was:

Built before 1979.
Wood-frame construction-type.
Built on a raised foundation.
Frame is bolted to the foundation.
Home has cripple walls, and they are braced with plywood or its equivalent.
Water heater is secured to the building frame.
Homes built on a concrete-slab or combination-type foundation do not qualify.

If a home has...


Cripple walls, they must all be braced with plywood or its equivalent according to California Building Code (CBC) Standards.
Post-and-pier foundation or post-and-beam foundation, the foundation must be modified to CBC Standards.

Note: Homes built on a concrete-slab or combination-type foundation do not qualify.

  
  






  
Are mobilehome owners eligible for a retrofit discount? 

Yes. A CEA policyholder may be eligible for a 23 percent Hazard Reduction Premium Discount, on average, on their mobilehome policy premium if they have one of the following:

Earthquake Resistant Bracing System (ERBS) that will hold a mobilehome in place in its upright position during an earthquake.
Earthquake resistant foundation system: A foundation built on-site that includes supports and piers capable of transferring all weight loads to the ground without failing. Constructed of concrete, metal, treated lumber or wood, or masonry, which are often placed below grade.

In order to qualify for and receive the discount, policyholders who have installed an ERBS or an approved foundation system must provide to their CEA participating insurer a copy of a final inspection report that verifies:

Prior issuance of a building permit, and
That the system and installation meet California Department of Housing and Community Development certification or the local jurisdiction’s building-inspection requirements.








  
What is a cripple wall? 

Generally speaking, a cripple wall is a short wood-framed wall surrounding the crawl space under the house, which needs to be reinforced to help prevent the house from toppling during an earthquake. 
  






  
What is the difference between the 5%, 10%, and 20% Hazard Reduction Discounts? 

A discount is applied for a qualified house based on a number of factors, including the type of verification received, as well as the year the house was constructed:

All qualified houses that are self-verified receive a 5% discount
All qualified houses that are verified by a contractor through the required CEA Earthquake Insurance Dwelling Retrofit form will receive:
	
10% credit if the house was built from 1960 to 1978
20% credit if the house was built before 1960



More information can be found on the Earthquake Retrofit Discounts and Incentives / Hazard Reduction Discounts page 
  






  
On the Hazard Reduction Discount Verification form, does the licensed contractor or structural or civil engineer have to be bonded in order to qualify? 

No, the check box is for information purposes only.

Is earthquake insurance expensive? 

CEA rates are based on a number of factors. While CEA has lowered its statewide average homeowners rates over time by nearly 55 percent, it's important to note that, for example, construction costs in California have increased over 140 percent since 1996. The costs to repair and rebuild after an earthquake will be an expensive burden, but if you don't have earthquake insurance, all the cost to repair any damage will be your cost. Starting in 2016, CEA began offering more coverage and limit choices, more deductible options and more affordable rates—including a 10 percent average statewide rate reduction—to help residents find a policy that best meets their needs and budgets. 
  






  
How does CEA determine the premium amount for its policies? 

CEA premiums are based on science, not profit. Determining factors include the insured value of the home, location, construction year, construction and foundation types, number of stories, and the customer’s coverage choices







  
My premium increased. What can I do to lower the cost of my CEA earthquake coverage? 

There are several ways to lower what you pay for earthquake insurance.

Choose a higher deductible to lower your premium—CEA deductibles range from 5% to 25%, in 5% increments.
If your home is insured under a CEA Homeowners Choice policy, you can reduce your costs by declining personal property or loss of use coverages, or both—you should make that decision carefully, of course, but if you forgo those coverages, you will probably pay less for CEA earthquake insurance.
Make sure your coverage limits make sense for you. Do you rent a 1-bedroom, but have the highest possible personal property limit of $200,000? Make sure your coverage limits accurately reflect what you own.
If you have an older retrofitted house on a raised foundation, you may qualify for a Hazard Reduction Discount of up to 20%, with proper verification. Call your agent or CEA participating insurer for details.

Risk and Safety


  
Why do I need earthquake insurance? 

Most homeowners, mobilehome, condo and renters policies don't cover earthquake damage.
And most Californians live within 30 miles of an active fault, capable of producing damaging earthquakes. There are 2,000 known faults crisscrossing California, and on average, according to the official California Multihazard Mitigation Plan:

Moderate earthquakes (magnitude 5.5) strikes California 3 to 4 times a year.
A strong earthquake (magnitude 6 to 6.9) strikes California every 2 to 3 years.
A major earthquake (magnitude 7 to 7.9) strikes California about every 10 years.

Your earthquake risk is real. According to the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF3), within the next 30 years, there is a:

99.7% chance a 6.7M quake or larger will strike California.
46% chance a 7.5M or greater earthquake will strike, likely in Southern California.
68% chance a 7.0M quake will happen in Northern California.








  
What can I do to prepare for an earthquake? 

Consider creating a disaster preparedness plan. For help, check out our Totally Unprepared Checklist, which is available on our Resources page. It is a great tool to help you prepare for the next damaging earthquake. Remember, as part of your plan, you want to be financially prepared, too. Purchase CEA earthquake insurance to help repair, replace, rebuild, and recover!
