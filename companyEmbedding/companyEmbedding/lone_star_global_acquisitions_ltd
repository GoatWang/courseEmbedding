Investment Approach


                    Lone Star seeks investment opportunities in developed markets that have suffered an economic and/or banking crisis, resulting in a dislocation in asset pricing and value opportunities.  Specifically, Lone Star seeks to capitalize on market conditions in which:
			
                

Liquidity is restricted and financing is constrained;
Financial institutions’ balance sheets are under pressure and there is a need to dispose of high volumes of assets to manage capital, deleverage and build liquidity; and
Lone Star is able to achieve a favorable position in a transaction through its large network of relationships across the globe.


                    When pursuing investment opportunities, Lone Star evaluates a broad scope of transactions including, but not limited to:
			
                

Equity and debt investments in value-oriented assets, including corporate, commercial, and single family residential real estate and consumer debt;
Other real estate and real estate-related assets;
Control investments in financially oriented and other operating companies; and
Securitized products such as RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities), CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations, the underlying assets of which generally consist of RMBS), CMBS (Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities) and other asset-backed securities.


                    Lone Star’s investment approach focuses on leveraging long standing relationships with counterparties to source opportunities, a comprehensive bottom-up asset-based underwriting approach, a streamlined approval process, a dedicated asset management platform and the continual evaluation of exit strategies.

History 


                    Lone Star was founded by John Grayken in 1995.  Since the establishment of the first Fund in 1995, Lone Star has organized seventeen funds with aggregate capital commitments totaling over $70 billion.
			
                

                    Lone Star’s origins trace back to a joint venture between a third party investment group and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1993, called Brazos Partners, L.P. (“Brazos Partners”), in which nearly 1,300 “bad bank” assets that were impaired as a result of the U.S. savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s were acquired and resolved.  As Chairman and CEO of the general partner of Brazos Partners, Mr. Grayken led the operation.  After the majority of the assets held by Brazos Partners had been liquidated, Mr. Grayken began organizing institutional capital to continue pursuing investment opportunities on a larger scale.  Brazos Fund, L.P. (“Brazos Fund”) closed in 1995 with approximately $250 million of capital commitments and subsequently targeted investments primarily in debt and real estate in North America.  Brazos Advisors, LLC was established in 1995 to carry out the day-to-day management and servicing of the assets acquired by Brazos Fund.  Mr. Grayken next organized Lone Star Opportunity Fund, L.P. (“Lone Star Opportunity Fund”), which closed in November 1996 with $396 million of capital commitments.  Brazos Advisors, LLC, which was subsequently renamed Hudson Advisors L.P., provided asset management and other support services to Lone Star Opportunity Fund.
			
                

                    During 1995 and 1996, certain of the Funds began actively investing in Canada, establishing themselves as large acquirers of debt in Canada.  Based on the success of the migration outside of U.S. markets, the strategic decision was made by Mr. Grayken to implement a global platform in 1997.  Since that time, the Funds have invested broadly across the U.S., Western Europe and East Asia.  From 1998 to 2004, the Funds invested primarily in East Asia (Japan, Korea, Indonesia and Taiwan), following the collapse of the real estate bubble in Japan in the early 1990s and the broader financial crisis in East Asia in the late 1990s.  In 2005, investment activity in Europe began to intensify after the introduction of the Eurozone, resulting in the consolidation and deleveraging of financial institutions.  In 2007, Lone Star began to see significant investment opportunities re-surfacing in the U.S. as capital flows slowed dramatically and illiquidity became widespread.
			
                

                    Since its inception in 1995, Hudson Advisors L.P. and its global subsidiaries (collectively, “Hudson”) have been dedicated to the support of the Funds’ investment activities globally, providing due diligence and analysis, asset management and other support services.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.
