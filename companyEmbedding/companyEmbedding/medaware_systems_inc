About Us
MedAware Systems, Inc. disrupts the health informatics industry by forever changing the way physicians, Pharma/Medical Device companies, payers and patients derive actionable inforamtion from published clinical trials research.
The Company is committed to improving healthcare throughout the world by providing access to, and analysis of clinical trials research information. Based on the life’s work of Dr. Zung Vu Tran, one of the world’s leading bio-statisticians and a recognized expert in medical meta-analysis, the company continuously aggregates, organizes, and standardizes medical research data to provide the industry-standard resource for evidence-based treatment decisions.
Human clinical trials are the basis of evidence-based medical science and treatment. The results of these studies are published in peer reviewed scientific and medical journals.  Over 100,000 such studies are published each year; the cumulative number is in the millions.  Until now looking for usable evidence from this huge body of research is initiated by keyword searches in databases such as NIH PubMed, PubMed Canada, Europe PMC, the WHO, journal publishers, and others. Typically, such keyword searches return thousands of hits, making it impossible for a physician or researcher to get a comprehensive understanding of the most recent findings, treatment modalities, or drug and device efficacy without spending months or years reading and analyzing studies.
For Pharma and Medical Device Companies
MedAware Systems’ proprietary, patent-pending software, processes, and methodologies totally disrupt current practices in literature search and meta-analysis. Utilizing our patent-pending software tools, processes, data analytics, and highly trained and experienced staff we:

search and categorize the vast body of published clinical trials related to your specific products
ingest a massive amount of data from those trials in a remarkably accelerated time frame
and provide the most complete and granular meta-analysis possible today

The value you receive is  considerable. Our systematic approach takes far less time and ingests and analyzes far more data points than other approaches in the field. With a comprehensive meta-analysis from MedAware Systems, you obtain far greater insight into the efficacy and safety of your products than is currently available. You also are able to identify reliable trends in patient outcomes and process additional data to uncover trends for specific cohorts and application settings.
This comprehensive and granular level of meta-analysis is critical for company or product acquisition due diligence; for providing evidence to satisfy regulatory requirements such as the new MDR regulations for medical devices in the EU; for creating powerful marketing messages vis-á-vis your competitors; and for understanding all available published research prior to committing to new development. Click here to learn more.
For Clinicians
The Company has created a database that places every patient parameter and treatment variable into a separate database field and links this database to a user friendly front end. Using our Scientific-Data-as-a-Service™, users can quickly input a patient’s demographic profile, symptoms and disease parameters and instantly access the findings of every published study relating to the patient’s condition.  Most importantly, these findings are organized and presented in a way that physicians can easily determine the best evidence-based treatment plan in minutes.
Our Science of Health Informatics SOHInfo is a cloud based subscription service that provides a first in two key healthcare areas. It is the first to aggregate, organize, and standardize data from all human clinical trials across various disease/condition areas. It is also the first to provide the ability to precisely filter this vast amount of research data to deliver treatment information based on an individual patient profile, i.e., age, sex, race, severity of the condition, co-morbidities, etc.
This new decision support tool is competitively priced and initially targeted for millions of healthcare professionals in North America and Europe.
SOHInfo will be an important resource in providing treatment efficacy information to help educate patients. It is quite common for patients to get dubious information on treatments through various sources, TV, the internet, magazines, friends, etc. With SOHInfo, the clinician, in less than a minute, will be able to obtain and share all of the available scientific evidence on how effective that treatment might be for that individual patient.
The Company is positioned to be the first and dominant player in this new field of evidence-based treatment efficacy and safety information.
How we help you lower costs
Historically, the most current and valid information on effective, evidence-based treatments typically takes ten years or more to bubble up into standards of medical practice. The cost of this in terms of patient outcome and dollars wasted is staggering – in the US over $500 Billion per year. This is true for the EU and many other countries around the world as well; all of whom are seeking to stem these unsustainable costs.
With the rapidly accelerating transition to value-based healthcare in the US and around the world, there is now significant incentive for physicians and medical organizations to both increase efficiency and improve patient outcome. Both of these goals are squarely addressed through SOHInfo.
SOHInfo provides a powerful and simple user interface and a set of analysis tools for conducting review and analysis of medical research literature, customized by the user, for far deeper understanding of disease processes, treatments, and outcomes in patient care. The Company has assembled a highly talented and experienced management team to execute this remarkable vision.

When it comes to medicine, mistakes can be dangerous and costly. In the US alone, each year:












1.5M
preventable medication errors result in injury or death 


















$21B
in wasteful health-care spending 

















2%
of prescription errors are potentially lethal 

















up to
&5.6M
wasteful cost per hospital 








Learn more










These prescription errors should not have happened…

Chemotherapy prescribed to a 28-year-old healthy male
Viagra prescribed to a boy under 5 years of age
Insulin prescribed to a patient without diabetes



... Yet they did!

Unfortunately, such inadvertent mistakes happen repeatedly, sometimes causing harm and even premature death. In the US alone, MedAware’s solution could save more than $13 billion of direct annual costs associated with prescription errors. 

Learn more






No bigger data than data that saves lives
MedAware’s patent-pending technology uses big data analytics and machine learning algorithms to analyze large scale data of electronic medical records, and learn automatically how physicians treat patients in real life scenarios. Prescriptions largely deviating from standard treatment patterns are flagged as potential errors with high specificity and low “alert fatigue”.


Learn more







Why MedAware?
With MedAware, healthcare providers, payers and pharmacy chains can leverage on their big data to identify and eliminate a wide range of prescription errors and provide better risk management. This will accomplish the following:

Save many lives
Reduce cost of unnecessary hospital readmissions and excessive length of stays
Improve patient safety and satisfaction
Improve overall healthcare efficiency and quality

“Our disposal costs have dropped which at least covers the cost of the compactors. Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”
Doug GehrigMcDonalds

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."
