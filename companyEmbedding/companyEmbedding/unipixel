Diamond Guard is a liquid resin that is suitable for spray, slot die, inkjet, and gravure coating.


Diamond Guard Advantages
Hard coat protection for glass and polymer film and sheets provides chemically strengthened glass-like performance at lower cost.
Depending on the underlying substrate, up to 9H available scratch resistance improves product service life while maintaining product aesthetics.
Diamond Guard resin is available by the barrel to meet immediate supply chain requirements.



Diamond Guard SpecificationsOptically Clear>90.5% Transmission (free-standing film)<0.6% Haze (PET haze – 0.6%)Glass-Like SurfaceRq = 13.9 nmHard Wear-Resistant SurfaceASTM 6HTaber – CS-10 wheel – 500 cycles – 500g – Haze – no changeWyzenbeek – Denim – 1000 cycles – 500g – Haze – no changeBayer – Luminous Transmission – post Bayer – no changeProduct Application OptionsSlot Die Coat, Spray Coat, Inkjet Coat, Curtain Coat, Gravure CoatDemonstrated Surface Hardness Improvement 





Diamond Guard creates a thin coating over the target base material that increases its surface performance up to eight hardness levels. 






Cover Glass ReplacementThe disadvantages of heavy, easily damaged glass in consumer electronic products has highlighted an industry demand for thinner, lighter, more durable, and less expensive alternatives. Unfortunately, typical hard coat resin technologies can’t offer the scratch resistance, clarity, or flexibility to be considered as a replacement for glass in the cover lens assembly.





Until now.Diamond Guard resin offers:Improved product durability and scratch resistance that maintains product appearance and usabilityReduced weight that meets customer demands, reduces shipping costs, and improves ease of use for handheld devicesSupport and protection for emerging flexible display designsGlass-like display performance without sacrificing high definition and optical clarityDiamond Guard is ideal for use as cover glass, case parts, fingerprint sensors, and touch-activated capacitive or membrane switches and has multiple manufacturing options:Diamond Guard coated film laminated to lens assemblyDiamond Guard resin directly coated to lens substrateDiamond Guard coated film laminated to LCD panelDiamond Guard coated films used to build entire cover lens assemblies 

Product Protection & DecorationDiamond Guard coatings extend the service life and preserve the aesthetics of consumer, industrial, medical, and automotive products while allowing new, innovative design elements. Diamond Guard offers improved protection for membrane and capacitive switches as well as molded decorative surfaces including in-mold lamination (IML), white goods, and automotive trim.
Diamond Guard coated films are easily printable on the non-coated side for cover glass border patterns or decorative surface features that are protected by the hard coat and film layers. Die-cut film parts can be directly inserted for in-mold lamination to softer plastic parts, which adds a scratch-resistant and decorative outer shell layer to the molded part.

SummaryUni-Pixel is about to miss its commercial launch target again - the likely "customer" has no plans to use Uni-Pixel's 23-inch AIO touch sensor.No purchase order for the 7-inch tablet sensor, the prime area of focus last year. Dell is out.Significant discrepancies in Uni-Pixel's production yield charts. No real progress towards commercialization by Uni-Pixel and Kodak in the past two years.Little demand for Uni-Pixel's touch sensors. Direct competitors have 10:1 price advantage, says Intel.Diamond Guard - still a commodity product with poor prospects.A sensor with no customer
Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) intends to launch its first product, an all-in-one (AIO) touch sensor with a 23-inch diagonal sometime this quarter (February call transcript and Needham conference presentation, 9:30). This might be a problem, because the end client is apparently unaware that it would be receiving commercial shipments of such a sensor. Uni-Pixel formally engaged an AIO original equipment manufacturer (OEM) as a development customer in August last year (August call transcript). It was identified as Elo Touch Systems at the Liolios conference in September 2014 by Jeff Hawthorne, Uni-Pixel's CEO (personal communication). According to Elo's customer service, the company does not sell nor has any plans to sell a 23-inch AIO device (see current AIO offerings). The closest comparable product offered by Elo is a 22-inch AIO, with a choice of either resistive or surface-acoustic touch rather than Uni-Pixel's projected capacitive (procap) touch sensor. Uni-Pixel was asked to reconfirm that Elo is still the AIO OEM and explain the size discrepancy between the sensor and Elo's offerings, but the company did not respond.
Elo, owned by a private equity firm, is one of the oldest companies in the touch industry and supplies a variety of touch solutions including touchscreen components, touchmonitors, and AIO touchcomputers, using several touch technologies and targeting digital signage, retail, point-of-sale, hospitality, medical/healthcare IT, industrial, and consumer. However, Elo's business has been in gradual decline due to competition in these mostly mature or low-volume markets. Annual revenues are now down to about $370 million from $413 million in 2011, and the company's debt carries a high risk of default.

Elo has declined to comment on specific questions about the nature of the relationship with Uni-Pixel, citing corporate policy and confidentiality. But Elo's familiarity with Uni-Pixel predates August. Elo has been evaluating the technology at least since the beginning of last year, when, according to Uni-Pixel's CEO, Elo received a functional 15-inch sensor prototype from Uni-Pixel. Uni-Pixel had previously claimed in November 2013 that it had received purchase orders from unnamed customers for a 23-inch AIO sensor and a 15-inch touchmonitor for delivery in Q1 last year, but no product sales ever materialized. There is also a YouTube video posted in May last year showing a test performed on the 15-inch Uni-Pixel touch sensor made for Elo.
Not ready to launch
There are a number of clues that Uni-Pixel is not prepared to ship or even accept an order this quarter. For example, Uni-Pixel is no longer a production-stage company. From 2010 until this year Uni-Pixel had used this label in all its SEC filings, but it is now only in a "pre-production stage," according to the latest 10K filing. The filing also outlines a commercialization roadmap that is considerably less aggressive that the guidance on the February call - production of "viable commercial InTouch touch screens" is targeted within 6-12 months (sometime in late 2015) as supposed to 1-4 months (this quarter).
An AIO integration trial that was initially scheduled for January (Needham conference presentation, 29:00) was not finished, even though samples had been delivered to two module integrators vying for Elo's business (February call transcript). The development customer had not yet picked which one of those module integrators would be tasked with assembling the sensor into a module, and no pricing had been set. Uni-Pixel doesn't even have an updated product datasheet - the one shown on Uni-Pixel's website was last modified in December 2013 (see pdf metadata), and still has spelling errors (for example, "link" instead of "ink"), does not mention the new "proprietary blackening coating" (March corporate presentation, slide 10), and has an important specification discrepancy compared to the latest 10K (line width of "6+/- 1μm" compared to "~6-8 μm"). The company is also missing the critical Windows 8/8.1/10 certification for its sensor, despite working on it since 2013 (personal communication).

Uni-Pixel's Analyst Day in December was promoted as a "unique opportunity" to showcase the company's commercialization readiness, but it was only open to select audience and media were excluded. Even though the event was hosted at a Kodak (NYSE:KODK) facility (and the presentation was authored by Kodak, according to the pdf metadata), Kodak's Investor Relations explained that there were no Kodak invitees and Uni-Pixel was managing all event aspects (personal communication). In the past, Uni-Pixel had been very successful with its factory tours and demos in fooling willing attendees into believing that production was imminent - like the Touch Display Research analyst, convinced that mass production would start in July after an in-fab personal tour and survey of operations in April 2013 (personal communication), or the Cowen & Co analysts, believing in imminent Q4 2013 volume production after a tour in August. In contrast, when Atmel (NASDAQ:ATML) organized a tour of its touch sensor facilities in November 2013, media were welcomed and the company was actually producing commercially because tablet devices using its sensors showed up in stores later that month (personal visit of an Office Depot store).
More telling, Kodak, which is contracted to actually produce the sensors, has not confirmed Uni-Pixel's guidance for a commercial launch this quarter. According to the Manufacturing and supply agreement with Uni-Pixel, Kodak is intimately involved in the business planning and project operations, influencing potential order schedules, pricing, costs, etc. But Kodak claims to be working on tablet sensors, not AIO sensors:
We continue work with Uni-Pixel on building the initial production quantities necessary to support lead customer's assessments in the medium and large display tablet markets. (Kodak March call transcript)
Further commenting on the status of the Uni-Pixel project, Jeff Clarke, Kodak's CEO acknowledged "remaining technical hurdles which have continued to date" and did not mention upcoming commercial revenues. At the same time, he hoped for modest revenue this quarter from commercial shipments by the other touch sensor partner, Kingsbury, a direct Uni-Pixel competitor utilizing a silver-halide technology developed by Kodak. Kodak's CEO also noted that he would not "want to bet on startup businesses in [the 2015] guidance," emphasizing that the revenue and EBITDA contribution from touch would be a "very small number" this year. This was a change from the Kodak August call when he expected that revenues from the touch sensors projects would be "in the tens of millions for the year" (actual commercial revenues from both Uni-Pixel and Kingsbury turned out zero last year). Requests submitted to both Kodak and Uni-Pixel for explanation of the apparent difference in expectations about a product launch this quarter have remained unanswered.

Past promises and management departures
Uni-Pixel has a history of committing to commercialization in an upcoming quarter, and predictably failing to achieve it. For example, in the Q&A at the Liolios conference, about three weeks before the start of Q4 last year, Uni-Pixel's CEO was explicitly asked about a possible delay, but he was adamant that the target for initial revenues remained Q4. As expected, Uni-Pixel did not achieve commercialization and made no shipments during the quarter. Previously, Uni-Pixel's Directors and interim co-CEOs, Carl Yankowski and Bernie Marren, had targeted an initial manufacturing ramp by Q2 last year in a January 2014 press release, with the same effect. Numerous failed commercialization targets during the tenure of Reed Killion, the former CEO, have been documented elsewhere.
A number of notable personnel departures from Uni-Pixel and Kodak in recent months also cast doubt about an imminent product launch. Robert Berg, Uni-Pixel's Senior VP of Sales and Marketing for more than a year, left in June last year to re-unite with his former employer - a surprising move if large sales commissions were just around the corner. Uni-Pixel did not announce his departure, even though he had been listed on the company's management webpage. Daniel Van Ostrand, the Founder and Senior VP of Engineering and R&D, left in September last year after 15 years with the company to "pursue other interests," namely working as "a consultant to the printed electronics industry" (Touch Gesture Motion Conference speaker list), with a website proclaiming to be the "future home of something cool." He also sold all his Uni-Pixel stock in December, on the day the company was hosting its Analyst Day. Martin Kykta, Uni-Pixel's Senior Research Scientist - responsible for developing, improving, and measuring the "flexible electronics to be used in touch sensors" - left in August after seven years with the company to be a full-time President of his own one-man electro-optics consultancy (speaker list). Douglas Edwards, Kodak's head of Functional Printing, who had overseen the touch sensor projects since 2013 left in December after reorganization. The business, under a new name, is now managed on an interim basis.

Tablet sensor flop
In May last year, less than a month after his appointment, Uni-Pixel's CEO announced that "based on new roadmap, technical work streams [had] now focused on development project to produce an initial product for the tablet market." He selected a new product, a 7-inch tablet sensor, because Uni-Pixel's technology "most readily" applied to that size (May call transcript). Previously, the company had worked primarily on notebook and larger size sensors. The company also engaged a new development customer and eventually "received touch and optical performance approval" (Analyst Day presentation, slide 15). The customer was supposed to buy this sensor when the product was "fully ready" (May call transcript), but in October the customer decided not to place an order and instructed Uni-Pixel to start working on another tablet design instead, according to Uni-Pixel. Uni-Pixel's CEO blames the market:
At the time we decided to develop the 7-inch, there was a pretty reasonable market for it. What's happened since is that the 7-inch market has really been going into oversupply, so our customer asked us to focus on 10-inch instead of 7-inch (Needham conference presentation, 32:30)
That explanation makes no sense, for three reasons:
First, the May press release insisted that the "other touch-screen market segments" were to be addressed only after "this initial [7-inch] product launch," yet Uni-Pixel rushed to start work on the AIO program in August and then proceeded with the new 10-inch program in October (March corporate presentation, slide 20), without ever shipping the 7-inch product for revenue.
Second, the development customer's decision not to proceed with the 7-inch sensor should not have affected purchase orders by other interested parties. On the May call, Uni-Pixel had argued that there was a wide selection of candidates lined up as potential development customers for such a sensor.
Third, the weakness in tablet shipments did not suddenly occur in September or October - any oversupply condition should have been evident much earlier. The tablet market was already "crashing" in the summer of last year.

Picture 1: Kodak Manager Mike Smith showing off the 7-inch sensor rejected by the customer (NYT video, 3:40)

In May last year, DisplaySearch, a research outfit often quoted by Uni-Pixel, had already warned that for the first time ever tablet shipments registered a year-over-year decline in April. Yet Uni-Pixel maintained that the tablet market was healthy, with "exceptional growth [underscoring] the magnitude of the initial opportunity Uni-Pixel was pursuing" (May call transcript). Even most recently, on the call last February, the CEO was still describing tablets as a "growing market opportunity," despite tablet display shipments experiencing year-over-year declines of 9% and 24% in January and February, according to WitsView (see table labeled "Shipment" and use Wayback Machine for earlier data).
Huge market, but no order
Every major tablet manufacturer, except Apple, sells and actively develops 7-inch tablets today. These small tablets still command the dominant market share, about 50%, of total unit shipments (DisplaySearch press release). The 7-inch segment has always been extremely competitive and 7-inch white-label tablets have been selling for as low as $50 since last summer. If the customer actually made and sold 7-inch tablets, and if Uni-Pixel's sensors had decent performance and price advantages, the customer should have been even more eager to order the sensors, to counteract the drop in tablet selling price and preserve margins. Moreover, the "patient" customer, as it was portrayed on the February call, should have placed the order early on so it can be the first in line to receive shipments and have a cost advantage against the competition once the market balance were eventually restored.

Picture 2: Singulated 7-inch sensor film sheets and packing label (analyst day video, 4:40)
However, Uni-Pixel and its partner appear more interested in development than actual sales. Uni-Pixel continued to tout its progress with the 7-inch sensor throughout last year, but was short on specifics. In August Uni-Pixel announced the delivery of the first "tens of samples" to the tablet development customer (August call transcript) . On the Analyst Day video recorded at Kodak's facilities, the product is shown as tested and packaged for shipment (see from 3:30 till end) - the sensor does not look very transparent (possibly due to sensor line width not within specifications), wastes too much film (each sensor sheet takes about 2 sqft instead of the optimal 0.4 sqft), and the final verification and packaging process appears too labor intensive. On the August call, the CEO initially stated that the sensor samples had already undergone integration and performance evaluation by the customer, providing "valuable integration yield data and positive feedback on sensor performance." But when asked on the call how many had been actually assembled into modules, the CEO contradicted himself by replying that the customer was still "working on assembling all of them into modules," that is, the integration and evaluation had not been fully completed. Uni-Pixel never disclosed the integration yield achieved by the development customer in that first trial.
As of early November, there was still no indication by management that there had been a problem with obtaining a product order the month before and that the initial 7-inch design had been cast aside. While initial revenues had now been postponed to 2015, the work on the initial tablet design was progressing as usual:

We continue to benefit from the strong relationship with our tablet customer, who understands the challenge of our yield ramp, and remains fully engaged. We continually discuss our progress to ensure our testing methods will result in high integration yields, and we are working with this development customer to plan follow-on integration trials and prototype delivery schedules. (November call transcript)
Slide 15 in the November corporate presentation also reiterated that the company was working the final development of this tablet product." The company waited until the Analyst Day in December to reveal for the first time that a new 10-inch tablet design had been initiated in October instead (Analyst Day presentation, slide 17). The practice of sending samples but never obtaining and fulfilling an actual product order is similar to what transpired in January last year, when it became clear that rather than making the expected product deliveries in late 2013, the company had simply "provided hundreds of samples and demonstration units to key potential customers" but no "commercial production orders were shipped" (January 2013 press release).
Dell is out
Uni-Pixel CEO told investors that the company was working on too many product designs ("SKUs") in early 2014, so he picked the small 7-inch tablet sensor to focus the company's development effort (Needham conference presentation, 08:50 and slide 14). But by doing so, Uni-Pixel effectively reneged on its contract with Dell, which at that time called for another tablet sensor.
In February last year, Jeff Tomz, Uni-Pixel's CFO, had signed an amended "Statement of Work" with Dell that stipulated a specific "conditional" purchase order for a larger, 11-inch, tablet sensor:
at least 1,000 Metal Mesh Sensors to be delivered no later than June 30, 2014 for the purpose of evaluation by Dell.
The sensors were for intended for Dell Venue Pro 11, an 11-inch tablet with a detachable keyboard (a "hybrid") codenamed "Midland," or "another applicable platform." Uni-Pixel did not disclose that order last year and did not deliver on it.

According to the text of the Dell agreement, as amended, the relationship terminated in November last year (no further amendments have been filed). Yet Dell is still listed as a "current partner" in the latest 10K (page 10), and investors are misled that Uni-Pixel "will sell significant quantities of InTouch touch sensors through this relationship." The irony is that, unlike Dell, neither the tablet nor the AIO development customer is mentioned or described in the 10K. It is also interesting that Dell inserted an anti-bribery and anti-corruption clause in the February amendment, which raises questions about the circumstances surrounding the original agreement signed in late 2012, specifically why exactly did Uni-Pixel get $5 million with no apparent obligation in return. Uni-Pixel did not respond when asked to comment on the status of the Dell agreement and the failure to disclose the termination.
Uni-Pixel has made no progress under the agreement with its ecosystem partner Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) either. Uni-Pixel got another $5 million two years ago to cover equipment purchases and has not yet recognized it as revenue - it is still a current liability on the balance sheet. That agreement is scheduled to expire March next year, and it is not entirely clear what would happen then, as all interim deadlines were effectively removed by an amendment a year ago.
Yield charts don't match
Uni-Pixel has a problem the production yields it has reported recently. Production yield is an important determinant of the manufacturing cost for touch sensors, and the company's yield data are conflicting. There are three charts showing recent yields measured at the roll-to-roll tester in the manufacturing facility operated by Kodak. Kodak is supposed to maintain the yield database (Manufacturing and supply agreement, sections 5.1 and 6.3), and has been operating the pilot line since the end of August (Needham conference presentation, 23:20). The chart on slide 20 in the Analyst Day presentation has the yields of individual runs for the period August 20, 2014 - November 19, 2014. The chart on slide 21 in the Needham conference presentation applies to the period August 20, 2014 - December 12, 2014. The chart on slide 22 in the March corporate presentation covers only the AIO testing and does not show individual runs but what appears to be either an average yield or just one run, for each day in the span of three weeks, or 14 consecutive workdays, sometime in late February to early March.

The first two charts both contain the period August 20, 2014 - November 19, 2014, but the graphs do not match. While the charts don't shows values on the Y (yield) axis, the highest yield on the second chart is about 85% (Needham conference presentation, 31:20), and the X axis is assumed to cross the Y axis at 0%. Using those values as calibration points, the data from the first two charts have been extracted with a digitizer tool and plotted on Picture 3.
Picture 3: Uni-Pixel's production yield graphs, side by side
The data extraction process has an estimated precision of +/-1%, with the limitation that it cannot identify more than three runs per day and cannot distinguish more than one run for a given yield on the same. Overall, the resulting plot resembles the original lines closely, including the linear fit lines. The "Analyst Day" line simply does not match the "Needham" line in the overlapping period and the discrepancies appear random, ranging from none on days like September 23 to about 37% on September 5. Only about 45% of the identified runs have similar yields .
When confronted about the mismatch between the charts from the two slides, Uni-Pixel's Investor Relations first argued that the data were the same in both charts for the common period. In a follow-up, Uni-Pixel's CEO reiterated that the data were the same and sourced from the same database, saying that had "no idea why [Microsoft PowerPoint] graphed it slightly different," and then refused further explanation. Kodak did not reply to a request for comment on the obvious data discrepancies.
There are two additional issues with these charts that complicate interpretation of the yield data for individual runs and the yield trend over time.

First, reported yields overstate the true ratio of good sensors to total manufactured sensors in the rolls throughout the period. According to Uni-Pixel's CEO, the roll-to-roll testing equipment has been unable to catch some of the defects identified as "microscratching," and the company had "some escapes through [its] integration partners" (Needham conference presentation, 22:40). In other words, the company has been shipping sensors that registered as good but were in fact defective. As of mid March, Uni-Pixel was still working on "final test optimization" (March corporate presentation, slide 20) with a third-party equipment vendor trying to add a new inspection method (Needham conference presentation, 22:40).
Second, there is no information about sensor size, line resolution, and sensor design from the data points, and those all affect the yield. For example, there were at least three different sensor sizes that Uni-Pixel was trying to produce during the period - the 7-inch tablet sensors (until October, presumably), the 10-inch tablet sensors (since October), and the 23-inch AIO sensors (since August), each with different yield behavior. So even if yield appears to have increased in November, there is no way to tell from the chart whether there was an actual improvement or whether Kodak was simply manufacturing more of the higher-yielding sensors. Similarly, making a sensor with 6-micron-wide conductive lines is much more difficult than making a sensor with a 10- or 15-micron-wide lines, and Uni-Pixel had offered a price list for all of these resolutions in the past (Intel agreement, section 5.1). Finally, the sensor design itself affects yield - for example, sensors with redundancies in the sensor mesh might have a higher yield but at the expense of diminished sensor transparency.
Poor production yields
Picture 4 shows monthly summaries calculated using extracted data from both charts - the median and the average yields with standard deviation bars. The number of observations by month were 6, 16, 13, 6 and 12 from the Needham chart, and 6, 15, 12, and 5 from the Analyst Day chart.

Picture 4: Summary yield statistics show little progress
There is no apparent upward trend in yields in Picture 4, contrary to management interpretation. For example, Uni-Pixel stated in early November:
We continue to make progress increasing our average yield as we apply the knowledge gained from and improvements made to the pilot production line. (November press release)
However, the statistics in Picture 4 and the individual data points from Picture 3 show that average yield was actually decreasing in September and October, right until the day before the press release. Confirming the lack of improvement, Daniel Van Ostrand cited manufacturing yield as one of the two challenges of metal mesh sensors in late October, about a month after leaving Uni-Pixel (Touch Gesture Motion Conference presentation, slide 5). The positively sloped linear fit lines in Picture 3 are not appropriate statistical indicators of an improving yield trend. By extending the trend in both directions, the lines inevitably cross 0% and 100%, implying negative yields prior to some point in the past and yields over 100% after some point in the future, yet yield, by definition, is bounded between 0% and 100%.
In early January, the CEO reiterated that the trend was one of "increasing yield" even though yields were "a little choppy" (Needham conference presentation, 23:20). He was also encouraged that "from November through middle of December [Uni-Pixel] started to see more consistent yield capability," that is, reduced yield variability. True, yields suddenly jumped and variability dropped in November, but then in December yields were back down to the September levels and yield variability worsened sharply. The Analyst Day attendees would probably be surprised to learn that the live pilot production runs they observed resulted in yields of 1%,4%, and 63% (or 22%, on average) on that day based on the extracted data.

The CEO's explanation for the yield variability is not credible. According to him, it is due to three factors - microscratching, trial-and-error engineering experiments, and then the "holidays in the latter part of December" (Needham conference presentation, 23:30). But microscratching cannot be the culprit - by Uni-Pixel's own admission, the company's automatic roll-to-roll tester is still unable to detect microscratching defects and properly measure yield, so even if all the sensors in a particular roll were affected by this defect, they would still be all counted as good, and the yield shown on the chart for the test run would be 100% instead of 0%. With respect to trial-end-error being a factor, it is puzzling that Uni-Pixel would run drastic experiments on the pilot production line operated by Kodak, when there were 2 printing presses and at least 4 plating lines in the facility and another facility in Texas was supposed to be dedicated to R&D and process development (November call transcript and Needham conference presentation, 33:30). Finally, the data end in mid December, so there simply aren't any yield observations from the latter part of December, or the "holidays," in the charts.
The poor yields and high yield variability are easier to explain by fundamental flaws in Uni-Pixel's manufacturing process and equipment. The company and Kodak are attempting to reliably deposit microscopic continuous patterns on both sides of a moving flexible substrate using equipment designed to print bottle labels (only 50-micron registration, see Intel agreement, exhibit A). They then aim to reliably metalize those patterns using an inherently unstable chemical process. Mike Smith, a Kodak Operations Manager with Uni-Pixel's project, tries to explain the two-part sensor-making process while holding the rejected 7-inch tablet sensor, apparently oblivious to the irony that the process and its economics may not be fully thought out:
Putting glue on a piece of construction paper and sprinkling sparklies on top is very similar to what goes on here. The glue is our ink. The sparklies in this part of the process is the metal. It's a little bit more high-tech than that, but, fundamentally, that's what goes on. (NYT video, 3:50)

The only other competitor that tried to use a process involving creating a catalytic pattern followed by electroless plating was Atmel, in partnership with CIT (OTCPK:CCEGF) (CAR.UK) (Uni-Pixel has been a CIT licensee in the past). Atmel was ahead of Uni-Pixel by at least two years in both the patterning and metalizing processes, because it switched early on from printing to a finer process, lithography, and always used touchless plating. Atmel started shipping commercial volumes in 2013, achieved little last year, and finally gave up and announced a shutdown of the sensor business in early February. The other two metal mesh competitors that have had some success so far, MNtech (095500:Korea) and O-film (002456:China), do not use a separate metalizing process but rely instead on a simple printing process followed by a brief curing period. Cima Nanotech's self-forming metal mesh has also shown promise.
On the February call, Uni-Pixel's CEO did not present new production yield data but only discussed integration yield instead. The new yield chart in Uni-Pixel's March corporate presentation has been completely redesigned, not an unexpected development given that the two previous yield charts do not show Uni-Pixel and Kodak "making the right progress" or "understanding how to reduce variability and increase the yield" (Needham conference presentation, 24:25). There is no continuity from the previous two charts - the periods do not overlap; the graph has just one point per day instead of individual runs; no actual yield values are given; and the chart covers only the AIO sensor yield. One could speculate that each major interval on the Y axis corresponds to 10%, implying that the average and median yield in the period were about 40%, with estimated standard deviation of about 6%. That would be an improvement from the results in December, but the yield is still below the target of 50% "net yield" (Kodak agreement, section 7.7). If production yields were that much better than last year's, Uni-Pixel would have put values on the Y axis in this new chart. Moreover, measured yields still overstate actual yields, as the microscratching test has not been finalized.

Integration yield just as problematic
Uni-Pixel's story about integration yield is also confusing. Integration, or back-end, yield is the yield experienced by the module integrator while assembling a sensor received from Uni-Pixel into a complete touch module, and is an important determinant of the competitiveness of Uni-Pixel's product.
Uni-Pixel's CEO reported the achievement of "integration yields in the high 80 percentile with [the] tablet development partner." (February press release), but in the Q&A on the call he implied that he meant high-80% integration yields (subsequently confirmed by the March corporate presentation, page 21). The CEO, a former inspection system applications engineer, should have been aware that percentile and percentage have very different meanings. A percentile is defined as a value on a scale of 100 that indicates the percent (%) of a distribution that is equal to or below it. For example, if an integration trial with Uni-Pixel sensors resulted in a yield in the 85 percentile, that means that among all the yield observations recorded by the module integrator from trials in the past, less than 15% were higher than the yield from the trial with Uni-Pixel sensors. Again, as an example, if the integration yields observed in the past have been uniformly distributed between 0% and 80%, a yield of 68% would be in the 85% percentile.
He also claimed on the call that "ITO film yields are generally lower than [the high 80%s]," implying that Uni-Pixel and its development customer should have been "very pleased." That would come as a surprise to the leading module integrators because their yields were already 80-95% by mid 2013 (KDB industry report, page 33). Module making has been a very competitive, cost-driven business since late 2013, with gross margins often close to just 10% even at 95% yield (CS industry report, page 2), meaning selling at about zero gross margin, that is, at cost, when operating at 85% yield.
Also, according to Uni-Pixel's CEO, this was just one "integration trial" and one "sample," which makes no sense because one trial can only be associated with just one integration yield - the ratio of the good modules divided by the total number of modules assembled from the sample of sensors used during the trial. Also, the result could not have been "a consistent 80% over that sample," as he further elaborated, but just one yield data point of 80%, or actually a high 80%, if it were just one trial. On the call he also described the integration trial as "large," with "a large number of sensors," while in January had only mentioned "low volume sampling of InTouch sensors to customers for integration" (Needham conference presentation, slide 26). In March, Kodak's CEO characterized the recent trails as "low volume" but did describe the integration yields as "favorable." (Kodak March call transcript). There has been no word from either CEO about what was the integration yield of the tens of 7-inch tablet sensors shipped in July last year - they were all supposed to be assembled into modules (August call transcript).

No progress in the past two years
When comparing recent production yields with past disclosures, the conclusion is that there has been no measurable progress towards commercialization - yields remains roughly in the same range as in early 2013. Robert Petcavich, Uni-Pixel's Chief Technology Officer (CTO), together with the former CEO, told investors in March 2013 that expected yields would be "85% and continuing to improve" once commercial production were to start within a month or two on the already operational printing/plating lines (Roth conference presentation, 23:21 and WFG investor call, 20:00 ). Those yields match the highest measured yields in November and December (Picture 3), and commercial production is again just about to start, according to management.
Despite repeated reports of progress and breakthroughs in the past year, measured yields did not improve. In early 2013 actual yields were 20%-40% on average and the manufacturing process was unreliable - not much different from the average yield of about 30% and variability of about 30% in the period August - December 2014 (Picture 4). A former Uni-Pixel employee, a confidential witness for the plaintiffs in the class auction lawsuit that Uni-Pixel has agreed to settle, has explained the causes of the low yield. He testified that until his departure in spring 2013, Uni-Pixel was always changing the production process, "sometimes daily or even twice in a single day," because the company "could never get it down pat." Frequent problems included:

a. Machine jams and improper "plating" on the press, requiring manual adjustment;
b. Even when jams and plating problems were corrected, product that looked good was later reported by the client to have a low yield - indeed, yields were only 20-40%;
c. While larger print samples could be reliably made which were uniform and fully conductive, the smaller the pattern size, the more likely it was to be non-uniform and have microscopic breaks;
d. The goal of shrinking the pattern size down to the desired level of thinness because everyone knew that the lines were visible and that a Moire effect was evident in the larger print remained elusive regardless of materials used;
e. Additional testing to catch problems before shipping samples to clients was problematic - as too much testing and handling could cause broken lines and destroy the product; and
f. Management had "overpromised" product on delivery schedules that could not be met and needed to be pushed out. The team tweaked the product to reduce errors as the deadline would approach; once the product finally looked very good, the first production sample would fail. (Case 4:13-cv-01649, 28, page 22)


All the factors that affected manufacturing yield in early 2013 likely remain - for example, improving the sensor optical quality probably still breaks the electrical performance, and speeding up production probably still results in an increased number of defects.
Three pilot announcements
The "achieved technical breakthrough in roll-to-roll plating process," announced as "tremendous progress" in June last year was supposed to bring manufacturing from a "lab-based development" to a new level - a fully-functional roll-to-roll pilot production line. Yet the next step, the start of actual production and transition to commercialization, was not reached and yields did not improve, which indicates that there was little substance behind the advertised advancement. The announcement, scheduled earlier that month after Intel was informed that production had not started, now looks suspiciously like a trick to support the stock price ahead of last August's shareholder meeting and divert investor attention from several developments that month - the departure of Robert Berg, the liquidation of the entire stake by the largest shareholder of the company, Destrier Capital (compare holdings in the proxy with 13F filing), and the failure to deliver the 1,000 sensors to Dell.
A review of history shows that this is not the first time Uni-Pixel has declared a fully-functional roll-to-roll pilot production success. According to past statements by Uni-Pixel's CTO, roll-to-roll pilot production was first achieved more than three years ago, in March 2011, and then again in February 2013.
In March 2011, the CTO gave an update about the just completed roll-to-roll pilot production runs (March 2011 call, 10:00):
We have run pilot production materials at very high rates on a prototype line which has been the R&D proving ground for our large-scale continuous flow manufacturing process... I will be showing ... next week ... the first roll-to-roll UniBoss pilot production films. [UniBoss is simply the "old" brand name of Uni-Pixel's touch sensors, now InTouch]

Actual production and commercial shipments were to follow shortly:
After introducing the UniBoss solution... in May [2010], we have focused on UniBoss development efforts, on continuous improvement of materials, the processes by which we achieve the highly transparent conductive lines and spaces. We expect the next phase of UniBoss prototypes to allow OEMs and their supply chain to qualify the product for one or more commercial opportunities. Concurrently, we are making plans to put in place high speed production equipment... We anticipate the equipment will be installed and up and running by July of this year... We have already begun installing proprietary manufacturing equipment that can support up to a half a million sqft of film production per eight hour shift. [over $100 million in product value at prevailing prices]
Then again, nearly two years later, he described a fully-functional production line, ready to commence production in the coming quarter:
So, now the line is actually running, we're actually running roll-to-roll material off the line now. We do have a recipe for product that we are bringing off the lines as we speak even this afternoon and we don't see any road blocks to meeting or exceeding that 60,000 units per month in April. We're adding couple of pieces of equipment that are expected to be delivered in a couple of weeks that will amplify that production throughput and that we think the one we know today, there is not going to be hiccup or issues with the scale up, at least for 60,000 units. (February 2013 call transcript)
Uni-Pixel managed to make and ship a 50 samples in April that year, but they were not accepted by Dell, and actual production never started.
Touchless, like in 2008
Another recent milestone, touchless plating, is supposed to be a major innovative step towards commercialization, but is in fact an 8-year old idea. The "engineering proof-of-concept" announced on the February call involved "converting parts of the web transport system on one of the plating lines from a mechanical roller system to 'touchless' system," with further work directed towards a complete upgrade to touchless web handling. The non-contact system modification is supposed to bring actual yield closer in line with yield measured at the automatic roll-to-roll tester, particularly for the tablet sensors.

Chemcut, Uni-Pixel's plating equipment vendor, and, Atotech, the plating chemistry vendor, are puzzled by the announcement (personal communication). The InTouch rolls are supposed to be double-sided, and Chemcut's engineers do not currently know of a way to convert their plating line into touchless on both sides (only touchless on one side has been done). An Atotech engineer believes that Uni-Pixel and Kodak did modify one of the lines by simply taking most of the mechanical rollers out, but it is not a complete touchless system. He thinks they are also working on another line to make it truly touchless. His guess is that they are trying a similar configuration to the one used by Cemko, an UK plating equipment vendor, utilizing fluidic pressure to keep the film "up the surface."
Picture 5: Cemko's touchless plating system, year 2008

Atotech has partnered with both Chemcut and Cemko, but the engineer recommend Cemko for a touchless roll-to-roll film system. Cemko's system, picture above, is very compact and was specifically developed for delicate printed electronics applications in collaboration with CIT in 2008. In contrast, Chemcut's systems are designed primarily for plating rugged printed circuit boards (PCBs). Atmel, in partnership with CIT, had been using Cemko's touchless system in volume production of touch sensors for two years until exiting the business in February, so it can't be a coincidence that Uni-Pixel came up with the touchless milestone just three weeks later. A Cemko line would have also prevented defects caused by those bubbles stuck on the film and visible on the Analyst Day video (2:05).
Kodak is of little help
Kodak's technology was expected "to enable Uni-Pixel to scale production to meet accelerating demand" and begin commercial production in 2013 (Kodak April 2013 press release). But the only tangible benefits to Uni-Pixel from Kodak's manufacturing agreement appear to be a facility with environmental permits for the plating operation (see the "harmful liquids" warning, Analyst Day video, 2:01) and Kodak sharing half of the project operating expenses (Kodak agreement, section 7.13). One other unexpected benefit is that Kodak might be authoring Uni-Pixel's investor presentations (see Author pdf metadata in March corporate presentation)

Kodak management seem to know surprisingly little about touch sensors. Kodak's CEO joined the company around the same time Uni-Pixel's CEO did and, like him, also lives across the country. He is on record saying things like:
The touch screen sensor business is very large - I reference a $30 billion annual size to this market - and we are very excited to be in it at production quality, at production levels now. (Kodak November call transcript).
His view is shared by Terry Taber, Kodak's CTO, who in July 2013 expected that the market would grow to over $30 billion in 2-3 years and that demand for Kodak's sensors would be "extremely high" (Democrat & Chromicle, July 2013, first video, 1:39). However, the touch sensor market is nowhere close to $30 billion. Even Uni-Pixel's inflated numbers, sourced from what are back-of-the envelope estimates by DisplaySearch rather than actual transactional data, show the total addressable procap touch sensor market at about $5-6 billion (March corporate presentation, slide 6). The real addressable market is just a small fraction of that value, and while it is still growing in units, it is already flat to declining in dollars due to continuous sensor cost reductions.
Moreover, neither Uni-Pixel nor Kingsbury, Kodak's other partner and direct competitor to Uni-Pixel, have reached production quality or are ready for production. Kingsbury is also targeting this quarter for initial commercial shipments, but the goal used to be Q4 and then last quarter, similar to Uni-Pixel. Kodak's original touch sensor film project based on PEDOT technology, announced in 2011, was expected to result in better performing and cheaper touch sensors but never achieved significant sales.
Kodak's CEO also believes that indium is a rare metal and is an expensive part of the bill of materials of touchscreen devices (WhatTheyThink video, 1:58). But indium is not a rare metal - it is as abundant as cadmium or silver. Its price is currently close to the price of silver, about $550/kg, and the actual indium metal content in a regular ITO touch sensor amounts to a few milligrams, or less than a penny. The cost of manufacturing of touch sensors is primarily determined by the yield and length of the production chain, and partially by the pattern forming technology, not by the initial raw materials used, which Kodak would have known, if it actually had made any touch sensors.

Kodak's CEO is probably not entirely to blame, as the arrangements with Uni-Pixel and Kingsbury and the entire sensor market strategy were conceived and set during the bankruptcy reorganization preceding his tenure. For example, the agreement with Uni-Pixel was likely put together rather hastily - it stipulates on page 5 that "the revenue and profit will be allocated between the Parties according to Section 6 of this Agreement," but section 6 covers only facility utilization while the revenues and profits are addressed in a subsequent section.
If the goal were to gain a significant market share and if Kodak had a good grasp of the market and costs, it makes little economic sense to support three different touch sensor technologies - copper, silver halide, and PEDOT. Kodak should have first tried to pick a cost winner among those and made sure it would be competitive with the sensors already manufactured by the module integrators. Instead, these three technologies compete directly with each other, confusing the potential customers. For example, neither Kodak nor Uni-Pixel have explained why J Touch, which Kodak and Kingsbury announced as a customer early last year, does not work with Uni-Pixel and is not interested in Uni-Pixel's copper-based metal mesh technology, when both Uni-Pixel and Kingsbury are trying to make the same touch sensors. And Kingsbury and Kodak have been unable to explain why J Touch has never mentioned Kingsbury, Kodak, or any silver-halide touch sensors since the initial press release, nor has it ordered any commercial quantities so far, but had stated in that press release that it "offers touch panel solutions utilizing copper-based metal mesh," from 1.6 to 23 inches.
It seems that Kodak now intends to keep the touch sensor projects running as long as possible in order to keep investors excited about the imaginary "growth opportunity" (Kodak March call transcript). Kodak operates in mostly dull, mature, and declining markets, with shrinking revenues and negative operating margins, so it is tempting for management to try to spark a bit of hope (NYT article). But that could also backfire. For example, last August a Kodak account manager uploaded a marketing video touting the company's expertise in functional printing and touch sensors, not realizing that the video showed a defective Uni-Pixel sensor under a microscope (see snapshot below). After an inquiry to Kodak, the video quickly disappeared from his YouTube account without explanation.

Picture 6: Defective sensor in a Kodak video (Kodak U, 5:50) 
Redundant sensors
Uni-Pixel is overstating the potential benefits of its touch sensors. For example, Uni-Pixel claims that its sensors are "suitable for all size applications" (March corporate presentation, slide 10). However, Uni-Pixel's sensors are unsuitable for smartphones, the most important application in the touch market in terms of both units and dollars. The company still uses pictures of phones to illustrate its sensors and their "numerous benefits" (slide 5 and slide 13) and the CEO had touted the "significant market potential of Uni-Pixel's touch sensors for smartphones" (April press release). However, since the Liolios conference, smartphones are no longer included in Uni-Pixel's addressable market (Liolios conference presentation, slides 6 and 7). The CEO admitted in the Q&A:
We don't believe that our product is really applicable to the phone market. Again, we are talking about placing the metal mesh on top of the display. The pixel size on phones is much smaller, so that metal mesh is going to cover up more of the phone pixel and that creates a noise pattern, display degradation. Also the border, the bezel pitch, is much tighter on phones - we can't address that today.
With reference to the addressable market, Uni-Pixel falsely states that the existing touch technology faces unmet customer needs (March corporate presentation, slide 9). While there is no perfect touch technology, the slide itself illustrates that current ITO-based and embedded touch sensors meet all customer needs, at least the needs that matter.
Picture 7: Existing touch technology meets customer needs

For example, to show that ITO does not scale and is not appropriate for larger displays, Uni-Pixel is actually using the picture of a huge 82-inch ITO-based touch-enabled AIO developed by Perceptive Pixel, now part of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and unveiled in 2011. Even a 24-inch sensor is beyond Uni-Pixel's capabilities, according to the footnote on the first page of its datasheet.
Uni-Pixel also claims that existing touch technology is inadequate in terms of touch response speed and accuracy and pen enablement. But the picture in this section is of Dell Venue Pro 8 tablet being used with a stylus. That popular device actually has a regular ITO touch sensor.
To illustrate that current touch sensors are fickle, with poor signal-to-noise ratio, the company attached a chart of a touch event detected by a regular display without any touch sensor in it that actually shows a very high signal-to-noise ratio. The chart comes from a study that demonstrated how touch can be detected with the circuitry already present in a regular non-touch LCD display by doing some signal processing on the faint noise transmitted through the power line. In effect, the study is an endorsement for embedded sensors which also rely on circuitry in the display itself and are rapidly gaining share this year in high-volume applications as they are virtually free.
Finally, Uni-Pixel is using a picture of three simple resistive, not procap, ITO-based modules to argue that the prevailing ITO touch technology is too costly. However, resistive sensors and modules have all but disappeared from high volume applications due to inherent functional drawbacks. They are also no longer the lowest-cost ITO touch sensor option.
There are similar issues with slide 13 supposed to illustrate the specific functional advantages of Uni-Pixel's sensors (Picture 8).
Picture 8: Uni-Pixel sensors are either unsuitable or have no functional advantages

The top two photos on the right show the LG (066570:Korea) G Flex phone and its bendable display - this was the first flexible phone, released commercially in 2013. That is, curved designs and flexible touch sensors are already taken care of with existing technology. Moreover, Uni-Pixel's sensors are unsuitable for smartphones, by the CEO's own admission. The third picture is of a 55-inch touchdisplay with infrared, not procap, module made by Elo and is from a blog post discussing poor usability of multitouch on large displays.
The other functional advantages in the list on the left in Picture 8 are either irrelevant or misleading. It is true that metal mesh and other non-ITO technologies can have lower resistance, but that is no longer an issue with modern touch controllers which enable fast touch response even in large formats. Many ITO sensors for smartphones and tablets are also one-sided, and ITO sensors such as OGS or certain embedded sensors don't require any film. Uni-Pixel's technology has poor optics and inaccurate color rendition, because the mesh partially covers certain pixels, creating color noise and moiré - that is one of the reasons why it is not suitable for smartphones and high-resolution tablets and notebooks.
The prospect of selling below cost
A product with no significant functional advantages is a tough sell in the touch sensor business. In contrast to an active market for some touch modules, the market for touch sensors is virtually non-existent. Very few touch sensors are actually sold and purchased, and most are produced internally by module integrators or display manufacturers, who are also the potential customers. So unless there is some temporary shortage, the sensor selling price needs to be well below the customer's current internal cost of manufacturing to compensate for the sensor making capacity that would become idle. And then the sensor's production cost needs to be even lower to allow for a viable product with a sustainable gross margin. That is why there are no successful pure-play sensor manufacturers today. The companies that have attempted commercial production in the so-called ITO-alternative space have typically been module manufacturers making the new sensors themselves, like O-film or TPK (3673:Taiwan), or could bundle the sensor with some other component, such as a touch controller, like Atmel, or optical film, like MNtech, or could sustain the losses, like Fujifilm (4901:Japan). The current mainstream capacitive touch solutions - various discrete ITO-based glass or film sensors made by module integrators and various embedded sensors (in-cell, on-cell, or hybrid) made by display manufacturers - are good enough and remain cost competitive with the alternatives offered today, such as metal mesh (copper, silver, silver halide), silver nanowires, CNT, PEDOT and graphene.

Despite the planned commercial launch this quarter, Uni-Pixel has been reluctant to discuss specific pricing and costs, but its poor production yields guarantee that the company is not cost competitive. It will have to sell at negative gross margin to generate volume demand for its sensors and "drive touch adoption and improve profitability down the product chain" (March corporate presentation, slide 13).
The last time Uni-Pixel provided extensive details about its internal model for average selling price and costs was on the November 2012 call, in the middle of its price negotiations with Intel and Dell and during the peak of touch module shortages. The company revealed $20-$22/sqft price for its touch sensors at preferred price, a 30% discount vs "street pricing" of $31-$32/sqft. Its cost of manufacturing could be modeled at about $10/sqft, implied by a gross margin "over 50%." That model price and cost structure was similar to Atmel's, and Atmel got out of the touch sensor business mainly due to price pressures, having initially hoped for $100 million annual revenues. In November 2012, the actual cost of manufacturing of some competitors might have been around $50/sqft indeed, and Uni-Pixel was implying that cost of regular touch sensors at the time was as high as $70-$100/sqft, derived from $40-$60 for 10.1-inch module and 30%-50% discount with Uni-Pixel's sensor. By June 2014, sensors costs had collapsed, due to yield improvements and pricing pressures in the touch module market. Uni-Pixel's own sensors were now described only as "competitive" (June call transcript), implying they were modeled at a slightly lower price than the cost of "regular" touch sensors. The company's estimate for those came down to $12-$20/sqft, that is about 1/5th of the original range in late 2012, but still higher than the actual costs at the module integrators or display manufacturers.
Intel does not believe Uni-Pixel has a "market-leading cost structure" (March corporate presentation, slide 12). In late 2014, SID published a review article authored by Intel's Senior Touch Technologist in which he stated that his estimate for metal mesh sensor pricing by the end of 2015 would be around $1/sqft ("$10-12/m2"). Uni-Pixel's CEO stumbled badly when asked to comment about the $1/sqft prospect in the Q&A at the Needham conference presentation (33:55):


Q: Intel is now saying that metal mesh will be $1/sqft by the end of the year. Can you compete with that?
A: I don't know how they arrive at $1/sqft. I mean, we are in discussions ...
Q: Well they are looking at actual manufacturers of metal mesh and those are telling them that metal mesh will be $1/sqft.
A: Yeah, so all the surveys that we have done is that touch sensor films or the touch sensors themselves are about $12-$15/m2, so yeah, it is getting close to about $1/sqft.
Q: Right, but this is patterned... metal mesh, it is not just unpatterned film. What we are taking about is $1/sqft of an actual touch sensor.
A: Yup, of the sensor itself, not the module, correct.
Q: And you think basically that you can compete with that.
A: Definitely.

But in a follow-up, Uni-Pixel's Investor Relations replied that the CEO misspoke and he actually meant $15/sqft not $12-$15/m2. The CEO himself later came up with $18/sqft, or $5.5 price for a 10.1-inch sensor, citing DisplaySearch, a stunning retreat from being definitely competitive with the $1/sqft number. If Uni-Pixel were in close contact with Intel, and did "monitor and feed the relationship" as claimed (June call transcript), Uni-Pixel's CEO should not have been caught by surprise by the view of Intel's touch expert on pricing prospects in the touch sensor business. The stated belief in the latest 10K that Uni-Pixel will "sell significant quantities of InTouch touch sensors through [Intel's] relationship" now sounds preposterous.
It is really too late for Uni-Pixel to attempt commercial sales in the tablet and even small notebook sensor segments, as the cost of discrete procap sensors has dropped and embedded sensors have started gaining share. At about 50% yield, which is Uni-Pixel's current commercialization target (August call transcript), the manufacturing cost will be above $10/sqft, probably even $15/sqft and over, but the actual manufacturing cost of regular procap sensors can be as low as $5/sqft right now. Embedded sensors are proliferating, not just in smartphones but also in larger screen sizes. Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) estimates (page 6) that in-cell sensor technology, for example, can eliminate up to 60% of the touch module cost. Since a regular procap sensor is typically 10%-25% of the overall module cost, depending on configuration (KDB industry report, pages 37-38), an embedded sensor is effectively free. For example, if the sensor cost is simply taken out of a $10 regular "discrete" touch module, the module cost will come down to about $8, but a similar in-cell "module" can be as low as $4. BOE is even offering free touch modules for smartphones, selling touch displays at the same price as that of non-touch displays of identical size and quality.

AIO touch sensors are not free yet, but severe competition has eroded potential profitability even in that small segment. Uni-Pixel is apparently relying on faulty market research when it claims (March corporate presentation, slide 7) that AIO sensors "represent the fastest growing and most profitable segment with $235 million [addressable market] by 2018." While the projected procap unit volumes are likely already overstated, the real problem with the dollar value and the entire chart on the right is the implied sensor "pricing." For example, using segment dollar sizes extracted from the chart with a digitizer tool, and dividing them by the procap sensor units projected by DisplaySearch (November 2014 Touch Panel Market, slide 9), the average AIO procap sensor cost come to about $40 in 2013, $50 ($40/sqft?) in 2014 , and $70 in 2015 and 2016. Those numbers are unrealistic and inflated for three reasons.
First, a $70 AIO sensor cost in 2016 is inconsistent with the $65 number from the module ASP chart for 2016 (March corporate presentation, slide 8), also sourced from DisplaySearch, because it implies that a sensor would be more expensive than a module which contains a sensor, a flexible cable, a controller, cover glass, and adhesives.
Second, the persistent overcapacity in the industry simply does not support increasing sensor costs, and the overcapacity may actually be worsening. Touch notebooks, not just tablets, are weakening. Compal (2324:Taiwan), one of the two largest contract manufacturers of notebooks, is predicting (see also this) that traditional touch-enabled notebooks will start disappearing by the end of the year, while the 2-in-1 tablet/notebook hybrids are unlikely to pick up the slack. As embedded sensors have now entered the notebook segment, even more discrete sensor manufacturing capacity could spill into the AIO segment. AUO (NYSE:AUO), for example, expects to start mass production of in-cell touch panels for notebooks in the current quarter.
Third, the AIO procap sensor market is very limited due to ergonomic issues with touch on large vertical surfaces ("gorilla arm") and due to simple aesthetics (distracting fingerprints and smudges). Unit shipments are estimated at 2-3 million in 2014 and 2015 (November 2014 Touch Panel Market, slide 9). Almost all ITO-alternative competitors (over 100) are now targeting this segment and pressuring prices down. The companies with other technologies that still hold a significant share in the AIO segment, such as optical and infrared, are also trying to defend their turf.

A coat that is hard to sell
In February, Uni-Pixel announced that it had received its "first purchase order for two [55-gallon] barrels of Diamond Guard resin" to be used in a film coating trial, and had already shipped it (February call transcript). According to Uni-Pixel, the resin shipment generated revenue, but the selling price was not set. As of mid March, commercial shipments were expected to start this quarter (March corporate presentation, slide 29).
The "film manufacturing partner" for Diamond Guard listed in the latest 10K is Carestream, but the following language found in the 2013 10K has been removed:
They will support the manufacturing, warehousing and sales of our protective cover film line of products.
Last year Carestream announced its own "proprietary hardcoat formulation." It is supposed to provide scratch and abrasion resistance targeting essentially all Uni-Pixel's intended markets, such as touchscreens, flat panels, membrane switches, decorative graphics and white boards (March corporate presentation, slide 24). When Carestream was asked recently to explain how this product is not a direct competitor to Diamond Guard, the company only replied that the product targets "different markets entirely" and declined to comment on its relationship with Uni-Pixel. Incidentally, Carestream has also been competing with Uni-Pixel in touch sensors, developing a silver-nanowires solution since 2010.
The "sale" announced in February is not Uni-Pixel's first shipment of Diamond Guard for film applications. In Q2 2012, Uni-Pixel reported that it had
fulfilled a number of purchase orders for Diamond Guard Hard Coat film submitted by major electronic OEMs, ODMs and film converters that are advancing product designs which take advantage of Diamond Guard's unique characteristics.
At the time, Uni-Pixel was marketing hardcoated film, as supposed to just the resin, but, like the recent shipment, those were only "test level runs," as explained on the call. Uni-Pixel recognized about $70,000 in revenues that quarter, but those were no product revenues as no cost of sales was reported.

Earlier, in March 2012, the company had signed an agreement with Carestream for the manufacture and distribution of the coated film and had received the first purchase orders for "test piloting purposes." In July, the company announced "production-level qualification" and capacity of over 100 million sqft/year to support large-scale volume production, corresponding to over $150 million in potential revenues (Roth conference presentation, 3:50). Full-size purchase orders and shipments were expected later that quarter, but they never happened - the excuse offered by the CTO and the former CEO was that a hardcoat was a difficult "technical sale," with customers having complex specifications and integration steps, and that the ramp of Diamond Guard would take time. (November 2012 call, 30:15).
Based on the sparse technical and marketing information about Diamond Guard available publicly, it is an acrylic-based hardcoat resin. That makes it a commodity product, readily available from numerous suppliers. Companies like Sartomer (AKE:France) and Allnex, for example, are happy to supply the components and suggest specific formulations that would best fit the customer requirements. For example, both companies suggest various options with a urethane acrylate base for about $100 a gallon for a transparent UV-curable acrylic hardcoat resin for coating PET film to 6H pencil hardness (personal communication). So the value of Uni-Pixel's Diamond Guard shipment in January should be about $11,000, and if the product is ever sold commercially, it would be at cost or a single-digit gross margin at best.
Many vendors, including companies with marketing prowess and large customer base, have attempted to push cover glass replacements with much better specs than Diamond Guard since at least 2012, but have achieved little commercial success in mainstream applications. For example, an overview of the 2013 Finetech Japan expo (slide 9) lists products from four different exhibitors, including cover sheets with 9H hardness by Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd. (7912:Japan) (press release) and Nippon Steel Sumitomo Metals Chemistry (datasheet), both announced in 2012. Separately, MNtech has had its 4H TAF in the window of the S View novelty cover case for certain Samsung (005930:Korea) phones since 2013, but it is a low-volume application.

Uni-Pixel's own documents show why there is little demand for Diamond Guard, even if sold at cost. For example, Picture 9 annotates the slide that supposedly illustrates three types of applications for the resin (March corporate presentation, slide 24):
Picture 9: Diamond Guard is unnecessary
However, metadata in the pictures reveals that the broken glass of the iPhone 4 shown there was actually replaced by glass (the picture comes from ads for glass replacement services). Glass was used because hardcoated plastic simply cannot provide enough strength and support to protect the display of a mobile device, and is too easily scratched by a pen, coins, keys, sand, and even glass. Apple would have switched to a plastic screen for the iPhone 5 released in late 2012, if Diamond Guard or similar hardcoats were any good compared to glass.
The picture that supposedly illustrates protective films and case parts was taken in 2012 - again, demand must be low since there have been no commercial sales of Diamond Guard in the past three years.
The last picture is of an AkzoNobel (AKZA:Netherlands) product, a polyvinylidene difluoride cast film, aimed at replacing mechanically brushed decorative metals, and has nothing to do with the acrylic Diamond Guard.
Similarly, the picture on the next slide, slide 25, is of a Samsung Galaxy phone taken in 2011, and Samsung still uses glass for all of its mobile devices. None of the arguments listed on the slide about the benefits of Diamond Guard and the "need for elimination of glass in cover lens assembly" are valid. Corning (NYSE:GLW)'s Gorilla Glass and similar products offered by other glass companies are very difficult to shatter, are inexpensive, can be very thin and light, protect the display extremely well, and are actually scratch resistant, unlike plastic surfaces coated with Diamond Guard.

Slide 26 is also misleading. For example, it states that the minimum effective thickness for glass is 0.5mm as compared to 0.12mm for Diamond Guard film. That is simply not true. Willow Glass, Corning's flexible but tough glass, is available in 0.1mm thickness. Schott's ultra-thin glass can be as thin as 0.025mm.
The cash runs out in 2016
"We're definitely on the right track," Uni-Pixel's CEO told investors, just ahead of the upcoming shareholder meeting in August last year. He meant production revenues in 2014, but that marker was not reached. It has been the same track that leads to persistent cash drain of about $3 million a quarter and repeated commercialization delays. The company is about to miss its product launch target again, has failed to receive an order for last year's tablet sensor, and has a hard time measuring and improving yields. Its technology is now redundant due to declining cost and increased performance of regular ITO and embedded touch solutions. Even if the company were to start volume shipments eventually, it will have to sell at a loss. As the trend persists, the cash should run out by the end of next year, or even sooner, if management comes up with an excuse to accelerate capital spending, such as building or buying a touchless system. A new equity round may be in the works, despite repeated denials by the company.
Uni-Pixel's story told by management is fiction, but successive CEOs, with the approval of the Board of Directors, have been able to repeat it for years and raise millions because there have been no adverse consequences. The recent class action lawsuit is about to be settled for a fraction of the losses incurred by investors who participated in the 2013 equity financing. The SEC has been investigating since 2013, sending at least three letters to the company recently, and the only tangible outcome so far has been a filing of a 10K/A amendment for 2013, which finally disclosed information that should have been disclosed in 2012 and 2013, but there have been no penalties. Uni-Pixel's Directors must feel pretty relaxed if Carl Yankowski, who said that touch sensors are made of indium titanium oxide and promised commercial revenues to ramp in Q2 last year (February 2013 call), is still eager to go on CNBC and pitch the company as disruptive and innovative. Kodak, the manufacturing partner with declining revenues and ongoing losses, is still playing along and paying half of the operating expenses while running Uni-Pixel's inadequate equipment and half-baked processes just so it can pretend that it is developing breakthrough technologies.

Uni-Pixel's equity investors face a dilemma. The best course of action for the long term should be to liquidate the company immediately and distribute the cash to shareholders, before it is gone. But short term trumps long term - the market cap is about $90 million right now compared to cash level of about $20 million, fueled by promises of imminent commercial launches and vast addressable markets. So the incentive is to wait it out as long as possible, trading around bouts of excitement, short covering, and portfolio rebalancing effects, and hoping to get out before the eventual collapse of the stock price. Such a course of action suits management and the Board perfectly as they will continue to receive salaries and stock, until the cash is gone.

Uni-Pixel: A Very Tempting Speculative Buy Pick - Uni-Pixel, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNXL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Uni-Pixel: A Very Tempting Speculative Buy PickJan.30.17 | About: Uni-Pixel, Inc. (UNXL) George Kesarios Long/short equity, Deep Value, special situations, contrarianSummaryUni-Pixel has been struggling for a very long time to promote its technology without success.Recently however it seems the company might finally be turning around.While the balance sheet is in very bad shape, the company procured $3 million in financing.Also, the company ha signed a MOU with Foxconn, which is a big thumbs up for the company's technology. Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) is a company that has two products. The company's Diamond Guard product provides glass-like performance and optical clarity to consumer and industrial products. The company claims Diamond Guard is an ideal alternative to glass or plastic cover lenses, and improves durability. Diamond Guard can replace expensive film on the backside of touch panels, and can replace cover glass on top of a touch sensor, or can be used in add-on protective shield products for mobile phones and other devices. Uni-Pixel's XTouch sensor film can be used as an alternative to traditional touch sensors, and supports narrow borders, curved surfaces, and edgeless designs. With thinner sensor stacks and improved linearity and reliability, XTouch offers a lower cost solution than legacy technologies. In the past investors had very high hopes for the company's technology and products. The chart below depicts just how high expectations were. 

 UNXL data by YCharts However over the years, the company's technology has failed to appeal to the marketplace. As a result its stock has followed a downward spiral, and anyone ever invested in the stock has lost. While I would not characterize UNXL as a development stage company -- because its products are fully developed -- nevertheless, the company might not be a "going concern" for long. The company currently only has about $5 million in cash on the balance sheet, but at the same time is burning about $3 - $5 million per quarter. And when the company does have any revenue, it's not much, and it's not consistent every quarter. 

 UNXL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts And as with most companies that do not have a steady revenue stream, UNXL has been selling shares to survive for several years. 

 UNXL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts So why might the stock be a buy? On the most recent confernce call, the company offered a glimpse of hope. CEO Jeff Hawthorne said: Since the beginning of 2016 we have been awarded 24 programs. We are now rapidly approaching order fulfillment for a number of the new laptops, tablets and two-in-one devices that were awarded to us in the first half of 2016. As you know, there is typically a 6 month to 9 month period between the program win and initiation of production. Chief Financial Officer Christine Russell enlightened us even more: When a customer notified us of a design win, the customer also provides an estimate of monthly shipments they expect over the anticipated life of their device. Aggregating the shipment estimates for our 2016 design wins represents a range of $21 million to $24 million of future revenue for the company, it should be noted these are estimates provided by our customers who will issue purchase orders on a monthly basis. So from what management is telling us, 2017 will probably be the year that the company gets off the ground. However this is not enough. Even if the company does get $20 million in business -- while it will probably be profitable -- it might not be enough to make me buy a stock at 3X revenue with such a poor balance sheet. However there are two additional pieces of information that were announced recently, that might change the company's predicament, and might warrant buying UNXL shares. Item number one: Uni-Pixel Announces Preferred Equity Financing for $3 Million SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- UniPixel, Inc. (UNXL), a provider of Performance Engineered Films™ to the touchscreen and flexible electronics markets, today announced that it has entered into a financing agreement for $3 million of convertible, redeemable Preferred shares. The fixed conversion price of the Preferred shares is set at $1.50, subject to potential adjustments which primarily do not arise until after 90 days. The financing agreement also includes 2,500,000 warrants priced at $1.50 which will have a single price-only reset feature after six months which will reset the warrant price to 93% of the lowest conversion price during the six-month period but will only reset if the price is below $1.50. All of the Preferred shares must be fully converted or redeemed within twelve months from closing. UniPixel has the right to convert any portion of the Preferred shares to the investor by the issuance of common stock so long as the company's stock price is at least $1.50, or, at any time, to redeem in cash equal to 125% of the financing. After the first 90 days, the investor will be permitted to convert the Preferred shares into shares of common stock at the investor's choice, at a price equal to 93% of the common share value on the day preceding any conversion. Item number two: Uni-Pixel Enters into Memorandum of Understanding with GIS  SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- UniPixel, Inc. (UNXL), a provider of Performance Engineered Films™ to the touchscreen and flexible electronics markets, today announced a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") to enter into a strategic partnership with General Interface Solution, Limited ("GIS"), a Taiwan-based, subsidiary of Foxconn, and a billion-dollar provider of integrated touch display solutions in the mobile phone, Notebook PC, 2-in-1 laptop and tablet markets to global customers including major PC and smart phone brands. Under the memorandum the parties will form a strategic manufacturing project that will initially extend over three years and which may be renewed by mutual agreement. A definitive agreement is expected to be executed in the coming weeks. The parties also contemplate entering into a separate development project for foldable/flexible displays.  (Please note that both press releases came out the same date, Jan. 18) As for the first item, the company has secured $3 million in financing by selling convertible preferred shares, plus the investor has an option for an additional 2.5 million shares via warrants. This means that this investor is willing to take considerable risk. The investor is putting a lot of money at stake for shares of a company that does not have a steady stream of revenue yet. I am assuming the investor is betting the company will have a steady revenue stream in the future, and that's why he is making this investment. I am also assuming that the financing was the result of the second press release on the same day. The second piece of news is more interesting, and probably more important. And the reason is because the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) that was signed, is with a subsidiary of Foxconn (OTC:FXCOF). To the extent that the company secures business from Foxconn, I assume the dollar figure will not be small. Also, chances are it will be a long-term contract, that will procure a steady stream of revenue for the company. Please also note one other thing. The $21-$24 million in business the company described in the conference call, has nothing to do with Foxconn. If it were, it would not be a MOU, but a contract. This means that if and when the company gets any business from Foxconn, in will be in addition to the $21-$24 million figure mentioned. How big is the touch sensor market? According to market research firm Market and Markets, "the capacitive sensor market is estimated to reach $31.79 Billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 5.4% during the forecast period. The capacitive sensor market size, in terms of volume, is estimated to register a shipment of 21.14 Billion units by 2022, at a CAGR of 9.3% during the forecast period." So if the company can grab a small piece of the overall market, it will mean a lot to its stock, considering we are talking about a $60 million market cap company. According to market research firm Technavio, the biggest players in the touch sensor space are 3M (NYSE:MMM), Freescale Semiconductor (NYSE:FSL), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Infineon (OTCQX:IFNNF), ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) and Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN). So the company is going up against some of the biggest players in the technology space. These companies also have considerable more resources than UNXL, so it will not be an easy battle. On the other hand, I'm sure Foxconn has tried and tested every touch sensor technology and product on the market. So the mere fact that they signed any kind of agreement with UNXL, hints that the company's technology is probably as good as the other big players. Investor takeaway After many years, the company finally seems to be on the right track. For the first time ever, the company is on the verge of getting a substantial order flow of business. Also, any procurement of business with Foxconn, will probably change the company dynamics permanently. Also positive is the fact that inventors are willing to put up big money, given the bad financial shape of the balance sheet. This probably means these investors see light at the end of the tunnel, and big profits. On the other hand, it's hard to invest with confidence in UNXL shares. But then again, this is why I consider shares of the company highly speculative. High risk means big profits. The fact is that this in only a $60 million market cap company. Investors who buy shares today are not buying at a stratospheric valuation, as investors did of years ago. Investors buying today are buying below the cost to develop the company's technology. So even if the company does not have a great balance sheet, and almost no revenue, buying at these levels means you would be buying at rock bottom prices. Bottom line Given the multi-billion dollar size of the touch sensor market, the MOU with Foxconn, the fact that for the very first time the company has substantial orders to fulfill in 2017, and the $60 million market cap of the company, makes buying shares of UNXL very tempting.
