ACTIVE




Underwriting and carrying insurance risk demand the same comprehensive understanding of risks and liabilities that underpins Enstar’s success in the legacy portfolio space. It was therefore natural, in 2013, for the Group to extend its operations into the live insurance market. Our active underwriting businesses provide profitable income streams arising from premiums and commissions. They also bring Enstar broad sets of technical skills and expertise. This human capital can be deployed both for underwriting, and to support other Group companies. The powerful capabilities of our live underwriting organisations can be deployed in the acquisition and operation of legacy books with active risk components.
LIVE UNDERWRITING
 



ATRIUM
Atrium Underwriting Group Ltd. was acquired in 2013, in partnership with Stone Point Capital LLC’s Trident V funds. Atrium is a longstanding and highly respected underwriting business at Lloyd’s. It manages Syndicate 609, and provides about a quarter of its underwriting capital, alongside traditional ‘Names’. The acquisition granted Enstar a prominent position in global markets for a very broad range of insurance and reinsurance risks. www.atrium-uw.com

 

 



STARSTONE
In 2014 Enstar and Trident V acquired StarStone Insurance Bermuda Ltd. Launched in 2008 as Torus Insurance, StarStone is a global specialty insurer providing a diversified range of insurance products to customers around the world. The acquisition expanded Enstar’s live underwriting reach through its platforms in Lloyd’s and the London market, Continental Europe, Australia, and the US. Through StarStone, Enstar serves a diverse client base across five key product groups. www.starstone.com

 

 



KAYLARE
Most recently, Enstar extended into the speciality reinsurance market through its launch of KaylaRe Ltd, with Stone Point and Hillhouse Capital Management Ltd. The new firm, with initial capital of $620 million, is a Bermuda-based, Class 4 reinsurer offering a diversified range of specialty reinsurance to the global market. KaylaRe aims to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns over market cycles through a diversified asset allocation and careful, selective underwriting. www.kaylare.com
