History[edit]
Officially presented to the public in April 2010 at the International Lingerie Show in Las Vegas, Nevada,[2] the company was started by Internetmarketing-Miami, LLC.[3] Deriving its company name from the Italian word “kisses”, the company invested huge amount of money in advertising and marketing campaigns[4] and exhibiting at several industry shows around the world, like Venus Fair in Berlin, Germany during October 2010[5] and Salon de la Lingerie Show in Paris, France in January 2011.[6]
Products and marketing[edit]
The shoots have featured castles in Southern Germany, the United Kingdom, and France.[7] The resulting images are used in Baci’s packaging, website, and catalogs.[8]
Baci Lingerie coordinated a photo shoot in 2013, which took place in a Hollywood Hills mansion and featured its 23-piece Corsets by Baci Collection.[9]
Baci Lingerie provides tools for retailers in merchandising and marketing, including planograms,[10] creative events (including the Baci Lash Bar),[11][12] educational tools (newsletters, merchandising plans, seminars, blogs),[13] and contests.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
Baci Lingerie claims to have philosophy of social consciousness and philanthropy as its integral aspects.[15] Through contributions and fundraisers, including Baci’s annual charity dinner,[16] the company raises money for a variety of organizations and causes.
Eileen Stein Jacoby Fund[edit]
Baci Lingerie raised over $8,000 for the Fox Chase Cancer Center and Eileen Stein Jacoby Fund to advance cancer research and education, at Baci’s second semiannual charity dinner in April 2013.[17] The charity dinner was held during the International Lingerie Show.[18] Baci raised $4,400 for the fund in 2012.[19]
Bra Recyclers[edit]
Baci Lingerie supported The Bra Recyclers in its drive to collect 15,000 bras in October 2012 to help raise awareness of Breast Cancer and Domestic Violence Month.[20] The Bra Recyclers is a textile recycling company that specializes in recycling and reusing bras that would unnecessarily go to landfills, and assist in providing deserving women with used or unused bras as they transition back to self-sufficiency.[21]
Revlon Run / Walk[edit]
Baci Lingerie participated in the 2013 Entertainment Industry Fund (EIF) Revlon Run / Walk For Women, to raise funds for women’s cancer research.[22] Approximately 15 Baci employees, family members, and friends participated in the 20th annual 5k run / walk fundraiser as “Team Baci Babes” on May 11th, 2013, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at Exposition Park.[23]
XO Oklahoma[edit]
Baci Lingerie donated 1176 brand new bras of various styles to victims of the 2013 tornadoes in Moore, Oklahoma – a total retail value of over $15,000.[24] Hugs and Kisses, or XO, is a project by the Kerr Foundation, formed to gather and distribute new and gently used clothing and accessory items for women and men affected by the Moore tornado disaster.[25]
Free The Girls[edit]
Baci Lingerie donated 5077 brand new bras of various styles – a total retail value of over $60,000.[26] Free The Girls provides an opportunity for women rescued from sex trafficking to earn a living selling second-hand clothing, while going to school, getting healthy, and caring for their families.[27]

History[edit]
Officially presented to the public in April 2010 at the International Lingerie Show in Las Vegas, Nevada,[2] the company was started by Internetmarketing-Miami, LLC.[3] Deriving its company name from the Italian word “kisses”, the company invested huge amount of money in advertising and marketing campaigns[4] and exhibiting at several industry shows around the world, like Venus Fair in Berlin, Germany during October 2010[5] and Salon de la Lingerie Show in Paris, France in January 2011.[6]
Products and marketing[edit]
The shoots have featured castles in Southern Germany, the United Kingdom, and France.[7] The resulting images are used in Baci’s packaging, website, and catalogs.[8]
Baci Lingerie coordinated a photo shoot in 2013, which took place in a Hollywood Hills mansion and featured its 23-piece Corsets by Baci Collection.[9]
Baci Lingerie provides tools for retailers in merchandising and marketing, including planograms,[10] creative events (including the Baci Lash Bar),[11][12] educational tools (newsletters, merchandising plans, seminars, blogs),[13] and contests.[14]
Philanthropy[edit]
Baci Lingerie claims to have philosophy of social consciousness and philanthropy as its integral aspects.[15] Through contributions and fundraisers, including Baci’s annual charity dinner,[16] the company raises money for a variety of organizations and causes.

Baci Lingerie raised over $8,000 for the Fox Chase Cancer Center and Eileen Stein Jacoby Fund to advance cancer research and education, at Baci’s second semiannual charity dinner in April 2013.[17] The charity dinner was held during the International Lingerie Show.[18] Baci raised $4,400 for the fund in 2012.[19]
Bra Recyclers[edit]
Baci Lingerie supported The Bra Recyclers in its drive to collect 15,000 bras in October 2012 to help raise awareness of Breast Cancer and Domestic Violence Month.[20] The Bra Recyclers is a textile recycling company that specializes in recycling and reusing bras that would unnecessarily go to landfills, and assist in providing deserving women with used or unused bras as they transition back to self-sufficiency.[21]
Revlon Run / Walk[edit]
Baci Lingerie participated in the 2013 Entertainment Industry Fund (EIF) Revlon Run / Walk For Women, to raise funds for women’s cancer research.[22] Approximately 15 Baci employees, family members, and friends participated in the 20th annual 5k run / walk fundraiser as “Team Baci Babes” on May 11th, 2013, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at Exposition Park.[23]

COLOR.ME
The Choices We Make…
Born from KEVIN.MURPHY’s vision of fusing session work, fashion and hair colour.
This compact colour line delivers high performance, natural looking results and optimum colour functionality. An artful blend of gentle and “from the earth” ingredients naturally moisturise, rejuvenate and impart incredible shine without having to further compromise the environment.
What goes inside the tube is just as important as the colour it creates. The choices we made are PPD Free & Ammonia Free. We use naturally derived ingredients like Shea Butter, Pomegranate, Aloe Vera and Honey.
Product performance is very important to me, 100% grey coverage was a definite. Multi-tonal effect and a small flexible range were features that I thought were absolutely essential.

 Collections
Copper Glint
A soft lightening technique in bold fashion colours such as tangerines, mangoes and golden blondes delivering a naturally sun-kissed effect. Copper glint delivers fresh, no-fuss results.
Salted Amethyst
A sophisticated, perennial evolution of pinks and violets in dusty and muted tones that can be worn year round.
Transparent pale violets, sandy beiges and minky pink blonde blend seamlessly with soft, metallic finishes to create soft -yet striking- results with luminous shine.
Granite Coco
The evolution of balayage, “foilyage” features precisely placed foils that give the illusion of seamless, natural highlighting. These multiple variations of tones and reflection of light are found in nature.
A play on blonde/brunette shades with a metallic edge, we are seeing brunette shades flowing subtly onto lightened ends, making the new blonde: Granite Coco.
Fool’s Gold
Inspired by precious metals and rose gold finishes on bags, clothing and jewelry, apricot, golden blonde and sun-kissed hues with a soft, muted edge take center stage.
Foils working from the front hairlines in very fine pieces called ‘baby lights’ provide a soft, natural result while enhancing the texture around the face.

Color Wow
Wow Your Clients! With Award-winning Color Wow Root Cover Up
The breakthrough, must-have for every client with color-treated or highlighted hair. This innovative mineral powder formula instantly covers gray roots – and even dark regrowth in blonde and highlighted hair without peroxide. Help your clients cheat grey and dark roots until their next appointment!

Adheres to hair without being sticky or oily and without dulling

Water-resistant formula covers roots until it’s shampooed out
Each shade contains a variety of pigments and reflective particles to ensure shades match seamlessly and look natural
Available in six versatile shades that provide dimensional shine

We carry Color Wow because there is nothing else like it in the professional market. It is the perfect root cover up for your clients in between color visits. I’m quite certain that this will become a major professional brand because not only is it so unique but also because its performance is exceptional. It’s a real winner and your clients will love it.
—KEN PAVES
See your Beauty Solutions Representative to order or call 1-888-973-7546. You can also order online.
 
HOW TO APPLY COLOR WOW

We recommend using the smaller end of the brush for precision
Apply to dry/styled hair.
To cover roots, start with a small amount of powder. Use free hand to pull hair taut at the root. Dab on visible ]roots, starting from the scalp and working outward. Repeat as necessary until roots disappear and color looks like new.
To extend highlights, use the side edge of the small end of the brush. Use free hand to pull hair taut at the root. Wherever highlights have grown out, apply blonde powder joining it to the existing highlight.
Note: Let it set for a minute and then you can brush. If you put too much on… just blow off with a hair dryer or use the wide end of brush to dust off.

Pigments – Colors Everything
April 27, 2016 By Wes Brown 4 Comments 
PURE COLOR PIGMENTS!
The secret components in each of our unique color brands are now available for each hairstylist to create, innovate and provide endless customized in-salon services for every customer, regardless of their own specific needs and requirements.
The Structure
PIGMENTS are enclosed in a sphere of cellulose. Their molecules are free to “float”, scattered in tiny spaces of the vegetal twine where they remain intact, ready to perform. During the mixing process, the sphere of cellulose melts, keeping the pigments’ structure and performance functional.
Pigments are Polarized
Because PIGMENTS can adapt to whatever pH ambient they find, they can be used effectively in all your in-salon services… Color, keratin treaments, and shampoos and conditioners.
In-Salon Services:
1) MIXED WITH WATER:
PIGMENTS mixed with WATER are used for corrective color (re-pigmentation).
2) MIXED WITH COLOR
The PIGMENTS mixed with COLOR are used to boost or create new shades.
3) MIXED WITH KERATIN
The PIGMENTS mixed with KERATIN are used to enrich and correct color.

These pigments are very exciting! I’d like to know more.
Do you have a kit deal that includes all the pigments?

about us - ovo ® | lifestyle toys for everyone ®ovo ® | lifestyle toys for everyone ® about us     Pleasure product manufacturer OVO Lifestyle Toys™ first introduced their lineup at the 2012 eroFame show. Attendees couldn’t miss OVO’s gleaming white display area and extensive signage throughout the hall. Originally based in Berlin, OVO didn’t go very far from home for its first show. The manufacturer then headed to Paris in early 2013, offering buyers a second look at their selection during the Salon International de la Lingerie in Paris.  Following its 2014 change in ownership, the company is now controlled by OVO Joint Venture, a U.S.-based group of industry veterans lead by Frank Koretsky.       Form follows function in OVO’s sleek designs, but beauty is not sacrificed in these lifestyle toys for everyone. Made of silicone and designed and engineered in Germany, all of the products are backed by a 15-year warranty. The packaging is as simply elegant as the products themselves, and the materials used are body safe and phthalate-free.       All products have either won or received honorable mention at recent Red Dot international design awards – a recognition previously achieved by major, mainstream manufacturers like Dyson and Mercedes Benz.      OVO Lifestyle Toys™ current range of products is broken up into distinct categories including pleasure rings, loveballs (aka Kegel exercisers), bullets, mini vibes, vibrators, rabbits, and lay-ons.  In addition to the design awards, the company holds 17 patents for a variety of its products' features.    In addition to the products themselves, OVO also offers retailers attractive, award-winning POP display options.  The ovo pleasure ring counter display received the VISCOM Bronze Medal in the international exhibition - high quality category.

Designed with Hair in Mind



Our professional implement and accessories line was designed with the integrity of hair in mind. Our company understands.

We’ve created professional styling implements that nourish the hair while delivering powerful and effective results.
