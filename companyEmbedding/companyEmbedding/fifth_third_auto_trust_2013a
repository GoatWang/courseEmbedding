Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

It’s smart to go to college. It’s even smarter to plan ahead. If you have a child or grandchild and you want to start saving for their education, you’re in the right place.

The Owner Trustee is hereby
authorized to engage in the foregoing activities on behalf of the

Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will hold the

It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Issuer
constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust Act and that
(i) this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of such
statutory trust and (ii) for United States federal, state and
local income, franchise and value added tax purposes, the Issuer
shall be treated as a grantor trust of the type described in
Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-4(c), with the assets of the
Issuer constituting the Receivables and other assets held by the
Issuer, and the Notes constituting non-recourse debt of the
Certificateholder(s), provided that if it is successfully asserted
by the appropriate tax authorities that the Issuer is not properly
characterized as a grantor trust of the type described in Treasury
Regulation section 301.7701-4(c), the Issuer shall be treated, for
United States federal, state and local income, franchise and value
added tax purposes, as (A) a disregarded entity if there is
only one beneficial owner of the Certificates and any Notes that
are treated as equity in the Issuer, or (B) a partnership
(other than an association or publicly traded partnership taxable
as a corporation) if there is more than one beneficial owner of the
Certificates and any Notes that are treated as equity in the
Issuer, with the assets of the partnership being the Receivables
and other assets held by the Issuer, the partners of the
partnership being the Certificateholders and the holders of the
Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer, and the remaining
Notes constituting indebtedness of the partnership. The parties
hereto and each Certificateholder, by acceptance of a Certificate,
agree to treat the Issuer in accordance with the intention that the
Issuer be characterized as a grantor trust of the type described in
Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-4(c) and, unless otherwise
required by appropriate taxing authorities or by law, not to take
any action or, direct any other party to take any action,
inconsistent therewith, including, but not limited to, modifying,
or directing any other party to modify, the terms of a Receivable
unless the modification is a Permitted Modification. The provisions
of this Trust Agreement shall be interpreted consistent with and to
further this intention of the parties. The parties agree that,
unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities, the
Issuer will file or cause to be filed

annual or other necessary tax returns, reports
and other forms consistent with the foregoing characterization of
the Issuer for United States federal, state and local income,
franchise and value added tax purposes. No election will be made by
or on behalf of the Issuer to be classified as an association

purposes. Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee shall
have all rights, powers and duties set forth herein and, to the
extent not inconsistent herewith, in the Statutory Trust Act with
respect to accomplishing the purposes of the Issuer. The Owner
Trustee filed the Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as required by Section 3810(a) of the
Statutory Trust Act, such filing hereby being ratified and approved
in all respects. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the

trust” within the meaning of Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the
failure to do so would materially and adversely affect the ability
of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents.

Contravention . The execution, delivery and performance by the
Depositor of each Transaction Document to which it is a party
(i) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of the Depositor and (ii) do not contravene or constitute
a default under (A) any applicable law, rule or regulation,
(B) its organizational instruments or (C) any material
agreement, contract, order or other instrument to which it is a
party or its property is subject (other than violations of such
laws, rules, regulations, indenture or agreements which do not
affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of such
agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by,
or the Depositor’s ability to perform its obligations under,
the Transaction Documents to which it is a party).

Transaction Document to which the Depositor is a party constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Depositor
enforceable against the Depositor in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership,
conservatorship or other similar laws affecting creditors’
rights generally and, if applicable the rights of creditors of
limited liability companies from time to time in effect or by
general principles of equity or other similar laws of general
application relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles
of equity.

(e) No Proceedings . There is
no action, suit, Proceeding or investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of the Depositor, threatened against the Depositor which,
either in any one instance or in the aggregate, would result in any
material adverse change in the business, operations, financial
condition, properties or assets of the Depositor, or in any
material impairment of the right or ability of the Depositor to
carry on its business substantially as now conducted, or in any
material liability on the part of the Depositor, or which would
render invalid this Agreement or the Receivables or the obligations
of the Depositor contemplated herein, or which would materially
impair the ability of the Depositor to perform under the terms of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

(f) Situs of Issuer . The

(2013-A)







SECTION 3.2 Authentication of
Certificates . (a) Concurrently with the sale of the
Transferred Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale Agreement,
the Owner Trustee shall cause the initial Certificate to be
executed on behalf of the Issuer, authenticated and delivered to or
upon the written order of the Depositor, signed by its chairman of
the board, its president, its chief financial officer, its chief
accounting officer, any vice president, its secretary, any
assistant secretary, its treasurer or any assistant treasurer,
without further corporate action by the Depositor.

100% of the beneficial interest in the Issuer and shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be fully paid and
nonassessable.

SECTION 3.3 Form of the
Certificates . The initial Certificate, upon issuance, will be
a typewritten, definitive Certificate, substantially in the form of

SECTION 3.4 Registration of
Certificates . The Owner Trustee, in its capacity as
“Certificate Registrar” shall maintain at its office
referred to in Section 2.2 , or at the office of any
agent appointed by it and approved in writing by the

“ Certificate Register ”) for the registration
and transfer of any Certificate, and the Owner Trustee or such
agent shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee of any change in
the registered ownership of a Certificate. Prior to the presentment
for registration of transfer of any Certificate, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee or any agent of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and the Depositor may treat the Person in whose
name any Certificate is registered (as of the applicable Record
Date) as the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving
distributions on such Certificate and for all other purposes
whatsoever and unless the Certificate Register is notified of such
change in ownership the only available recourse such transferee
shall have shall be to the person in whose name the related
Certificate is registered. For the avoidance of doubt, the records
maintained by the Owner Trustee in the Certificate Register with
respect to each Certificate and its related registered owner are
intended to cause the Certificates to be issued in registered form,
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 5f.103-1(c), and
shall record (a) the Percentage Interest in all of the assets
of and the right to distributions from, the Issuer evidenced by
each Certificate and (b) all distributions made to each
Certificateholder with respect to the Issuer’s
assets.

SECTION 3.5 Transfer of

convey or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title and
interest in the related Certificate; provided ,
that:

Affiliate of the Depositor or (b) (1) is a Qualified
Institutional Buyer, (2) is aware that the sale of the
Certificates to it is being made in reliance on the exemption from
registration provided by Rule 144A, and (3) is acquiring the
Certificates for its own account or for one or more accounts, each
of which is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and as to each of
which the owner exercises sole investment discretion or for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A;

(2013-A)







(ii) such transferee understands
that the Certificates will bear the applicable legends set forth in
Section 3.5(g) ;

(iii) such transferee understands
that the Certificates are being offered only in a transaction not
involving any public offering in the United States within the
meaning of the Securities Act, none of the Certificates have been
or will be registered under the Securities Act, and, if in the
future the transferee decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise
transfer the Certificates, such Certificates may only be offered,
resold, pledged or otherwise transferred in accordance with this
Agreement and the applicable legend on such Certificates set forth
below;

(iv) such transferee understands
that an investment in the Certificates involves certain risks,
including the risk of loss of all or a substantial part of its
investment under certain circumstances. The transferee has had
access to such financial and other information concerning the
Issuer and the Certificates as it deemed necessary or appropriate
in order to make an informed investment decision with respect to
its purchase of the Certificates. The transferee has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that the
transferee is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Certificates, and the transferee and any accounts
for which it is acting are each able to bear the economic risk of
the holder’s or of its investment;

(v) such transferee will not offer,
transfer, pledge, sell or otherwise dispose of the Certificates or
any interest in the Certificates to any Person in any manner, or
solicit any offer to buy, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of
the Certificates or any interest in the Certificates from any
Person in any manner, or make any general solicitation by means of
general advertising or in any other manner, or take any other
action that would constitute a distribution of the Certificates
under the Securities Act or that would render the disposition of
the Certificates a violation of Section 5 of the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws or require registration
pursuant thereto, and will not authorize any Person to act on its
behalf, in such manner with respect to the Certificates;

(vi) the Owner Trustee and the
Issuer determine (based on the advice of counsel or such other
information as they deem necessary or advisable) that the transfer
complies with the requirements of clauses (d)  and
(e)  of this Section 3.5 ;

(vii) such Certificate may not be
acquired by or for the account of or with the assets of a Benefit
Plan or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is
subject to any Similar Law;

(viii) the transferee provides a
Certificate Investor Representation Letter substantially in the
form of Exhibit B ; and

(ix) such transferee acknowledges
that the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Placement Agent and others
will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







acknowledgements, representations,
warranties and agreements in this Section 3.5 and
agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations,
warranties or agreements made by it in connection with its purchase
of the Certificates are no longer accurate, the transferee will
promptly notify the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Placement
Agent.

Each Certificateholder will
represent and warrant that it is not (and will not be) a Benefit
Plan or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is
subject to any Similar Law and is not (and will not be) accepting
or holding such Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of
or with assets of a Benefit Plan or a governmental, non-U.S. or
church plan which is subject to Similar Law. The Owner Trustee
shall have no duty to independently determine that the requirement
in (vi) above is met and shall incur no liability to any
Person in the event the Certificateholder does not comply with such
restrictions. Subject to the transfer restrictions contained herein
and in the Certificates, any Certificateholder may transfer all or
any portion of the Percentage Interest evidenced by such
Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee accompanied
by the documents required by this Section. Such transfer may be
made by a registered Certificateholder in person or by his attorney
duly authorized in writing upon surrender of the Certificate to the
Owner Trustee accompanied by (a) a written instrument of
transfer in the form of the “Assignment” attached to
the Form of Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit A and
with such signature guarantees and evidence of authority of the
Persons signing the instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may
reasonably require; provided, however , that the Owner
Trustee shall not require the signature of the Depositor to be
medallion guaranteed for the transfers from the Depositor to the
applicable transferees on the date hereof, (b) an executed
direction letter regarding registration of such transfer in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit D , and (c) the
documents required by Sections 3.5(a)(viii) and
3.5(e) hereof. Promptly upon the receipt of such documents
and receipt by the Owner Trustee of the transferor’s
Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall record the name of such
transferee as a Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in
the Certificate Register and issue, execute and deliver to such
Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such Percentage
Interest. In the event a transferor transfers only a portion of its
Percentage Interest, the Owner Trustee shall register and issue to
such transferor a new Certificate evidencing such
transferor’s new Percentage Interest and shall issue, execute
and deliver to such transferee a new Certificate evidencing such
transferee’s Percentage Interest. Subsequent to each transfer
of beneficial interest and upon the issuance of the new Certificate
or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel and destroy the
Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such transfer. The
Owner Trustee may treat, for all purposes whatsoever (other than
for purposes of clauses (d)  and (e)  of
this Section 3.5 ), the Person in whose name any
Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the Percentage
Interest evidenced by such Certificate.

(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.5 , the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(c) The Owner Trustee shall not be
obligated to register any transfer of a Certificate unless the
transferee has certified to the Owner Trustee that such transfer
does not

violate any of the transfer restrictions stated
herein including, but not limited to clauses (d)  and
(e)  of this Section 3.5 . The Owner
Trustee shall not be liable to any Person for registering any
transfer based on such certifications.

(d) No transfer shall be permitted
if such transfer is effected through an established securities
market or secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)
within the meaning of Code section 7704 and any proposed, temporary
or final Treasury regulations thereunder.

(e) Each registered owner of and, if
different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate
that is a “United States person” (as defined in Code
section 7701(a)(30)) shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Administrator and the Certificate Paying Agent two properly
completed and duly executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) certifying that it
is not subject to backup withholding. Each registered owner of and,
if different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate
that is not a “United States person” shall deliver to
the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate Paying
Agent two properly completed and duly executed originals of U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (Certification of Foreign
Status as Beneficial Owner), IRS Form W-8IMY (Certification of
Foreign Intermediary Status) or IRS Form W-8ECI (Certification of
Foreign Person’s Claim for Exemption from Withholding on
Income Effectively Connected with Conduct of a U.S. Trade or
Business), or any successors to such IRS forms (i) to permit
the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate Paying
Agent to make payments to the purchaser without, or at a reduced
rate of, withholding, (ii) to enable the Issuer to qualify for
a reduced rate of withholding in any jurisdiction from or through
which the Issuer receives payments on its assets, or (iii) to
enable the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate
Paying Agent to satisfy any reporting or other obligations under
any applicable tax law, and will update or replace such form,
certification or other information as necessary in accordance with
its terms or its subsequent amendments.

The applicable Internal Revenue
Service forms required to be delivered, as described above, shall
be delivered on or prior to the date on which a Certificateholder
becomes a Certificateholder under this Agreement and from time to
time thereafter as prescribed by applicable law or upon the request
of the Certificate Paying Agent.

In addition, each registered owner
of and, if different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a
Certificate that is not a “United States person” within
the meaning of section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, shall submit a
statement certifying that it is not a “controlled foreign
corporation” that is related to the Issuer, within the
meaning of section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code.

Each purchaser, beneficial owner and
subsequent transferee of a Certificate or an interest therein shall
provide to the Issuer and the Owner Trustee, on or prior to, and
after, the date of its acquisition of a Certificate or beneficial
interest, any information requested by the Issuer and the Owner
Trustee as is necessary (as determined in the sole discretion of
the Issuer or the Owner Trustee, as applicable) for the Issuer and
the Owner Trustee to determine the obligations of any party under
this Agreement pursuant to Code sections 1471-1474 (the “
FATCA Provisions ”), including whether such purchaser,
beneficial owner or transferee is a U.S. Person or a
non-U.S.

person, and if such purchaser, beneficial owner
or transferee is a non-U.S. person whether it is a foreign
financial institution (“ FFI ”) as defined in
Code section 1471(d)(4) or a non-financial foreign entity as
defined in Code section 1472(d) (“ non-FFI
”).

If a purchaser, beneficial owner or
transferee of a Certificate is, or would be, a FFI, such FFI shall
represent (or shall be deemed by acceptance of its Certificate or
interest therein to represent) to the Issuer and Owner Trustee that
it has met (or will meet as soon as applicable guidance is issued
by the IRS) the reporting requirements of Code section 1471(b)
(“ FFI Reporting Obligations ”), and such FFI
shall further represent and agree that it shall continue to meet
its FFI Reporting Obligations and has not made (and will not
make) the election to be withheld upon pursuant to Code
section 1471(b)(3). If a purchaser, beneficial owner or transferee
of a Certificate is, or would be, a non-FFI such non-FFI shall,
when applicable law requires a non-FFI to meet the reporting
requirements of Code section 1472(b) either (i) represent (or
shall be deemed by acceptance of its Certificate or interest
therein to represent) to the Issuer and Owner Trustee that it does
not have (or will not have as soon as applicable guidance is issued
by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service) any substantial United States
owners within the meaning of Code section 1472(b)(1)(A) or
(ii) provide to the Issuer and Owner Trustee the name,
address, and taxpayer identification number of each of its
substantial United States owners and any other information required
by Code section 1472.

Each purchaser, beneficial owner and
subsequent transferee of Certificates or an interest therein will
be required or deemed to acknowledge that the Issuer may provide
such information and any other information concerning its
investment in the Certificates to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service. In addition, each purchaser, beneficial owner and
subsequent transferee of Certificates or an interest therein will
be required or deemed to understand and acknowledge that the Issuer
has the right, hereunder, to withhold on any beneficial owner of an
interest in a Certificate that fails to comply with the foregoing
requirements.

(f) If a Responsible Officer of
Owner Trustee becomes aware that (1) a transfer or attempted
or purported transfer of any Certificate or interest therein was
consummated in compliance with the provisions of this
Section 3.5 on the basis of a materially incorrect
certification from the transferor or purported transferee,
(2) a transferee failed to deliver to the Owner Trustee the
certificate required to be delivered under
Section 3.5(a)(viii) or (3) the Certificateholder of any
Certificate or interest therein is in material breach of any
representation or agreement set forth in any certificate or any
deemed representation or agreement of such Certificateholder, the
Owner Trustee will direct the Certificate Registrar not to register
such attempted or purported transfer and, if a transfer has been
registered, such transfer shall be absolutely null and void ab
initio and shall not operate to transfer any rights to the
purported transferee (such purported transferee, a
“Disqualified Transferee”) and the last preceding
Certificateholder of such Certificateholder that was not a
Disqualified Transferee shall be restored to all rights as a
Certificateholder thereof retroactively to the date of the
purported transfer of such Certificate by such
Certificateholder.

(g) Each Certificate will bear a
legend to the following effect:

“THIS CERTIFICATE HAS NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
“SECURITIES ACT”) OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR
“BLUE SKY” LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. THE
HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING THIS CERTIFICATE, AGREES THAT THIS
CERTIFICATE MAY BE RESOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED ONLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
OF THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR
“BLUE SKY” LAWS AND ONLY PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”) TO A PERSON THAT THE
HOLDER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER
WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A (A “QIB”), PURCHASING
FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR THE ACCOUNT OF A QIB, WHOM THE HOLDER HAS
INFORMED THAT THE REOFFER, RESALE OR OTHER TRANSFER IS BEING MADE
IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A.”

SECTION 3.6 Lost, Stolen,
Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates . If (i) any mutilated
Certificate is surrendered to the Owner Trustee, or (ii) the
Owner Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction that any
Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of
ownership satisfactory to the Owner Trustee together with such
security or indemnity on behalf of the Issuer as may be requested
by the Owner Trustee to save it harmless, then, in the absence of
notice to the Owner Trustee that such Certificate has been acquired
by a protected purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall execute and
deliver a new Certificate for the same Percentage Interest in the
Issuer as the Certificate so mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen,
of like tenor and bearing a different issue number, with such
notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee shall determine. Upon the
issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 3.6
, the Issuer or Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of the
Certificate and any other reasonable expenses (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer and the Owner Trustee)
connected therewith. If, after the delivery of such new Certificate
a protected purchaser of the original Certificate in lieu of which
such new Certificate was issued presents such original Certificate
for transfer or payment, the Issuer and Owner Trustee shall be
entitled to recover such new Certificate from the Person to whom it

evidence of ownership in the Issuer, as if originally issued,
whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be
found at any time. The provisions of this Section 3.6 are

Trustee a written agreement in which such successor Certificate
Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent shall agree
with the Owner Trustee that, as Certificate Paying Agent, such
successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying
Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
to such Certificateholders. Subject to applicable laws, with
respect to the escheat of funds, the Certificate Paying Agent shall
return all funds that have remained unclaimed by a
Certificateholder for two years to the Owner Trustee. Immediately

foregoing purposes. The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to
the Owner Trustee of the location, and of any change in the
location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer
shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to
furnish the Owner Trustee with the address thereof, such

DUTIES

SECTION 5.1 Application of Trust
Funds . Deposits into the Certificate Distribution Account
shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture
and this Agreement. On each Payment Date, the Certificate Paying
Agent shall withdraw from the Certificate Distribution Account and
distribute to the Certificateholders, pro rata based on the
Percentage Interest of each Certificateholder, all funds received

Agreement. Subject to the lien of the Indenture, the Certificate
Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to the Certificateholders
all other amounts (if any) received by the Certificate Paying Agent
on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Trust Estate (pro rata
based on the Percentage Interest of each such Certificateholder).
After the termination of the Indenture in accordance with its
terms, the Certificate Paying Agent shall distribute all amounts
received (if any) by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer in
respect of the Trust Estate in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. If any withholding tax is imposed on any Issuer
payment to, or is imposed on any allocable Issuer income of, a

Section 5.1 ; provided that the Owner Trustee
shall not have an obligation to withhold any such amount if and for

(but such authorization shall not prevent the
Owner Trustee from contesting any such tax in appropriate
proceedings and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by
law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any
withholding tax imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall
be treated as cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the
time it is withheld by the Issuer and remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to a distribution or income allocation, the
Owner Trustee may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in
accordance with this Section 5.1 . If a
Certificateholder wishes to apply for a refund of any such
withholding tax, the Owner Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with
such Certificateholder in making such claim so long as such
Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Owner Trustee for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred.

SECTION 5.2 Sarbanes-Oxley
Act . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any
Transaction Document, the Owner Trustee shall not be required to
execute, deliver or certify in accordance with the provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on behalf of the Issuer or any other Person,
any periodic reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, or any
other documents pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

SECTION 5.3 Signature on
Returns . The Owner Trustee shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) and shall sign, on behalf of the Issuer, the
Issuer’s tax returns, if any, unless applicable law requires
a Certificateholder to sign such documents. In the event that the
Issuer is required to be treated as a partnership for United States
federal income tax purposes, the Certificateholder that is a United
States Person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30)
holding the largest Certificate Percentage Interest shall be
designated the “tax matters partner” of the Issuer
pursuant to Code section 6231(a)(7)(A) of the Code and shall sign
the tax return of the Issuer. In the event that two or more
Certificateholders would be described in the preceding sentence
then Certificateholder with the alphabetically first name shall be
so designated and in the event that no Certificateholder is a
United States Person within the meaning of
Section 7701(a)(30), the requirements of this
Section 5.3 shall be applied without regard to such
consideration.

SECTION 5.4 Accounting and
Reports to Certificateholders, the Internal Revenue Service and
Others . The Owner Trustee shall (a) maintain (or cause to
be maintained) the books of the Issuer on a calendar year basis and
the accrual method of accounting, (b) deliver (or cause to be
delivered) to each Certificateholder, as may be required by the
Code and applicable Treasury Regulations, such information as may
be required (including, if applicable, Schedule K-1) to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal and state income tax
returns, (c) prepare (or cause to be prepared), file (or cause
to be filed) such tax returns relating to the Issuer (including, if
applicable, a trust return IRS Form 1041, reporting for widely held
fixed investment trusts under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.671-5, or a partnership information return, IRS Form
1065 if the Issuer is treated as a partnership for United States
federal income tax purposes) and make such elections as from time
to time may be required or appropriate under any applicable state
or federal statute or any rule or regulation thereunder so as to
maintain the Issuer’s tax characterization as described in
Section 2.6 hereof, (d) cause applicable tax
returns to be signed in the manner required by law and
(e) collect or cause to be collected any withholding tax as
described in and in accordance with Section 5.1 with
respect to income or distributions to
Certificateholders.

. Subject to the Indenture, distributions required to be made to a
Certificateholder on any Payment Date and all amounts received by
the Issuer or the Owner Trustee on any other date that are payable
to a Certificateholder pursuant to this Agreement or any other

such Certificateholder designated by such Certificateholder to the
Owner Trustee in writing.

provided herein or in the Indenture, the Certificate Distribution
Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of the
Certificate Paying Agent for the benefit of the Certificateholders.
If, at any time, the Certificate Distribution Account ceases to be
an Eligible Account, the Owner Trustee (or the Servicer on behalf
of the Owner Trustee, if the Certificate Distribution Account is
not then held by the Owner Trustee or an Affiliate thereof) shall
within ten (10) Business Days establish a new Certificate
Distribution Account as an Eligible Account and shall transfer any
cash then on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account to
such new Certificate Distribution Account.

SECTION 5.7 No Reinvestment .
The Certificate Paying Agent shall distribute all amounts collected
in respect of the assets of the Issuer and neither the Certificate
Paying Agent nor the Owner Trustee shall apply any such amounts
toward the purchase of additional assets on behalf of the Issuer;
provided, however, that such amounts may be invested in Permitted
Investments but only until the next Payment Date, when they shall
be distributed.

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and to administer the Issuer in the interest of the
Certificateholders, subject to Transaction Documents, and in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have discharged

part of the Owner Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of
any Transaction Document or is otherwise contrary to
law.

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is
unable to decide between alternative courses of action permitted or
required by the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction Document
or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or any such provision is
ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to be, in
conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the event that
this Agreement permits any determination by the Owner Trustee or is
silent or is incomplete as to the course of action that the Owner
Trustee is required to take with respect to a particular set of
facts, the Owner Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such form
as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the
Certificateholders requesting instruction as to the course of
action to be adopted or application of such provision, and to the
extent the Owner Trustee acts or refrains from acting in good faith
in accordance with any written instruction of the Majority
Certificateholders (or, if specifically required, all
Certificateholders) received, the Owner Trustee shall not be liable
on account of such action or inaction to any Person. If the Owner
Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within ten
days of such notice (or within

such shorter period of time as
reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be necessary

no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it
by this Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any

Certificateholder or any other Person, unless such
Certificateholder or such Person has offered to the Owner Trustee
security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs,
expenses and liabilities that may be incurred by the Owner Trustee
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of
its counsel) therein or thereby, including such advances as the

payment with respect to, register, record, sell, dispose of, or
otherwise deal with the Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or
refrain from taking any action under, or in connection with, any
document contemplated hereby to which the Issuer or the Owner
Trustee is a party, except as expressly provided by the terms of
this Agreement or in any document or written instruction received
by the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 6.3 ; and no
implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement or
any Transaction Document against the Owner Trustee. The Owner
Trustee shall have no responsibility for filing any financing or
continuation statement in any public office at any time or to

with respect to the genuineness, value, sufficiency or validity of
the Trust Estate.

inconsistent with the purposes of the Issuer set forth in

of a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee, would for United
States federal income, state and local income and franchise tax
purposes, (i) affect the treatment of the Notes as
indebtedness, (ii) be deemed to cause a taxable exchange of
the Notes or (iii) cause the Issuer or any portion thereof to
be treated as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable
as a corporation, or cause the Issuer to be treated as other than a

reports or any information contained therein, and shall have no
liability in connection therewith. Delivery of the Monthly Servicer
Report to the Owner Trustee, as provided for in the Transaction

Owner Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s
Certificates).

SECTION 2.1 Conveyance of
Transferred Assets . In consideration of the Issuer’s
sale and delivery to, or upon the order of, the Seller of
(i) all of the Notes and (ii) the Certificate on the

set over, sell, contribute and otherwise convey to the Issuer
without recourse (subject to the obligations herein) on the Closing

hereunder or any agreement, document or instrument related

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
COVENANTS

SECTION 3.1 Representations and
Warranties of Seller . The Seller makes the following
representations and warranties as of the Closing Date on which the
Issuer will be deemed to have relied in acquiring the Transferred
Assets. The representations and warranties will survive the
conveyance of the Transferred Assets to the Issuer pursuant to this
Agreement and the pledge thereof by the Issuer to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture:

(a) Existence and Power . The
Seller is a limited liability company validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has, in all
material respects, all power and authority to carry on its business
as it is now conducted. The Seller has obtained all necessary
licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the failure to do
so would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Seller
to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents or
affect the enforceability or collectibility of the Receivables or
any other part of the Transferred Assets.

(b) Authorization and No
Contravention . The execution, delivery and performance by the
Seller of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party
(i) have been duly authorized by all necessary limited
liability company action on the part of the Seller and (ii) do
not contravene or constitute a default under (A) any
applicable law, rule or regulation, (B) its organizational
documents or (C) any material agreement, contract, order or
other instrument to which it is a party or its property is subject
(other than violations which do not affect the legality, validity
or enforceability of any of such agreements and which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely affect the
transactions contemplated by, or the Seller’s ability to
perform its obligations under, the Transaction
Documents).

(c) No Consent Required . No
approval or authorization by, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance
 












 



-2-


 



Sale Agreement
(2013-A)






by the Seller of any Transaction Document other
than (i) UCC filings, (ii) approvals and authorizations
that have previously been obtained and filings that have previously
been made and (iii) approvals, authorizations or filings
which, if not obtained or made, would not have a material adverse
effect on the enforceability or collectibility of the Receivables
or any other part of the Transferred Assets or would not materially
and adversely affect the ability of the Seller to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents.

(d) Binding Effect . Each
Transaction Document to which the Seller is a party constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller enforceable
against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, receivership, conservatorship or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights
generally and, if applicable, the rights of creditors of limited
liability companies from time to time in effect or by general
principles of equity.

(e) No Proceedings . There
are no actions, suits or Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge
of the Seller, threatened against the Seller before or by any
Governmental Authority that (i) assert the invalidity or
unenforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents, (ii) seek to prevent the issuance of the Notes or
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents,
(iii) seek any determination or ruling that would materially
and adversely affect the performance by the Seller of its
obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents or the collectibility or enforceability of the
Receivables, or (iv) relate to the Seller that would
materially and adversely affect the federal or Applicable Tax State
income, excise, franchise or similar tax attributes of the
Notes.

(f) Lien Filings . The Seller
is not aware of any material judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings
against the Seller.

SECTION 3.2 Liability of the
Seller .

(a) The Seller shall be liable in
accordance herewith only to the extent of the obligations
specifically undertaken by the Seller under this
Agreement.

(b) The Seller shall indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee from and against any loss, liability or expense
incurred by reason of the Seller’s violation of federal or
State securities laws in connection with the registration or the
sale of the Notes.

(c) The Seller will pay any and all
taxes levied or assessed upon the Issuer or upon all or any part of
the Trust Estate.

(d) Indemnification under this
Section 3.2 will survive the resignation or removal of
the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee and the termination of
this Agreement and will include, without limitation, reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation. If the
Seller has made any indemnity payments pursuant to this
Section 3.2 and the Person to or on behalf of whom such
payments are made thereafter collects any of such amounts from
others, such Person will promptly repay such amounts to the Seller,
without interest.

Sale Agreement
(2013-A)







(e) The Seller’s obligations
under this Section 3.2 are obligations solely of the
Seller and will not constitute a claim against the Seller to the
extent that the Seller does not have funds sufficient to make
payment of such obligations. In furtherance of and not in
derogation of the foregoing, the Issuer, the Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, by entering into or
accepting this Agreement, acknowledge and agree that they have no
right, title or interest in or to the Other Assets of the Seller.
To the extent that, notwithstanding the agreements and provisions
contained in the preceding sentence, the Issuer, the Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee either (i) asserts an
interest or claim to, or benefit from, Other Assets, or
(ii) is deemed to have any such interest, claim to, or benefit
in or from Other Assets, whether by operation of law, legal
process, pursuant to applicable provisions of insolvency laws or
otherwise (including by virtue of Section 1111(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code or any successor provision having similar effect
under the Bankruptcy Code), then the Issuer, the Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee further acknowledges and
agrees that any such interest, claim or benefit in or from Other
Assets is and will be expressly subordinated to the indefeasible
payment in full, which, under the terms of the relevant documents
relating to the securitization or conveyance of such Other Assets,
are entitled to be paid from, entitled to the benefits of, or
otherwise secured by such Other Assets (whether or not any such
entitlement or security interest is legally perfected or otherwise
entitled to a priority of distributions or application under
applicable law, including insolvency laws, and whether or not
asserted against the Seller), including the payment of
post-petition interest on such other obligations and liabilities.
This subordination agreement will be deemed a subordination
agreement within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code. The Issuer, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee
and the Owner Trustee each further acknowledges and agrees that no
adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of this
Section 3.2(e) and the terms of this
Section 3.2(e) may be enforced by an action for
specific performance. The provisions of this
Section 3.2(e) will be for the third party benefit of
those entitled to rely thereon and will survive the termination of
this Agreement.

SECTION 3.3 Merger or
Consolidation of, or Assumption of the Obligations of, Seller .
Any Person (i) into which the Seller may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, to which it may
sell or transfer its business and assets as a whole or
substantially as a whole, (ii) resulting from any merger,
sale, transfer, conversion, or consolidation to which the Seller
shall be a party, (iii) succeeding to the business of the
Seller, or (iv) more than 50% of the voting stock or voting
power and 50% or more of the economic equity of which is owned
directly or indirectly by Fifth Third Bancorp, which Person in any
of the foregoing cases executes an agreement of assumption to
perform every obligation of the Seller under this Agreement, will
be the successor to the Seller under this Agreement without the
execution or filing of any document or any further act on the part
of any of the parties to this Agreement anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding. The Seller shall provide notice of any
merger, conversion, consolidation or succession pursuant to this
Section 3.3 to the Administrator. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Seller enters into any of the foregoing
transactions and is not the surviving entity, the Seller will
deliver to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel either
(A) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all
financing statements and continuation statements and amendments
thereto have been executed and filed that are necessary to preserve
and protect the interest of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee,
respectively, in the Receivables, or (B) stating that, in the
opinion of such counsel, no such action is necessary to preserve
and protect such interest.

(2013-A)







SECTION 3.4 Seller May Own
Notes . The Seller, and any Affiliate of the Seller, may in its
individual or any other capacity become the owner or pledgee of
Notes with the same rights as it would have if it were not the
Seller or an Affiliate thereof, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein or in the other Transaction Documents. Except as
set forth herein or in the other Transaction Documents, Notes so
owned by the Seller or any such Affiliate will have an equal and
proportionate benefit under the provisions of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents, without preference, priority, or
distinction as among all of the Notes. Unless all Notes are owned
by the Issuer, the Seller, the Servicer, the Administrator or any
of their respective Affiliates, any Notes owned by the Issuer, the
Seller, the Servicer, the Administrator or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be disregarded with respect to the determination
of any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
vote or waiver hereunder or under any other Transaction
Document.

SECTION 3.5 Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Requirements . To the extent any documents are required to be
filed or any certification is required to be made with respect to
the Issuer or the Notes pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the
Issuer hereby authorizes the Seller to prepare, sign, certify and
file any such documents or certifications on behalf of the
Issuer.

SECTION 3.6 Compliance with
Organizational Documents . The Seller shall comply with its
limited liability company agreement and other organizational
documents.

SECTION 3.7 Representations and
Warranties of the Seller as to each Receivable . The Seller
hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth on
Schedule I as to the Receivables, sold, contributed,
transferred, assigned, set over and otherwise conveyed to the
Issuer under this Agreement on which such representations and
warranties the Issuer relies in acquiring the Receivables. Such
representations and warranties shall survive the Grant of the
Receivables by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the
Indenture. Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary contained
herein or in any other Transaction Document, the Seller shall not
be required to notify any insurer with respect to any Insurance
Policy obtained by an Obligor or to notify any Dealer about any
aspect of the transaction contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.

SECTION 3.8 Repurchase upon
Breach . Upon discovery by or notice to the Issuer or the
Seller of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.7 at the time such representations
and warranties were made which materially and adversely affects the
interests of the Issuer or the Noteholders, the party discovering
such breach or receiving such notice shall give prompt written
notice thereof to the other party; provided , that delivery
of a Servicer’s Certificate which identifies the Receivables
that are being or have been repurchased shall be deemed to
constitute prompt notice of such breach; provided ,
further , that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect any obligation of the Seller hereunder. If the breach
materially and adversely affects the interests of the Issuer or the
Noteholders in such Receivable, then the Seller shall either
(a) correct or cure such breach or (b) repurchase such
Receivable from the Issuer, in either case on or before the Payment
Date following the end of the Collection Period which includes the
60th day (or, if the Seller elects, an earlier date) after the date
that the Seller became aware or was notified of such breach. Any
such breach or failure will be deemed not to have a material and
adverse effect if such breach or failure does not affect the
ability of the Issuer (or its assignee) to receive and retain
timely payment in full on such Receivable. Any
 












 



-5-


 



Sale Agreement
(2013-A)






such purchase by the Seller shall be at a price
equal to the Repurchase Price. In consideration for such
repurchase, the Seller shall make (or shall cause to be made) a
payment to the Issuer equal to the Repurchase Price by depositing
such amount into the Collection Account prior to 11:00 a.m., New
York City time on the date of such repurchase, if such repurchase
date is not a Payment Date or, if such repurchase date is a Payment
Date, then prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior
to such repurchase date. Upon payment of such Repurchase Price by
the Seller, the Issuer shall release and shall execute and deliver
such instruments of release, transfer or assignment, in each case
without recourse or representation, as may be reasonably requested
by the Seller to evidence such release, transfer or assignment or
more effectively vest in the Seller or its designee any Receivable
and the related Transferred Assets repurchased pursuant hereto. It
is understood and agreed that the obligation of the Seller to
purchase any Receivable as described above shall constitute the
sole remedy respecting such breach available to the
Issuer.

SECTION 3.9 Protection of
Title .

(a) The Seller shall authorize and
file such financing statements and cause to be authorized and filed
such continuation and other statements, all in such manner and in
such places as may be required by law fully to preserve, maintain
and protect the interest of the Issuer under this Agreement in the
Receivables (other than any Related Security with respect thereto,
to the extent that the interest of the Issuer therein cannot be
perfected by the filing of a financing statement). The Seller shall
deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Issuer file-stamped
copies of, or filing receipts for, any document filed as provided
above, as soon as available following such filing.

(b) The Seller will notify the
Issuer in writing within ten (10) days following the
occurrence of (i) any change in the Seller’s
organizational structure as a limited liability company,
(ii) any change in the Seller’s “location”
(within the meaning of Section 9-307 of the UCC of all
applicable jurisdictions) and (iii) any change in the
Seller’s name and shall have taken all action prior to making
such change (or shall have made arrangements to take such action
substantially simultaneously with such change, if it is not
practicable to take such action in advance) reasonably necessary or
advisable in the opinion of the Issuer to amend all previously
filed financing statements or continuation statements described in
paragraph (a)  above. The Seller will at all times
maintain its “location” within the United
States.

(c) The Seller shall maintain (or
shall cause the Servicer to maintain) its computer systems so that,
from time to time after the conveyance under this Agreement of the
Receivables, the master computer records (including any backup
archives) that refer to a Receivable shall indicate clearly the
interest of the Issuer (or any subsequent assignee of the Issuer)
in such Receivable and that such Receivable is owned by such
Person. Indication of such Person’s interest in a Receivable
shall not be deleted from or modified on such computer systems
until, and only until, the related Receivable shall have been paid
in full or repurchased.

(d) If at any time the Seller shall
propose to sell, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer
any interest in motor vehicle receivables to any prospective
purchaser, lender or other transferee, the Seller shall give to
such prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee computer
tapes, records or printouts (including any restored from backup
archives) that, if they
 












 



-6-


 



Sale Agreement
(2013-A)






shall refer in any manner whatsoever to any
Receivable, shall indicate clearly that such Receivable has been
sold and is owned by the Issuer (or any subsequent assignee of the
Issuer).

SECTION 3.10 Other Liens or
Interests . Except for the conveyances and grants of security
interests pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, the Seller shall not sell, pledge, assign or transfer
the Receivables or other property transferred to the Issuer to any
other Person, or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist
any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any interest therein, and
the Seller shall defend the right, title and interest of the Issuer
in, to and under such Receivables or other property transferred to
the Issuer against all claims of third parties claiming through or
under the Seller.

SECTION 3.11 Perfection
Representations, Warranties and Covenants . The Seller hereby
makes the perfection representations, warranties and covenants set
forth on Schedule III hereto to the Issuer and the Issuer
shall be deemed to have relied on such representations, warranties
and covenants in acquiring the Transferred Assets.

SECTION 3.12 Compliance with the
FDIC Rule . The Seller (i) shall perform the covenants set
forth in Article XII of the Indenture applicable to it and
(ii) shall facilitate compliance with Article XII of
the Indenture by the Fifth Third Parties.

ARTICLE IV

MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 4.1 Transfers Intended as
Sale; Security Interest .

(a) Each of the parties hereto
expressly intends and agrees that the transfers contemplated and
effected under this Agreement are complete and absolute sales,
transfers, assignments and contributions rather than pledges or
assignments of only a security interest and shall be given effect
as such for all purposes. It is further the intention of the
parties hereto that the Receivables and related Transferred Assets
shall not be part of the Seller’s estate in the event of a
bankruptcy or insolvency of the Seller. The sales and transfers by
the Seller of the Receivables and related Transferred Assets
hereunder are and shall be without recourse to, or representation
or warranty (express or implied) by, the Seller, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein. The limited rights of
recourse specified herein against the Seller are intended to
provide a remedy for breach of representations and warranties
relating to the condition of the property sold, rather than to the
collectibility of the Receivables.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that the Receivables and other Transferred Assets are
held to be property of the Seller, or if for any reason this
Agreement is held or deemed to create indebtedness or a security
interest in the Receivables and other Transferred Assets, then it
is intended that:

(i) This Agreement shall be deemed
to be a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9
of the New York UCC and the UCC of any other applicable
jurisdiction;
 












 



-7-


 



Sale Agreement
(2013-A)







(ii) The conveyance provided for in
Section 2.1 shall be deemed to be a grant by the Seller
of, and the Seller hereby grants to the Issuer, a security interest
in all of its right (including the power to convey title thereto),
title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and
to the Receivables and other Transferred Assets, to secure such
indebtedness and the performance of the obligations of the Seller
hereunder;

(iii) The possession by the Issuer
or its agent of the Receivable Files and any other property that
constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel
paper shall be deemed to be “possession by the secured
party” or possession by the purchaser or a Person designated
by such purchaser, for purposes of perfecting the security interest
pursuant to the New York UCC and the UCC of any other applicable
jurisdiction; and

(iv) Notifications to Persons
holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts or
confirmations from Persons holding such property, shall be deemed
to be notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or
confirmations from, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the Issuer
for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under

intangible,” each as defined in the UCC.

Receivable.

No
Repossession . As of the
Cut-Off Date, no Financed Vehicle shall have been

Receivables . If such

origination, then such Receivable is not an “installment sale
contract” within the meaning of the Pennsylvania Motor
Vehicles Sales Finance Act, 69 P.S. §601 et. seq.



 



(s)


Electronic
Chattel Paper . As of the
Cut-Off Date, such Receivable did not cause the aggregate
Outstanding Principal Balance of all Receivables that constitute
“electronic chattel paper” (as defined in the UCC) to
exceed 2.50% of the Net Pool Balance as of the Cut-Off
Date.



 



(t)

A purchase and sale agreement is a document used in real estate transactions, when a seller property owner (''Seller'') sells a property to a company or individual (''Buyer''). This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.
