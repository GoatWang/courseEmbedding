Who doesn't need to get the best offer for their money -- especially of these tough economical times? There is no shortage of sales advertisements from vendors who would like your business: they're using preferred customer special offers, early parrot sales, midnight madness situations, coupon savings times, and pre- AND post-holiday sales. Precisely how do you select if their bargains are real?
The Government Trade Commission, the country's consumer protection organization, has some tips to obtain the most for your cash.
Check around. A "sale" price isn't always the "best" price. Some merchants may give you a sale price on an item for a limited time; others may discount the purchase price on a single item everyday. Having an item's manufacturer, model number, and other identifying information can help you to get the best price for that you want.Read sale advertising carefully. Some may say "quantities limited," "no rainfall bank checks," or "unavailable in any way stores." Before you come out the door, call ahead to be sure the merchant has the item in stock. If you're searching for a favorite or hard-to-find item, ask the merchant if he'd be willing to carry that until you can reach the store.Devote some time and travel costs under consideration. If something is available for sale, but it's way anywhere, how much are you truly saving once you element in your time, your transportation, and parking?
