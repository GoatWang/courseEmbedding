Featured Reviews










SkinMedica
Lytera 2.0 Pigment Correcting Serum
This serum has a lightweight, thin lotion texture and uses a cocktail approach to its formula (our favorite!), combining effective skin-lightening and brightening ingredients with antioxidants.

Rating:

$154.00












Paula's Choice Skincare
SKIN PERFECTING 8% AHA Lotion
This exfoliant gently and quickly does what it says: It reduces fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of firmness while revitalizing dull, dry skin. Bonus: It's loaded with soothing and moisturizing ingredients.

Rating:

$29.00












NARS
Radiance Primer SPF 35
Many people don't like the texture that sunscreen has under their makeup, so primers with SPF are a good way for people to get their sun protection while still having the benefits of a skin-smoothing formula. Just apply liberally!

$36.00

SkinMedica
Lytera 2.0 Pigment Correcting Serum
This serum has a lightweight, thin lotion texture and uses a cocktail approach to its formula (our favorite!), combining effective skin-lightening and brightening ingredients with antioxidants.

Rating:

Paula's Choice Skincare
SKIN PERFECTING 8% AHA Lotion
This exfoliant gently and quickly does what it says: It reduces fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of firmness while revitalizing dull, dry skin. Bonus: It's loaded with soothing and moisturizing ingredients.

Rating:

$29.00












NARS
Radiance Primer SPF 35
Many people don't like the texture that sunscreen has under their makeup, so primers with SPF are a good way for people to get their sun protection while still having the benefits of a skin-smoothing formula. Just apply liberally!

There is a staff that writes "expert" reviews, but it's unclear as to what makes them experts.  They aren't cosmetics chemists, manufacturers, dermatologists, estheticians, or nurses. They ARE marketers for Paula's Choice cosmetics. Paula Begoun sold her private Paula's Choice company to Bertram Capital a few years ago. At that time Marketing got Beautypedia, and Paula became the "face" of the brand.  The products have risen a great deal in price since then, but they are more widely sold. Paula Begoun is one of the most brilliant cosmetics marketers of the 20th and 21st century. Her powerful inverse marketing has caused legions of fans, who have absolutely no idea what they're talking about, to quote Paula's "reviews" as if they are White Papers. Paula Begoun is a marketing genius: first advancing her beauty "bibles", then her privately owned brands for private label cosmetics.  By contrasting her label with ubiquitous brands like Murad and Perricone, people believed her less expensive products were better because they contained ingredients Paula praised in her reviews.  I love the fact that Paula Begoun taught women how to research ingredients, how to look out for what might be personally harmful, and not to believe expensive means great.Beautypedia has begun allowing users to write reviews, which may be an attempt to get people to use the site again.(Which, in turn, directs them to Paula's Choice, of course.)  Many, many of the reviewers disagree with the "expert" reviews, which proves the entirely subjective nature of cosmetics usage, regardless of whether or not evil cosmetics fiends package face creams in jars, or put drops of lavender oil in their concoctions.   Beautypedia's references should be taken with a grain of salt; they often cite in vitro tests, tests on cell cultures (not skin), tests done from product consumption not use on skin, etc. However, if you have any skin diseases, disorders, sensitivities, allergies...this is definitely the place to go before you buy something that may hurt you.  It's easy for people like me, with resistant, genetically strong skin, to think some of the reviews are ridiculous. Without having experienced the constant worry of skin damage and/or irritation, I can say something like "I love Noxzema", and "witch hazel is one of my favorite skin care ingredients." Many people could damage their skin if they think my reviews apply to everyone, so Beautypedia a safe resource for those with sensitive skin.Like the previous reviewer, I am a huge fan of Cosdna.com! :-)      Report Abuse  14 of 17 people found this helpful.         				snowshoe1066 				   on  5/10/2017 8:25:00 PM   More reviews by snowshoe1066     Age: 44-55 Skin: Combination, Fair, Not Sure Hair: Brunette, Wavy, Coarse Eyes: Brown     			While Beautypedia is a massive resource, I do not have 100% faith in their reviews due to their obvious conflict of interest.  Even though Beautypedia claims it's no longer affiliated with Paula's Choice, it's very suspicious that  all the Paula's Choice products are rated 4 stars or higher.  Especially when several of these products have received less than stellar reviews both here and elsewhere on the internet. I'll stick with CosDNA for ingredient analysis, and MakeupAlley for honest reviews.

She makes statements about the "harm" some ingredients may cause, that are debatable at best.  If you would like it broken down for you, just google "Robert Tisserand" and "lavender oil", he breaks it down while still citing references to every claim.  Take all information from Beautypedia with a large grain of salt.

Paula seems to be very reluctant to give some products that seem just fine a satisfactory review due to one little ingredient or formulation defect that really doesn't effect its integrity (which i find annoying) she can be pretty helpful though in pointing out really irritating ingredients in certain products		     Report Abuse  3 of 4 people found this helpful.         				biancaredhead				   on  11/19/2016 8:27:00 AM   More reviews by biancaredhead    Age: 30-35 Skin: Combination, Fair-Medium, Not Sure Hair: Red, Other, Other Eyes: Brown     			Paulas choice uses science to create Their products . I buy the. Acne toner from her line bc it's the only one on the market that does not contain alcohol or witch hazel, birth known to be not god for your skin.  I like that fragrance is always mentioned to be a problem. These companies put fragrance in their products to mask chemical odour and to make the products more appealing. Yes hert products are expensive if you live in Canada but that's only bc of the exchange rate. Years ago it would have been the other way around. Arbonne is rated as bad for the most part, well sure those products are jam packed with irritants. As an example the genius pads. Primarily all alcohol and at that price ??? It's bc the company keeps. Giving Mercedes Benz"'s away so they need to charge a big premium for their products .  They do have a few products I do like though ffrom their makeup line, calm moisturizer and  eye cream . I've tried their protein shakes but again way overpriced. 		     Report Abuse           				ziggymama				   on  4/15/2016 10:46:00 PM   More reviews by ziggymama    Age: 56 & Over Skin: Sensitive, Fair, Neutral Hair: Silver, Curly, Medium Eyes: Grey     			The review by Babs81 just shows that it isn't advisable to trust ANYONE over your own experience. I have extremely picky, sensitive skin. I've used Paula's products for years; some are HG for me (the Skin Recovery Replenishing Moisturizer saved my eyes), some are meh, some my skin won't tolerate...though that's my goofy skin, not necessarily the product. I've been having issues with some seb derm patches the last couple of years, apparently related to menopause (and perhaps overenthusiastic chin plucking). With that, I've had to seek out and use alternative products; when it's irritated and peeling, I must use very bland products; most of Paula's contain too many actives during those periods. Note that despite having great local access, I must order most of these products online (after hours of research and MANY that don't work).I do get annoyed with some of Paula's hobbyhorses, especially the whole sunscreen thing; I'm violently allergic to all chemical sunscreen, and if I used physical sunscreen daily, I'd be broken out all the time (fortunately, I live in Seattle). But I appreciate her attitude about fragrance in products; I can't even use perfume, so...So, this is just to say, if your skin isn't doing well, maybe change it up. I know how hard it can be to figure out what's working and what isn't; let's just say, if your eyes swelled shut when you made an error about cosmetics, wouldn't you be cautious? I learned my lesson early, from allowing people to mess with my face (makeup), and having violent allergic reactions that would then mess up my skin for weeks if not months. I will say, I do love Makeup Alley, spend way too much time here, but it's time well spent! And though it's encouraged my makeup addiction, it's also saved me a lot of money not buying things that sound better than they are.

Ive put off reviewing this for a long time because I didn't want my bitterness to cloud my judgement...its still painful-lol. I discovered one of Paulas "Don't go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me" books and also her Beauty Bible a few years ago. Which quickly led to of course Beautypedia. I was OBSESSED and became a skin care fanatic....started following all her rules to the letter...threw out all my products that didn't receive a GOOD or BEST rating from her-which were almost all of them and as a product hoarder that was a lot of loot wasted. I stopped buying creams in jars. I avoided anything with alcohol in it. I avoided anything without sunscreen included-even make up. I stopped using anything with lavender or even lavender scented even though its one of my favourite smells in the world. I stopped using anything with fragrance even bodywash...which didn't even make sense since I was still wearing perfume on my skin which has fragrance and alcohol (perhaps even lavender lol). Yikes. Anyway...I started making lists of all the things she approved of...which didn't leave me with much to choose from...especially since I live in a very small town with limited places to shop (I pretty much have Shoppers and Walmart). The products she recommended were either her own, expensive or hard to find brands, or maybe a couple Olay products. So I tried Olay...unbeknownst to me at the time-Im allergic to niacinamide which is in all Olay products and most of Paulas. So my skin broke out in a rash which I mistook for pimples. Even more frustrated with my skin care, and out of any other options since she vetoed most products by Neutrogena, Aveeno, Marcelle-my regular brands which actually do work for me-I caved and started ordering her stuff. I spent A LOT of money...especially to have it shipped to Canada and having it converted into US dollars. Her products did not agree with me-at all! Probably due to the niacinamide-I was using her Hydralight line...my face developed hard, painful bumps under the skin, welts you might say, and very hideous redness! May I add this is the summer I got married? With completely ruined skin!Anyhow so perfectly good products thrown out, money wasted on her products, wrecked skin and redness which lasted about a year...this is what I received for my faithful following...However. Why give her site a 3 instead of a one? Because I did learn some very useful information from her site. I learned how to read ingredients lists and what most ingredients actually are, I learned to avoid menthol or menthyl lactate like the damn plague because my skin is allergic to that also but I never made the connection until I read about it being an irritant from her advice. That in itself was priceless, so many face washes contain it and I would always break out in a rash and think it was acne up to that point.So anyway, I check her site from time to time now, mostly out of curiosity...even though I find theyre getting slower and slower adding product reviews-by the time theyre finally reviewed Ive already had the product for months. I went back to using whatever the hell I want, jar packaging, fragrance, lavender, some alcohol...but I always keep her advice in the back of my mind. And now I prefer reading reviews on THIS lovely site!!!

Here are the things I keep reading that make me feel that way.1. "Beautypedia always gives Paulas Choice products the highest ratings"       --Um hello, why would they make any product that wouldn't live up to their 5 star standards?2. "They always push their own products"    --This is mostly true but what company wouldn't do that. Its just business 101. Just because they suggest one of their products over another that is very similar doesn't mean you have to buy it. 3. "They give products I love / work great for me low ratings so they obviously don't know what they are talking about"  --Just because your skin looks plump and smooth overnight (for example) doesn't mean there aren't harmful ingredients in there that aren't harming your skin in other ways long-term. 4: "They give products I love low ratings because of skin irritants / fragrances when they don't irritate my skin"    --A lot of times when they are saying an ingredient is known to be a skin irritant  (such as fragrance, essential oils, etc.) it means it causes oxidation. They make your skin cells decay which you cannot see unless you look under a microscope.5. "Companies must pay them to give their products high ratings"      --If you actually read the reviews and researched the reasons why they gave it a low score you would quickly see that isn't true. 6. "They knock products down just because of their high price"      --All they are doing is saying hey there are other products that do the exact same thing for less or that there isn't anything in the product that justifies the high price. All they are doing is trying to save you money.With all of that being said, if you absolutely love a product that they gave a low score its perfectly fine to keep using it. Just don't knock them down because I have a feeling they know what they are talking about more than the majority of us :)		     Report Abuse           				rachkat				   on  3/30/2016 1:57:00 PM   More reviews by rachkat    Age: 36-43 Skin: Dry, Fair, Cool Hair: Black, Wavy, Fine Eyes: Green     			Interesting notes on her site, I used to read her religiously.  After trying a few of her recommendations, ie. olay, loreal, garnier creams, recently milani eyeshadow that they rave about......my face itched and burned.  Once I became more informed on ingredients, I found alot of her recommendations are highly synthetic or biased based on one ingredient.  I get the feeling she might get kickbacks from alot of these companies, of course I have no proof, but a girl is allowed her thoughts.  I think her 'team experts' aren't really experts, just regular joes working a job.And the one sided.....my stuff is great......I tried several of her products as well, and promptly returned them because they caused itching and burning.  She poopoos alot of products that have worked wonders for my skin, basing her opinion on one ingredient.  ie. Sunday Riley luna oil is bad, I have great alternative retinols, blah blah....granted it's expensive, but it works for me, just not because of the retinols but because of all the other oils in it.  I'm pretty sick of seeing her everywhere, that's why I come here.  :)  although I don't post often.

If she didn't try to push her own product line within a separate product review, I might be able to trust her more. Her team has been wrong about products being discontinued on several occasions and I have corrected them via Twitter. They were kind enough to thank me, but if a consumer can reach out to s brand via social media for accurate information why can't her team keep with database up to date with their direct.connectuons?! I also feel they do not moderate comments fairly. Sometimes they respond with critical rehtoric and other times they ignore symptoms of active ingredients. A specific example involves Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair. Her team tears it apart claiming that the amount of retinol is ineffective but after only three days of use my skin is red, tender and flakey - all side effects of retinol! Some one in the comment section claims they experience flaking and the Paula's Choice team commented that this could be a side effect of the retinol and/or the fragrance. Flaking is a side effect of prescription stregth Retin A which is fragrance free. It appears her team refuses to credit a product with effect ingredients and instead points out its additives. Her own retinol products also cause flaking, that what retinol does and that's a sign that it's working!In order to minimize the negative side effects wait 15 minutes after washing your face before applying a retinoid and apply an additional moisturizer on top afterwards. If you are still sensitive apply an additional layer of moisturizer before applying a retinoid and then apply moisturizer afterwards. These steps are designed to minimize the amount of retinoids absorbed by the skin. Alternate applications or start with only one or two applications a week until you work your way up to every night.

Review: Paula’s Choice Skincare














There are times that I find myself really geeking out about people I get to meet in the beauty world or products that I get to try. This is something my husband doesn’t understand unless I put it in terms of Sports or something similar. A month or so ago I was contacted by Paula’s Choice (The Comsetic Cop author of Don’t Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me) to review some of their products.  I kind of freaked out (in a good way) to my husband and he looked at me like I was kind of a psycho. So I said to him, “it would be like you getting contacted by the Oregon Ducks or the 49ers saying that they had a signed football for you.”  Maybe that is a little dramatic of me to say, but still, I have respected Paula’s opinion on product and ingredients way before I ever ventured into the world of beauty blogging. So I was really excited that they wanted me to review their products on my blog!
With that said, like any skincare review I like to be using the product for a few weeks to see how my skin does, and see what I like or dislike about it.  I have been on these products for over a month so I definitely feel like I got to really “know” them.


Skin Balancing Oil Reducing Cleanser-
What This Is: “A Skin Balancing Oil-Reducing Cleanser is formulated for normal to oily/combination skin and those prone to blemishes.”
How To Use: “Use morning and evening. Splash the face and eyes generously with tepid to slightly warm water. Apply a small amount of cleanser to your face and eye area with vigorous yet gentle circular motions. Rinse well. Repeat or use with a clean washcloth to remove heavy makeup.”
My Experience:  First off, this is one of the largest cleanser bottles I have ever seen which makes for a product that will last you a long time. In addition to that, I really liked how it got off all of my makeup easily, and that I could use it around my eye area without fear of it making me go blind. It also is fragrance free, which is a major plus for me.
Price: $20.36 for a 16oz bottle  (killer value).

Skin Balancing Pore Reducing Toner
What This Is: “A toner that has been specially formulated for normal to oily/combination skin. It is also a good option for acne-prone skin.”
How To Use: “Use morning and evening. After cleansing, apply to a cotton pad and gently stroke over face and neck. Do not rinse.”
My Experience: Honestly, I am not a huge toner person and more times than not, I skip this step. But while using this, my perspective shifted and I have an all new appreciation for them– at least this one anyways. Usually when I use a toner, it strips my skin, making the moisturizing step 1,000 percent essential.  But this one is different because it actually kept my skin moisturized while removing last traces of makeup.
Price: $13.56 6.4 oz
What
Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid
This Is: This is a “2% BHA (salicylic) Liquid Exfoliant rapidly exfoliates both the skin’s surface and inside the pore, reshaping the pore lining, unclogging pores and improving skin cell turnover rate.”
How To Use:  “Can be used once or twice daily after cleansing and toning. You may apply a moisturizer or sunscreen over it as well.”
My Experience: I am kind of a nut when it comes to exfoliating my skin, and I truly don’t think a skin-care regimen is complete unless it has this step. One thing I noticed first when I applied this was the slight tingle sensation, I love that feeling because I know my product is working. After one application, my skin looked more radiant, pores looked tighter, and my skin had a glow. But what really sold  me on this was that the party of  blackheads on my chin started to work their way up and out the door!
Price: $16.96 4 oz

Resist Intensive Wrinkle Repair Retinol Serum
What It Is: “Paula’s Choice RESIST Intensive Wrinkle-Repair Retinol Serum is an exclusive formula that utilizes a proprietary blend of highly stabilized retinol, potent antioxidants, and skin-repairing ingredients. Its soothing, silky texture goes to work immediately to help skin of any age look and act younger. With ongoing use, you will see fewer wrinkles, smoother skin, and improved skin tone.”
How To Use: Apply in the evening after cleansing, toning, and exfoliating. Smooth a few drops onto skin before or after moisturizing.
My Experience: First off,  the twist-open-top packaging on this serum is perfect for my busy lifestyle. It’s very user friendly, and it ensure my product will stay inside the container when not in use.  I am a huge fan of the combination of retinol and an anti-oxident, both essential to my skin-care routine. I enjoyed the texture of this product and the way it covered my entire face and neck with just one pea sized drop. Since using it, I did notice a slight difference around my eyes, it looks more hydrated, and my fine lines look less prominent when I smile.  Although I don’t have a huge issue with fine lines and wrinkles (crossing my fingers and knocking on wood),  I know that the anti-oxidant is a free-radical buster, which will keep my skin in tip-top shape!
Price: $27.16 1 oz (killer deal)

Resist Barrier Repair Moisturizer With Retinol
What It Is: “RESIST Barrier Repair Moisturizer contains a unique complex of ingredients proven to remodel your skin by building and preserving collagen, firming skin and protecting against moisture loss. The feather-light, silky texture provides substantial hydration. The active ingredients in the RESIST Barrier Repair Moisturizer are proven to make a visible difference in the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, skin tone, and skin firmness.”
How To Use: Apply as the very last step in your regimen.
My Experience: I am glad that this was lightweight and not a cream! After using the other steps, just one pump of this was all the additional moisture I needed. And–once again, the retinol is just an added bonus.
Cost: $20.36 1.7 oz (killer deal)
Overall Skincare Experience and Rating
One of the many reasons why I respect “Paula’s Choice,” is because they are up-front with their ingredients and research. You are getting a product formulated by someone who has researched the ins and outs of skincare. To me, it is clear that Paula wants only the very best for your skin. It also doesn’t hurt that these products are really budget friendly while still remaining high in quality.
After a one month trial, there was no weird skin reactions, or break outs. My skin type (normal-combo) did really well, and my skin looks healthy, refreshed, and hydrated.
Rating: I can’t live without you (5 points)
 
xoxo-Kendra

Hello! I could have sworn I’ve been to this site before but after browsing through some of the
post I realized it’s new to me. Anyways, I’m definitely glad I
found it and I’ll be bookmarking and checking back
frequently!






web page



I was recommended this website by my cousin. I am not sure whether this post is written by him as nobody else know such detailed about my trouble.
You’re amazing! Thanks!






www.milanolife.co.jp



Heya superb blog! Does running a blog such as this take a
massive amount work? I have no knowledge of programming however I had
been hoping to start my own blog in the near future. Anyhow, should you have any recommendations or techniques for
new blog owners please share. I understand this is off subject
nevertheless I simply had to ask. Many thanks!






AJ



Great review! I’ve been considering this line, and knowing the toner isn’t drying is a huge plus! But looking at them now, the price on the website has nearly doubled for many of these products, so I’m still on the fence.






Citizens of Beauty



Hi AJ! I think that this skincare line is a great choice…but that is really weird that the pricing has gone up so much. I wonder if they will have a sale soon or something. Thanks for you comment!








Sarah



I was thinking the same thing!  Like how come the prices you listed are so much cheaper.  Sine these products were provided to you for reviews, were these prices provided to you from their rep?  The site routinely have sales of 15-20% off.  I have seen up to 25% sometimes for selected products, but no where as low as yours…especially for the Barrier Repair or the Retinol serum.  Can you reach out to them and ask about this?  Thanks. 






Jeanine



I fought moderate acne for 20 years tried everything RX, obagi , peels, over counter proactive etc etc. Paulas choice has my skin clear for first time in 20 years . If I had known sooner could have alleviated a lot of suffering (and scars!!)
Tell anyone you know who struggles with acne!!

Your Ultimate Defense Against Color Fade
Ultimate Color Repair® harnesses the reparative power of quinoa to lock in hair color, restore luster and reverse the signs of damage. Discovered by the Incas thousands of years ago, quinoa is an ancient grain rich in amino acids that penetrate hair and bond like a magnet, creating a protective shield.

Exclusive KerActive protein “hugs” the hair to help repair damage.



Conditioners and safflower oleosomes deliver rich plant oils to replenish lost moisture and nutrients.



KerActive penetrates the hair shaft to help rebuild, while safflower oleosomes deliver moisture and seal the cuticle.



The result is stronger, healthier hair with long-lasting hydration and shine.










Humble Beginnings
In 1980, two friends were inspired to create a company that would offer luxurious hair care at an affordable price. With just $700, John Paul DeJoria and Paul Mitchell launched a revolutionary hair care system featuring three products. More than 35 years later, Paul Mitchell® offers more than 75 products that are available around the world.

						I love Paula Begoun and her products but I remember her saying that you really shouldn't have to pay more than 25-30 dollars for a one ounce. I just saw she has a one ounce retinol product for 55 dollars. I am sure it is great and maybe even worth it but it just makes me question her a bit. Thoughts?

I've noticed quite often, you can get a comparable product quite a bit less than some of hers.

Her prices have went up over the years but so has the price of a lot of things.  I notice that her products are advertised on a lot of websites now.  I wonder if that has anything to do with it.  Her prices are still competitive but you can find cheaper alternatives for some of them.  I know I was using her Resist Retinol Serum and I do like it but after hearing that it has less retinol than Alpha Hydrox Retinol product, I was a bit shocked.  I've added Retin-a to my routine so I'm not in the market for a Retinol product but if I was, I think I'd try Alpha Hydrox.  It's cheaper and has more Retinol.

I wait for the sales.  I still buy her cleansers because a little goes a long way.  A bottle lasts and lasts, and I'm still getting good results.

Love her Skin Balancing cleanser.  I try other things but always go back to this product.  I agree, a little goes a long way. I keep a smaller bottle in my travel bag that's always pretty much packed and ready to go.

On 7/19/2014 DiscountDiva said: I love Paula Begoun and her products but I remember her saying that you really shouldn't have to pay more than 25-30 dollars for a one ounce. I just saw she has a one ounce retinol product for 55 dollars. I am sure it is great and maybe even worth it but it just makes me question her a bit. Thoughts? I remember this also.  Her products are okay and I've tried a lot of them.  I always go back to other brands.  She has lost credibility with me through the years.

Every since she sold her company in 2012 the prices have gone up and the product line has expanded into some semi-questionable products.  Not what it once was.

Interesting.  Yeah.  I've noticed the gradual price increases and now some products aren't really worth the cost to me when I compare the amount of active ingredient to other brands.  I'll continue with her AHA & BHA.
