Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recently filed Form 10-Q filed today April 26, 2016; Form 10-K, which was filed February 22, 2016 and other public SEC filings. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Ed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Centene's first quarter 2016 earnings call. We are very pleased to have closed the Health Net acquisition within the first quarter as projected. I would like to begin with a few comments on why the addition of Health Net is transformational.In closing the acquisition, Centene has achieved the following: further critical mass including additional product diversification within the government-sponsored healthcare space. We are a $40 billion-plus company. We are the largest Medicaid managed care organizations in the country, serving 6.7 million Medicaid members at March 31.We are the leader in three of the largest Medicaid states; California, Texas and Florida. We are the largest provider of managed long-term support services, one of the fastest-growing segments of the market. We have a 4 Star Medicare Advantage product that can be exploited (3:46) to additional market. And we provide services under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. This greater scale enhances the positive view of Centene nationally as well as by state and local government. It strengthens our ability to help shape sound public health care policy. In addition, it enhances our purchasing power and is beneficial from a balance sheet perspective.Centene is now clearly a large-cap company in stock (4:26). We recently joined the S&P 500 Index. This is important to us as this index is regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Additionally, it will widen our potential investor base and lead to increase liquidity of our stock. Lastly, this acquisition enhances and solidifies the sustainability of Centene's long-term growth rate.I would now like to comment on the timing of the approval process and provide an update on integration. While the regulatory process in California was lengthier than expected, it was fair and the undertakings contained no surprises. We will be making investments in certain state-affiliated investment-grade vehicles as well as in a local service center. The placement of a service center in California is consistent with Centene's local approach.We will work with the state to find a suitable location in an economically-disadvantaged area, where job creation is needed. The investments and charitable contributions associated with these undertakings have been included in our guidance and will be made over a multiple-year period.The planning portion of the integration process was largely completed prior to closing. Our integration team did extensive work to ensure a smooth and seamless combination. We were able to ground running the day of the close and the integration is proceeding as expected.Before I provide first-quarter highlights, I want to remind you that our first quarter results included only eight days of Health Net's financials as the transaction closed on March 24. Our prior guidance had assumed a March 1 close date. We have updated our 2016 guidance to reflect the latest close. This is a timing issue only and we remain confident that our previously-anticipated run rate earnings remain on track.Additionally, we have adjusted our reporting to reflect the increased scale of the business and our new product mix. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors and it will continue to evolve as we complete the Health Net integration.Turning to the first quarter financials, we are pleased with the results of the first quarter. There were many moving parts when combining the two companies, including one-time charges and prorating with timing. Total revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $7 billion. Membership at quarter end was 11.5 million, representing an increase of 7.1 million members or 162% over the first quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 110 basis points year-over-year to 88.7%.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com
