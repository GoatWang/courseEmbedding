FAQs
I. FUNCTION
How does Soundwall work?
Soundwall produces flat-panel speakers made of art that connects with any bluetooth or WiFi-enabled device to stream your favorite music and create a mood with ambient backlighting. We use revolutionary sound technology that vibrates the surface of the aluminum to produce full-range sound from a work of art.
What is the audio quality like from Soundwall?
oundwalls use Distributed Mode Loudspeaker (DML) technology. The entire surface of the art resonates—generating a clear, natural sound. Unlike traditional cone speaker technology, Soundwalls fill an entire room with omni-directional sound that sound great anywhere in the space.
Does Soundwall connect to Sonos?
We do support Sonos and other audio devices. Using a 3.5mm cable, plug one end into the "Audio Out" of your Sonos
and the other end into the “Audio In” on the back of your Soundwall.
How do I stream music to a Soundwall?
You can stream music to your Soundwall via Bluetooth or WiFi.
Can I have a hardwire connection?
Yes you can with a wired aux. You can plug any music source directly into your Soundwall through the Aux port on the
side of the box using a standard 1/8 inch Aux cable like you might use to plug music into your car.
II. TECHNOLOGY
Does Soundwall support Bluetooth?
Yes. Any device that supports Bluetooth audio streaming can stream audio to a Soundwall.
How is Soundwall powered?
Soundwall has a 6ft. Power cord that plugs into your wall. It works with all standard outlets. If you prefer to hide your cord, the power outlet can be moved to be behind the Soundwall.
Can I connect my own subwoofer?
Yes, you can choose any subwoofer you’d like. We recommend Audioengine subwoofers, for their excellent bass
response and sleek design. Just plug the subwoofer into the RCA Analog Output on the back side and you’ll have
added enhanced bass to your Soundwall. We also support the wireless audio transmitter from Dayton Audio. Connect
the Dayton Transmitter device into the back of your Soundwall and the Dayton Receiver into the subwoofer.
