(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Park-Ohio Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "we," "our," or the "Company"). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  We are an industrial Total Supply Management(TM) and diversified manufacturing business, operating in three segments: Supply Technologies, Assembly Components and Engineered Products.  Supply Technologies provides our customers with Total Supply Management(TM), a proactive solutions approach that manages the efficiencies of every aspect of supplying production parts and materials to our customers' manufacturing floor, from strategic planning to program implementation. Total Supply Management(TM) includes such services as engineering and design support, part usage and cost analysis, supplier selection, quality assurance, bar coding, product packaging and tracking, just-in-time and point-of-use delivery, electronic billing services and ongoing technical support. Our Supply Technologies business services customers in the following principal industries: heavy-duty truck; automotive, truck and vehicle parts; power sports and recreational equipment; bus and coaches; electrical distribution and controls; agricultural and construction equipment; consumer electronics; HVAC; lawn and garden; semiconductor equipment; aerospace and defense; and plumbing.  Assembly Components manufactures parts and assemblies and provides value-added design, engineering and assembly services that are incorporated into our customer's end products and oriented toward improving fuel efficiency and reducing weight in the customer's end products. Our product offerings include cast and machined aluminum engine, transmission, brake, suspension and other components, such as pump housings, clutch retainers/pistons, control arms, knuckles, master cylinders, pinion housings, brake calipers, oil pans and flywheel spacers, industrial hose and injected molded rubber and plastic components, gasoline direct injection systems and fuel filler assemblies. Our products are primarily used in the following industries: automotive, including SUV/minivan/light-truck; agricultural; construction; heavy-duty truck; and marine original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), on a sole-source basis.  Engineered Products operates a diverse group of niche manufacturing businesses that design and manufacture a broad range of highly-engineered products including induction heating and melting systems, pipe threading systems, industrial oven systems, and forged and machined products. Engineered Products also produces and provides services and spare parts for the equipment it manufactures. The principal customers of Engineered Products are OEMs, sub-assemblers and end users in the ferrous and non-ferrous metals; silicon; coatings; forging; foundry; heavy-duty truck; construction equipment; automotive; oil and gas; locomotive and rail manufacturing; and aerospace and defense industries.  Sales and segment operating income for these three segments are provided in Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere herein.  Subsequent Events  On April 17, 2017, Park-Ohio Industries, Inc. ("Park-Ohio") the operating subsidiary of Park-Ohio Holdings Corp., completed the issuance of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2027 (the "Notes") and the Company amended its revolving credit and term loan agreements (as amended, the "Further Amended Credit Agreement") . Refer to Note 15 - Subsequent Events for additional discussion of the agreements.  On May 1, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 30, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017 and will result in a cash outlay of approximately $1.6 million.  Table of Contents  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 343.8 $ 328.0 $ 15.8 4.8 % Cost of sales 288.3 280.2 8.1 2.9 % Gross profit 55.5 47.8 7.7 16.1 % Gross margin 16.1 % 14.6 % SG&A expenses 36.6 32.5 4.1 12.6 % SG&A as a percentage of net sales 10.6 % 9.9 % Litigation settlement gain (3.3 ) - (3.3 ) * Asset impairment charge - 4.0 (4.0 ) * Operating income 22.2 11.3 10.9 96.5 % Interest expense 7.4 7.1 0.3 4.2 % Income before income taxes 14.8 4.2 10.6 * Income tax expense 4.7 1.5 3.2 * Net income 10.1 2.7 7.4 * Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.3 ) - (0.3 ) * Net income attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders $ 9.8 $ 2.7 $ 7.1 * Earnings per common share attributable to ParkOhio common shareholders: Basic $ 0.80 $ 0.22 $ 0.58 * Diluted $ 0.79 $ 0.22 $ 0.57 *  * Calculation not meaningful  Net Sales  Net sales increased 4.8%, to $343.8 million in the first three months of 2017, compared to $328.0 million in the same period in 2016, mainly due to higher end market demand for our products in our Supply Technologies and Assembly Components segments and sales from GH Electrotermia S.A. ("GH"), which was acquired in December 2016, all partially offset by lower end market demand in our Engineered Products segment.  The factors explaining the changes in segment net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding 2016 period are contained in the "Segment Results" section below.  Cost of Sales & Gross Profit  Cost of sales increased to $288.3 million in the first three months of 2017, compared to $280.2 million in the same period in 2016. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the increase in net sales in each of our segments.  Gross margin was 16.1% in the first three months of 2017 compared to 14.6% in the same period in 2016. The increase in gross margin was largely due to the profit flow-through from higher sales in the 2017 period; improved product mix; and the favorable impact of cost reduction actions taken in 2016.  Table of Contents  SG&A Expenses  SG&A expenses increased to $36.6 million in the first three months of 2017, compared to $32.5 million in the same period in 2016. SG&A expenses as a percent of sales increased to 10.6% in the first three months of 2017 compared to 9.9% in the first three months of 2016. These increases were primarily due to the SG&A associated with GH.  Litigation Settlement Gain  During the first quarter of 2017, the Company paid $4.0 million to settle the IPSCO litigation. As a result, the Company recognized $3.3 million of income related to the reversal of its excess litigation liability.  Asset Impairment Charge An asset impairment charge of $4.0 million was recognized in the first quarter of 2016 due to the accelerated end of production in certain programs with an automotive customer in our aluminum products business. Interest Expense Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) Interest expense $ 7.4 $ 7.1 Average outstanding borrowings $ 478.0 $ 465.8 Average borrowing rate 6.2 % 6.1 %  Interest expense increased $0.3 million in the first three months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due primarily to higher outstanding borrowings.  Income Tax Expense  The effective income tax rate was 31.8% in the three months ended 2017 compared to 35.7% in the corresponding period of 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in non-deductible items.  Net Income  Net income increased to $10.1 million in the first three months of 2017, compared to $2.7 million in the first three months of 2016, due to the reasons described above.  SEGMENT RESULTS  For purposes of business segment performance measurement, the Company utilizes segment operating income, which is defined as revenues less expenses identifiable to the product lines within each segment. The Company does not allocate items that are non-operating or unusual in nature or are corporate costs, which include but are not limited to executive and share-based compensation and corporate office costs. Segment operating income reconciles to consolidated income before income taxes by deducting corporate costs, certain non-cash items and interest expense.  Table of Contents  Supply Technologies Segment Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 133.2 $ 129.9 Segment operating income $ 11.3 $ 10.2 Segment operating income margin 8.5 % 7.9 %  Net sales increased in the first three months of 2017 compared to the 2016 period due primarily to higher customer demand in the power sports and recreational equipment market, which was up 17%; and the semiconductor market, which was up 61% year-over-year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales in the truck and truck-related market, which was down 17% compared to a year ago. In addition, sales were higher in our fastener business in the 2017 period due to increasing customer demand of our proprietary products.  Segment operating income increased by $1.1 million, and segment operating income margin increased to 8.5% compared to the corresponding 2016 period of 7.9%. These increases were driven by the volume increases noted above.  Assembly Components Segment Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 139.3 $ 131.7 Segment operating income $ 12.5 $ 10.2 Segment operating income margin 9.0 % 7.7 %  Net sales were higher in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period due primarily to higher sales volumes in our fuel filler pipe and fuel rail product lines, driven by new product launches and higher sales outside the U.S. These sales increases more than offset decreased volumes in our aluminum business, which was down due to the accelerated end of production in certain programs in 2016.  Segment operating income in 2017 increased by $2.3 million, and segment operating income margin increased to 9.0% compared to the corresponding 2016 period of 7.7%. These increases were driven by the higher sales levels noted above and the resulting flow-through.  Engineered Products Segment Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 71.3 $ 66.4 Segment operating income $ 1.7 $ 1.4 Segment operating income margin 2.4 % 2.1 %  Net sales were higher in the 2017 period compared to the 2016 period due primarily to sales from our GH acquisition, which was completed in December 2016. Excluding the impact of GH, sales were lower in the 2017 period due to lower customer demand in our induction heating, pipe threading and forging and machined products compared to 2016.  Table of Contents  Segment operating income in 2017 increased by $0.3 million, and segment operating income margin improved to 2.4% compared to 2.1% in the corresponding 2016 period. These increases were driven by the favorable impact of the GH acquisition and cost reduction actions taken in 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the major components of cash flow: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 $ Change Net cash (used) provided by: (In millions) Operating activities $ (0.2 ) $ 10.1 $ (10.3 ) Investing activities (6.1 ) (8.9 ) 2.8 Financing activities 8.8 (3.6 ) 12.4 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 0.7 0.8 (0.1 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 3.2 $ (1.6 ) $ 4.8  Operating Activities  Cash provided by operating activities decreased from the prior year period due to higher working capital needs driven by higher sales levels in 2017, as well as the $4.0 million litigation settlement payment in the first quarter of 2017.  Investing Activities  Investing cash flows in both periods were for purchases of property, plant and equipment to sustain and grow our businesses.  Financing Activities  Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 reflected net borrowings under our revolving credit facility under the Amended Credit Agreement (as described below) to fund higher working capital needs, the litigation settlement payment and our quarterly cash dividend payment. In the first quarter of 2016, net cash used by financing activities reflected debt pay-downs and our quarterly cash dividend, which were both funded by our operating cash flows in the 2016 period.  We do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons.  Liquidity  Our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations, funds available from existing bank credit arrangements and the sale of our debt securities. Our existing financial resources (working capital and available bank borrowing arrangements) and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, including but not limited to our ability to maintain current operations and fund capital expenditure requirements, service our debt, pay dividends, pursue acquisitions, and repurchase shares.  The Company had cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries of $57.9 million at March 31, 2017 and $54.4 million at December 31, 2016. For each of our foreign subsidiaries, we make a determination regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance, if any, available to be repatriated to the United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the foreign subsidiaries' operational activities and/  Table of Contents  or future foreign investments. At March 31, 2017, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States, and it is our current intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although we have no intention to repatriate the approximately $137.0 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of March 31, 2017, if we were to repatriate these earnings, there could potentially be an adverse tax impact.  Senior Notes  On April 7, 2011, we completed the sale of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Senior Notes"). On April 17, 2017, we completed the sale, in a private placement, of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to repay in full the Senior Notes and the Company's term loan under the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below), and to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility under the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below).  Credit Agreement  The Company is a party to a credit and security agreement, dated November 5, 2003, as amended and restated (the "Credit Agreement"), with a group of banks, under which it may borrow or issue standby letters of credit or commercial letters of credit. On July 31, 2014, the Company entered into a sixth amendment and restatement of the credit agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement"), which was further amended on October 24, 2014, January 20, 2015 and March 12, 2015. On April 22, 2016, the Company further amended the Amended Credit Agreement to increase the credit facility from $275.0 million to $300.0 million; increase the inventory advance rate to 65%, which reduces back to 50% on a pro-rata quarterly basis over 36 months commencing July 1, 2016; increase the Canadian sub-limit to $35.0 million; and provide minor pricing adjustments. Please refer to Note 7 - Financing Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. As of March 31, 2017, we had $168.1 million outstanding and $94.9 million of unused borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility provided by the Credit Agreement, which includes the effect of Amendment 6 to the Amended Credit Agreement. Also, as of March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $67.5 million.  On April 17, 2017, the Company entered into the Further Amended Credit Agreement. The Further Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, provides an increased revolving credit facility of up to $350.0 million and extends the maturity date of borrowings under the facility to April 17, 2022. Furthermore, the Company has the option, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, to increase the availability under the revolving credit facility by an aggregate incremental amount up to $100.0 million.  Capital Leases  On August 13, 2015, the Company entered into a Capital Lease Agreement (the "Lease Agreement"). The Lease Agreement provides the Company up to $50.0 million for capital leases. Capital lease obligations of $19.9 million were borrowed under the Lease Agreement to acquire machinery and equipment as of March 31, 2017.  Covenants  The future availability of bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided by the Amended Credit Agreement is based on our ability to meet a debt service ratio covenant, which could be materially impacted by negative economic trends. Failure to meet the debt service ratio covenant could materially impact the availability and interest rate of future borrowings.  At March 31, 2017, our debt service coverage ratio was 2.3, and, therefore, we were in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio covenant in the revolving credit facility provided by the Amended Credit Agreement. The debt service coverage ratio is calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter based on the following ratio: (1) the most recently ended four fiscal quarters of consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Company's Amended Credit Agreement, minus cash taxes paid, minus unfunded capital expenditures, plus cash tax refunds; to  Table of Contents  quarters. We were also in compliance with the other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2017. While we expect to remain in compliance throughout 2017, declines in sales volumes in 2017 could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain of these financial covenants. Additionally, to the extent our customers are adversely affected by declines in the economy in general, they may be unable to pay their accounts payable to us on a timely basis or at all, which could make our accounts receivable ineligible for purposes of the revolving credit facility and could reduce our borrowing base and our ability to borrow under such facility.  Dividends  The Company paid dividends of $1.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. In May 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 30, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 15, 2017 and will result in a cash outlay of approximately $1.6 million. Although we currently intend to pay a quarterly dividend on an ongoing basis, all future dividend declarations will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and dependent upon then-existing conditions, including our operating results and financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Seasonality; Variability of Operating Results  The timing of orders placed by our customers has varied with, among other factors, orders for customers' finished goods, customer production schedules, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. The variability of the level and timing of orders has, from time to time, resulted in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the operations of our businesses. Such variability is particularly evident in our capital equipment business, included in the Engineered Products segment, which typically ships large systems at a relatively lower pace than our other businesses.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our critical accounting policies are described in Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, both contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no new critical accounting policies or updates to existing critical accounting policies as a result of new accounting pronouncements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The application of our critical accounting policies may require management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements.
