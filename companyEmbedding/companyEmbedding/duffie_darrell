 This is a thoroughly updated edition of Dynamic Asset Pricing Theory, the standard text for doctoral students and researchers on the theory of asset pricing and portfolio selection in multiperiod settings under uncertainty. The asset pricing results are based on the three increasingly restrictive assumptions: absence of arbitrage, single-agent optimality, and equilibrium. These results are unified with two key concepts, state prices and martingales. Technicalities are given relatively little emphasis, so as to draw connections between these concepts and to make plain the similarities between discrete and continuous-time models. Readers will be particularly intrigued by this latest edition's most significant new feature: a chapter on corporate securities that offers alternative approaches to the valuation of corporate debt. Also, while much of the continuous-time portion of the theory is based on Brownian motion, this third edition introduces jumps--for example, those associated with Poisson arrivals--in order to accommodate surprise events such as bond defaults. Applications include term-structure models, derivative valuation, and hedging methods. Numerical methods covered include Monte Carlo simulation and finite-difference solutions for partial differential equations. Each chapter provides extensive problem exercises and notes to the literature. A system of appendixes reviews the necessary mathematical concepts. And references have been updated throughout. With this new edition, Dynamic Asset Pricing Theory remains at the head of the field.

Review


"This is an important addition to the set of text/reference books on asset pricing theory. It will, if it has not already, become the standard text for the second Ph.D. course in security markets. Its treatment of contingent claim valuation, in particular, is unrivaled in its breadth and coherence."--Journal of Economic Literature

Matthewson December 23, 2005Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThe mathematics of finance is not trivial, but neither is it really all that difficult; nevertheless, Duffie works to make you think that it is.I maintain a scale of good versus bad mathematics writing in my head, against which I calibrate books I read. This scale stretches from, at one end, the faculty of Moscow University, in particular Israel Gelfand, Vladimir Arnold and Andre Kolmogorov, all of whom manage to explain to me hard things so that they seem easy, to, at the other, Darrell Duffie.Read more22 comments|

It looks like trash.In 2013, paying customers who fork over $60 (USD) for the electronic version of this book deserve more than a crappy HTML-ized version of the printed text where the equations do not scale properly or even line up with the baseline of surrounding text.By flipping through the free sample provided above and comparing it with a copy of the print edition, one can quickly assess just how badly the publisher has wrecked the typesetting of the formulas by converting the text from native PDF to their own proprietary Kindle format. Only certain formats (PDF being foremost among them) can faithfully preserve all of the elegance and beauty that mathematical typesetting systems like LaTeX provide.By refusing to purchase the electronic version, customers can send a strong message to the publisher that they will not accept an inferior product in order to accommodate their desire for digital rights management.The "Kindle Replica" format is a potential solution to this problem as the latter is nothing more than a DRM-wrapped version of PDF.Question to the publisher: why are you not offering a Kindle Replica version of this text, because if you did, I would purchase it immediately.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse1.0 out of 5 starsA waste of timeByA Customeron June 16, 2012Format: HardcoverThis book is at best useful as a reference book but even that is doubtful.If you are new to the subject you will find it very hard to follow. Concepts are often defined purely in math terms with intuition given very sparsely if at all. Proofs are very terse (read incomplete) because everything "is easy to show" and annoyingly often, results are simply stated with the derivation "left as an exercise" leaving me wondering why Duffie uses precious space for those pointless remarks instead of actually explaining the material.If, on the other hand, you already know the material the book might be useful as a reference due to its tersenes. However, I don't see why someone would bother to get used to new notation when they already know the material from somewhere else.As another reviewer already stated, math requirements are quite high: real analysis, stochastic calculus, and measure theory at least and here again I doubt that someone might find the appendices helpful if they don't know the material already from somewhere else.Also, I agree with someone else's comment that while finance can be tough, it is definitely not as tough as Duffie makes it to be. Of course there is always a trade-off between generality and presenting concepts in an easy way but just because something can be done with complex numbers does not mean that it has to.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFinance for economistsByJSon April 27, 2005Format: HardcoverThis book provides the most elegant and coherent synthesis of finance theory, in a complete markets and frictionless settings.For the reader interested in the theoretical foundations of modern financial models, this book has three main advantages over many of its competitors:- It clearly shows the link between modern finance theory and the 40-year old Arrow-Debreu model. As this book will make clear, financial assets can be viewed as "bundles" of Arrow-Debreu contingent goods, and pricing kernels are simply extensions of Arrow-Debreu contingent state prices.- It bridges the gap between arbitrage models on one hand, and models based on consumption, optimization/dynamic programming and general equilibrium on the other hand. Absence of arbitrage guarantees the existence of a stochastic discount factor, or pricing kernel. Optimality implies that the stochastic discount factor must be equal to the investors' intertemporal marginal rate of substitution.- It provides a unified treatment of discrete-time and continuous-time models. Many finance textbooks focus on the mathematic tools and emphasize the difference between continuous-time and discrete-time tools--usually at the expense of the economics underlying both types of models. In contrast Duffie's book emphasizes the conceptual unity between continuous-time and discrete-time asset pricing.This book was written more for students and academics than for pratictioners. It is not a reference or a recipe book for traders and programmers. Several chapters are devoted to general-equilibrium models that pratictioners are not likely to find useful. However, the essentials of derivative asset pricing and the term structure are also covered. The latest edition even includes a chapter on corporate finance.Finally, this book is pretty much self-contained. All the graduate-level math results used in the proofs are presented either in the main body of the book, or in appendices.Read more0Comment|

Why the leverage ratio distorts market-making
Darrell Duffie argues the rule hurts market efficiency for very safe assets

This is the first in a regular series of columns by Darrell Duffie, the Dean Witter distinguished professor of finance at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business. Duffie is also professor by courtesy in the university's economics department. He has recently been an adviser on financial markets to a range of bodies, including the Financial Stability Board and several Federal Reserve banks
Big increases in the capital requirements of bank-affiliated dealers have drained liquidity from over-the-counter markets, especially for products that occupy a lot of space on dealer balance sheets, such as bonds, swaps, repos and foreign exchange contracts.
Dealers have reduced their market-making inventories and are offering less liquid two-way markets for asset classes whose capital requirements have increased significantly.
They have also deployed new financial engineering methods, such as swap compression trading and central clearing, that reduce the amount of balance sheet space required for a given amount of intermediation. To further shrink their balance sheets, dealers have been firing large numbers of less profitable prime-brokerage clients.
In the corporate bond market, dealers are now more likely to offer agency or riskless principal intermediation, which delays the execution of a client's request to sell until the dealer can find a matching buyer. Again, this reduces the amount of balance sheet space required to handle a given amount of trades. Some dealers have simply abandoned their less profitable market-making franchises.
How do we make sense of all this? Although there are many shifting factors at play, the key underlying force is the significant post-crisis increase in Basel III regulatory capital requirements. The benefits of a safer financial system easily dominate the corresponding cost in market liquidity, but a better understanding of this cost could promote some improvements in practice and regulation.
Risk-weighted capital requirements are less distortionary and equally effective in promoting financial stability if set conservatively
There has been a lot of confusion about whether or why capital requirements matter for market liquidity. I have often been asked: if capital requirements matter, wouldn't that be a violation of the Modigliani-Miller (MM) theorem? This famous result states that the total market value of a firm's assets does not depend on the firm's capital structure. Even under its own assumptions, however, MM does not speak to the incentives of a firm to add new positions to its balance sheet. Whenever a dealer adds a new position, even at zero trading profit, the market value of the dealer's equity can be affected by a change in the riskiness of the balance sheet.
For instance, adding a sufficiently risky position, even before considering any trading profit, can benefit a dealer's shareholders at the expense of its creditors, because the limited liability of shareholders allows them to walk away from insolvency at no cost. This leaves creditors with a weaker claim. Economists call this asset substitution. Even if no single trade has a big impact, the incremental effects can add up subtly over time. Capital requirements reduce or block asset-substitution incentives, and encourage a widening of bid-offer spreads.
Higher capital requirements also alter an important incentive known as debt overhang. As first explained by Stewart Myers in 1977, debt overhang implies that a trade with a positive mark-to-market dealer profit can sometimes imply a negative return for the dealer's equity. If the trade requires enough new capital, it may improve the credit quality of the dealer's debt and correspondingly reduce the equity market value associated with limited liability. This is more likely to happen when the additional capital required for the new position is large relative to the riskiness of the position. In effect, this is like asset substitution in reverse.
For example, under the US supplementary leverage ratio rule for the largest US broker-dealers, every $100 million of additional assets requires an additional $5 million of capital, regardless of the risk of the assets. This means that intermediating very safe assets such as US Treasury repos requires a lot of capital relative to the tiny risk involved, and improves the position of creditors.
So, as this capital requirement goes up, repo dealers should increase their bid-ask spreads enough to overcome the debt overhang cost to their shareholders. And that is exactly what they have been doing. Since the imposition of the supplementary leverage ratio rule, bid-ask spreads in the US Treasury repo market have increased from around 3 basis points to more than 16bp. As a consequence, volumes of trade in Treasury repos have dropped precipitously, especially in the interdealer repo market.
In general, dealers best respond to increases in capital requirements by increasing bid-ask spreads for positions that require a lot of regulatory capital relative to their risk, and using financial engineering or new intermediation methodologies to economise on the use of balance sheet space.
Regulators should reconsider the effect of the leverage ratio rule on the efficiency of markets for very safe assets. Risk-weighted capital requirements are less distortionary and equally effective in promoting financial stability if set conservatively.

Description

Product Description

In this book, two of America’s leading economists provide the first integrated treatment of the conceptual, practical, and empirical foundations for credit risk pricing and risk measurement. Masterfully applying theory to practice, Darrell Duffie and Kenneth Singleton model credit risk for the purpose of measuring portfolio risk and pricing defaultable bonds, credit derivatives, and other securities exposed to credit risk. The methodological rigor, scope, and sophistication of their state-of-the-art account is unparalleled, and its singularly in-depth treatment of pricing and credit derivatives further illuminates a problem that has drawn much attention in an era when financial institutions the world over are revising their credit management strategies.
 
Duffie and Singleton offer critical assessments of alternative approaches to credit-risk modeling, while highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current practice. Their approach blends in-depth discussions of the conceptual foundations of modeling with extensive analyses of the empirical properties of such credit-related time series as default probabilities, recoveries, ratings transitions, and yield spreads. Both the “structura” and “reduced-form” approaches to pricing defaultable securities are presented, and their comparative fits to historical data are assessed. The authors also provide a comprehensive treatment of the pricing of credit derivatives, including credit swaps, collateralized debt obligations, credit guarantees, lines of credit, and spread options. Not least, they describe certain enhancements to current pricing and management practices that, they argue, will better position financial institutions for future changes in the financial markets.
Credit Risk is an indispensable resource for risk managers, traders or regulators dealing with financial products with a significant credit risk component, as well as for academic researchers and students.
