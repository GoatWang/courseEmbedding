Materials.











We see opportunity around every corner to help build your community.Sourced from the highest quality sites.
Efficient production for consistency and strength.
Integrated product offering to our customers.
Summit Materials is a vertically integrated construction materials company that produces aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete and asphalt, and offers paving, construction and other services.   These types of products and services touch almost every aspect of your daily life, from the roads you drive to work to the cell phone you use to call home.










Building Materials Fact
Concrete
has been used in some form since Roman times, it is the most universal construction material today.
 











Our Materials.





 

AggregatesAggregates are the building blocks of our nation’s construction industry. These natural resources are the foundation of products and services that develop our public and private infrastructure. The aggregate materials are sourced from our quarries, and are the key materials in production of asphalt, concrete and cement. We stand behind the process and quality from rock to road.
 





 

CementCement, when combined with aggregates and water, produces concrete. Cement is the binder that makes concrete durable, weather resistant and adaptable. Our state of the art cement plant and production process enable our companies and our customers to offer superior concrete products.
 





 

Ready-MixReady-mix is a highly versatile construction material that can be used to make everything from curbs to kitchen counters. Its flexible recipe characteristics allow for an end product that can assume almost any color, shape, texture and strength. Ready-mix concrete can be customized to suit your needs.
 





 

AsphaltAsphalt is one of the most common roadway materials used today; approximately 94 percent of our nation's roads are paved with asphalt. It is formed by the combination of aggregates and liquid asphalt. Asphalt is 100 percent renewable and the U.S. alone recycles nearly 60 million tons of asphalt each year.  
 





 

Paving ConstructionPaving is the final stage of Summit’s vertically integrated product offering. Our companies perform quality work that complements our materials by providing a downstream outlet to distribute these products. Our skilled labor force and quality service offering provide a one stop shop to our customers.
 






Our Process.




Site PlanningA site is chosen to be sustainable throughout and beyond extraction. Before the first stone is removed, we are already planning for the lifecycle of the site.




Safe ExtractionWe partner with our neighbors and our legislators to work responsibly in our environment throughout the extraction process.




Site RepurposingAs the last stone is removed, a site’s lifecycle progresses as it continues to provide communities with varying types of future development.

Share This:TweetShareSummit Materials is a dynamic, fast moving company whose primary focus is to provide innovative solutions to our customer’s needs. Sometimes that means developing a manufacturing process to bring a project into the original budget or inventing a new alloy that allows your product to take over the market.
As we’ve evolved over the years, two main business pillars have emerged as our foundation:

With properties historically viewed as being mutually exclusive, SM-100™ is immune to corrosion while maintaining impressive wear and erosion properties, all while being ultra elastic, non-magnetic, and 18% lighter than steel.  You can call on it when you’ve run out of options and can’t afford a failure. It is routinely used in situations where there is a combination of corrosion and wear issues.


Our Shaped Hot Isostatic Pressed Process (SHIP2) provides a means for creating complex geometries with wrought-processed properties at typical savings of 30%. We provide an attractive alternative to creating wasteful machining chips by vastly improving buy-to-fly ratios.

We’ve worked on projects ranging from golf clubs to the space station and everything in between, so please don’t hesitate to call on us to be part of your team for your next project.
Note that SM-100, Dama-Ti, and SHIP2 are Summit Materials, LLC trademarks.
