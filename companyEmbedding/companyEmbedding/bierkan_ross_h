He was a principal participant with Tom and me in the founding of RLJ Development, LLC and he continued to play a strategic role in our movement towards the creation of RLJ Lodging Trust. Ross is exceptionally prepared as an executive based on his deep knowledge of the hotel industry and the confidence that the Board and management team have in his leadership as CEO of RLJ Lodging Trust. I am convinced that Ross will continue to grow the Company as Tom did with an intense focus on maximizing shareholder value.”
Mr. Bierkan has served as the Company’s Chief Investment Officer since the Company’s formation in 2011 and will continue to serve in that role for the time being.

RLJ Lodging Trust Announces the Appointment of Ross H. Bierkan as 
      President and Chief Executive Officer and Leslie D. Hale as Chief 
      Operating Officer






August 01, 2016 09:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Robert L. Johnson, Executive Chairman of RLJ Lodging Trust (the 
      “Company”) (NYSE:RLJ), today announced that the Board of Trustees (“the 
      Board”) has appointed Ross H. Bierkan as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer (“CEO”) of the Company and Leslie D. Hale as Chief Operating 
      Officer (“COO”) of the Company. In addition, Mr. Bierkan has been 
      elected to the Company’s Board of Trustees.
    


      Mr. Bierkan was initially appointed as interim President and Chief 
      Executive Officer in May 2016 following the departure of Thomas J. 
      Baltimore, Jr. In response to Mr. Bierkan’s appointment, Robert L. 
      Johnson, Executive Chairman of the Company said, “I have known Ross for 
      over 17 years. He was a principal participant with Tom and me in the 
      founding of RLJ Development, LLC and he continued to play a strategic 
      role in our movement towards the creation of RLJ Lodging Trust. Ross is 
      exceptionally prepared as an executive based on his deep knowledge of 
      the hotel industry and the confidence that the Board and management team 
      have in his leadership as CEO of RLJ Lodging Trust. I am convinced that 
      Ross will continue to grow the Company as Tom did with an intense focus 
      on maximizing shareholder value.”
    

      Mr. Bierkan has served as the Company’s Chief Investment Officer since 
      the Company’s formation in 2011 and will continue to serve in that role 
      for the time being. Mr. Bierkan served as a Principal and Executive Vice 
      President of the Company’s predecessor, RLJ Development, LLC, from 2000 
      until the Company’s formation. Previously, Mr. Bierkan was an original 
      member and senior executive of The Plasencia Group, a hospitality 
      transaction and consulting group. Prior to joining The Plasencia Group, 
      Mr. Bierkan worked with Grubb and Ellis Real Estate, a commercial real 
      estate brokerage firm, and held various operational and sales management 
      positions for Guest Quarters Hotels (now the Doubletree Guest Suites).
    

      Ms. Hale will serve in the dual role of Chief Operating Officer and 
      Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of the Company. She will continue to 
      oversee all financial matters, investor relations, and remain 
      significantly involved in the daily operations of the Company. In her 
      dual role, Ms. Hale’s responsibilities will be expanded to include the 
      management of the Company’s operating platform, primarily comprising the 
      Asset Management and Design and Construction functions.
    

      “Leslie, like Ross, has been an integral part of the RLJ success story 
      for over 11 years,” commented Mr. Johnson. “She demonstrated in her role 
      as CFO that she commands the knowledge and expertise needed to develop, 
      execute, and communicate the RLJ Lodging Trust financial strategy. As a 
      result of her efforts, we have created one of the best balance sheets in 
      the lodging REIT sector, while also enhancing the Company’s commitment 
      to transparency and integrity. In her expanded role as COO, I am certain 
      that she will continue to be an invaluable asset to Ross and the entire 
      Company.”
    

      Ms. Hale joined RLJ Development, LLC the Company’s predecessor in 2005 
      as its Director of Real Estate and Finance and was promoted to Vice 
      President in 2006. In 2007, she was promoted to Chief Financial Officer 
      and Senior Vice President and, in 2013, she was promoted to Executive 
      Vice President. Prior to Ms. Hale’s tenure at RLJ, she held several 
      positions within General Electric Capital Corporation (“GE”), including 
      Vice President in the Mergers and Acquisitions Group of GE Commercial 
      Finance and Associate Director in the GE Real Estate – Strategic Capital 
      Group. Before GE, Ms. Hale was an investment banker at Goldman, Sachs & 
      Co.

Forward Looking Statements


Certain statements in this press release, other than purely 
      historical information, including estimates, projections, statements 
      relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating 
      results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are 
      "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private 
      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities 
      Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act 
      of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements generally are 
      identified by the use of the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” 
      “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “will continue,” 
      “intend,” “should,” “may” or similar expressions. Although we believe 
      that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are 
      based upon reasonable assumptions, beliefs and expectations, such 
      forward-looking statements are not predictions of future events or 
      guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ 
      materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Some 
      factors that might cause such a difference include the following: the 
      current global economic uncertainty, increased direct competition, 
      changes in government regulations or accounting rules, changes in local, 
      national and global real estate conditions, declines in the lodging 
      industry, seasonality of the lodging industry, risks related to natural
disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, hostilities, including 
      future terrorist attacks or fear of hostilities that affect travel, our 
      ability to obtain lines of credit or permanent financing on satisfactory 
      terms, changes in interest rates, access to capital through offerings of 
      our common and preferred shares of beneficial interest, or debt, our 
      ability to identify suitable acquisitions, our ability to close on 
      identified acquisitions and integrate those businesses and inaccuracies 
      of our accounting estimates. A discussion of these and other risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ 
      materially from such forward-looking statements is included in "Risk 
      Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
      Condition and Results of Operations" of the Company's Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Given these 
      uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. 
      Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or 
      revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of 
      new information, future events or otherwise.
