TrueBlue Hires Over 30,000 Veterans Per YearAt TrueBlue we believe the training our military veterans receive makes them extraordinary employees. That is why several of our companies are focused on hiring veterans and helping them transition from a military to a civilian career. TrueBlue is a founding member of Hiring our Heroes. For three straight years, PlaneTechs and PeopleScout have earned the Military Friendly Employer designation. PlaneTechs is Ranked #1 by GI Jobs among small to mid-size companies. PeopleScout has also created the Veteran Talent Exchange, connecting veterans to employers committed to their hiring. We don't just talk about our commitment to veteran hiring, we put our muscle behind it with recruiters dedicated to military recruiting.
