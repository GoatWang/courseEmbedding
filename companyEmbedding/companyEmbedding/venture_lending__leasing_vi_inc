ORGANIZATION
AND OPERATIONS OF THE FUND

Venture Lending
& Leasing VI, Inc. (the “Fund”), was incorporated
in Maryland on January 11, 2010 as a nondiversified closed-end
management investment company electing status as a business
development company (“BDC”) under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and is managed by Westech Investment Advisors,
Inc. (“Manager” or “Management”).  One
hundred percent of the stock of the Fund is held by Venture Lending
& Leasing VI, LLC (the “Company”).  Prior to
commencing its operations on June 29, 2010, the Fund had no
operations other than the sale to the Company of 100,000 shares of
common stock, $0.001 par value for $25,000 in January 2010.
 This issuance of stock was a requirement in order to apply
for a finance lender's license from the California Commissioner of
Corporations.

 

In the
Manager's opinion, the accompanying financial statements include
all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)
necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results
of operations.  The interim results for the period ended June
30, 2010 are not necessarily indicative of what the results would
be for a full year.

SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of
Accounting

 

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

Cash and cash
equivalents consist of cash on hand, and money market funds in
banks with maturities of 90 days or less.

 

Interest
Income

 

Interest income
on loans is recognized using the effective interest method
including amounts from the amortization of discounts resulting from
the allocation of amounts ascribed to equity securities received as
part of the loan transaction.  Additionally, fees received as
part of the transaction are added to the loan discount and
amortized over the life of the loan.

 

Valuation
Procedures

 

The Fund
accounts for loans at fair value in accordance with the
“Valuation Methods” below.  All valuations are
determined under the direction of the Manager, in accordance with
this Policy.

 

The
Fund’s loans are valued in connection with the issuance of
its periodic financial statements, the issuance or repurchase of
the Fund’s shares at a price equivalent to the current net
asset value per share, and at such other times as required by law.
 On a quarterly basis, Management will submit to the Board of
Directors (“Board”) a “Valuation Report,”
which details the rationale for the valuation of investments
.

Valuation
Methods

As of June 30,
2010, the financial statements include nonmarketable investments of
$526,186 (or approximately 5% of total assets) with fair values
determined by the Manager in the absence of readily determinable
market values.  Because of the inherent uncertainty of these
valuations, estimated fair values of such investments may differ
significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready
market for the securities existed, and the differences could be
material. Below is the information used by the Manager in making
these estimates.




 

 

  

 

 

 

Fair value is
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
 There is no secondary market for the loans; hence Management
determines fair value based on hypothetical markets.  Venture
loans are generally held to maturity and are recorded at estimated
fair value.  Management determines whether to adjust the
estimated fair value of a loan based on a number of factors,
including but not limited to the borrower’s payment history,
available cash and “burn rate,” revenues, net income or
loss, the likelihood that the borrower will be able to secure
additional financing in the future, as well as an evaluation of the
general interest rate environment.  The amount of any
valuation adjustment is determined based upon a credit analysis of
the borrower and an analysis of the expected recovery from the
borrower, including consideration of factors such as the nature and
quality of the Fund’s security interests in collateral, the
estimated value of the Fund’s collateral, the size of the
loan, and the estimated time that will elapse before the Fund
achieves a recovery.   

Money market
funds held as Cash and Cash Equivalents are valued at their most
recently posted net asset value, if available, or at amortized
cost, provided such amount is not materially different from quoted
price.

Warrants and
Stock

Warrants and
stock that are received in connection with loan transactions
generally will be assigned a fair value at the time of acquisition.
These securities are then distributed by the Fund to the Company at
the assigned value. Warrants are valued based on a modified
Black-Scholes option pricing model which takes into account
underlying stock value, expected term, volatility, and risk-free
interest rate, among other factors.  

Nonaccrual
Loans

The
Fund’s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when
the loan stops performing and Management deems that it is uncertain
that the loan will return to performing status.  When a loan
is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest previously accrued but
not collected is reversed for the quarter in which the loan was
placed on nonaccrual status.  Any uncollected interest related
to quarters prior to when the loan was placed on nonaccrual status
is added to the principal balance, and the aggregate balance of the
principal and interest is evaluated in accordance with the policy
for valuation of loans in determining Management’s best
estimate of fair value.

No loans were
classified as non-accrual as of June 30, 2010.

Commitment
Fees

Unearned income
and commitment fees on loans are recognized using the effective
interest method over the term of the loan. Commitment fees are
carried as liabilities when received for commitments upon which no
draws have been made. When the first draw is made, the fee is
treated as unearned income and is recognized as described above.
 If a draw is never made, the commitment fee less any
applicable legal costs becomes recognized as other income after the
commitment expires.

Credit Risks
 

 

Most of the
companies with which the Fund enters into financing transactions
have not achieved profitability, experience substantial
fluctuations in their operating results or, in some cases, do not
have significant operating revenues.  The ability of these
companies to meet their obligations to the Fund, therefore, depends
to a significant extent on the willingness of a borrower's equity
venture capital investors or outside investors to provide
additional equity financing, which in turn depends on the
borrower's success in meeting its business plan, the market climate
for venture capital investments generally and many other factors.
 The companies to which the Fund provides financing frequently
engage in the development of new products or technologies, and the
success of these efforts, or the ability of the companies to
successfully manufacture or market products or technologies
developed, cannot be assured.  These companies frequently face
intense competition, including competition from companies with
greater resources, and may face risks of product or technological
obsolescence, non-acceptance in the market, or rapidly changing
regulatory environments, any of which could adversely affect their
prospects.  The success of such companies often depends on the
management talents and efforts of one person or small group of
persons whose death, disability or resignation would adversely
affect the company.




 

 

  

 

 


Emerging Company Risks  

 

The possibility
that the companies in which the Fund invests will not be able to
commercialize their technology or product concept presents
significant risk to the Fund.  Additionally, although some of
such companies may already have a commercially successful product
or product line at the time of investment, technology products and
services often have a more limited market or life span than
products in other industries.  Thus, the ultimate success of
these companies may depend on their ability to continually innovate
in increasingly competitive markets.  Most of the companies in
which the Fund invests will require substantial additional equity
financing to satisfy their continuing growth and working capital
requirements.  Each round of venture financing is typically
intended to provide a company with enough capital to reach the next
stage of development.  The circumstances or market conditions
under which such companies will seek additional capital is
unpredictable.  It is possible that one or more of such
companies will not be able to raise additional financing or may be
able to do so only at a price or on terms which are
unfavorable.

 

Challenges
in Financial Markets  

 

The ability of
the Fund to provide an acceptable return may be adversely affected
by economic factors to which the marketplace is subject.
 Volatility in the global financial markets reached
unprecedented levels during the past few years, and these
conditions may continue into the near future. The Fund’s
estimates of fair value are based on the best information available
to the Manager as of the date of valuation. Restrictions on the
availability of financing as well as the current economic
environment have resulted in a low volume of purchase and sale
transactions, limiting the number of observable input available to
Management in making their estimates of fair value. This market
turmoil could have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
business and operations. Market turmoil could impact the
Fund’s ability to secure a debt facility at terms acceptable
to the Fund.  Should the Fund not be able to secure a facility
of the size it seeks, the Fund’s ability to utilize leverage
to maximize the return it achieves on investments will be impaired.
  

Market
conditions could also adversely impact the ability of the
Fund’s borrowers to meet their obligations to the Fund and
the value of the Fund’s direct investments in companies.
 Most of the companies in which the Fund invests have not
achieved profitability and require substantial equity financing to
satisfy their continuing growth and working capital requirements.
 The economic downturn could decrease the demand for such
borrower’s products and technology, thereby impairing such
borrower’s financial condition and ability to raise
additional equity financing from outside investors.  This
could result in an increase in borrower defaults under their
obligations to the Fund, or a decrease in the value of the
Fund’s direct equity investments.  U.S. and global
economic conditions could continue to deteriorate and remain weak
for an extended period of time. Additionally, it is possible that
market conditions could decrease the demand for venture
loans.

 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In January
2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06
(“ASU 2010-06”), Improving Disclosures about Fair
Value Measurements , which, among other things, amends ASC 820
to require entities to separately present purchases, sales,
issuances, and settlements in their reconciliation of Level 3 fair
value measurements (i.e., to present such items on a gross basis
rather than on a net basis), and which clarifies existing
disclosure requirements provided by ASC 820  regarding the
level of disaggregation and the inputs and valuation techniques
used to measure fair value for measurements that fall within either
Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  ASU 2010-06
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases,
sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity
in Level 3 fair value measurements (which are effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods
within those fiscal years).  The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did
not have a material impact on the Fund’s financial
statements.  Certain parts of the ASU 2010-06 are not yet
effective.  Management is currently assessing the impact that
the adoption of ASU 2010-06 will have on the Fund’s financial
statement disclosures.




 

 

  

 

 

Tax
Status

The Fund plans
on qualifying as a Regulated Investment Company (“RIC”)
and is planning on electing RIC treatment when it files its tax
return in 2011.  As long as the Fund qualifies as a RIC, it
will not pay any federal or state corporate income tax on income
that is distributed to its shareholder (pass-through status).
 Should the Fund not qualify as a RIC or lose its
qualification as a RIC, it could be taxed as an ordinary
corporation on its taxable income for that year (even if that
income is distributed to its shareholder), and all distributions
out of its earnings and profits will be taxable to its shareholder
as ordinary income.  As of June 30, 2010 the Fund had no
uncertain tax positions.

SUMMARY OF
INVESTMENTS

 

Loans generally
are made to borrowers pursuant to commitments whereby the Fund
agrees to finance assets and/or provide working or growth capital
up to a specified amount for the term of the commitments, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions specified by such commitment.
As of June 30, 2010, the Fund's investments in loans are primarily
to companies based within the United States and are diversified
among borrowers in the industry segments shown below.  The
percentage of net assets that each industry group represents is
shown with the industry totals below  (the sum of the
percentages does not equal 100 percent because the percentages are
based on net assets as opposed to total loans).  

 

The Fund
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date; that is, an
exit price. The exit price assumes the asset or liability was
exchanged in an orderly transaction; it was not a forced
liquidation or distressed sale.

 

Loan balances
are summarized by borrower.  Typically a borrower's balance
will be composed of several loans drawn under a commitment made by
the Fund with the interest rate on each loan fixed at the time each
loan is funded. Each loan drawn under a commitment may have a
different maturity date and amount.     For the period from
June 29, 2010, commencement of operations, through June 30, 2010,
the weighted-average interest rate on the performing loan was
22.51%.  Interest is calculated using the effective interest
method, and rates earned by the Fund will fluctuate based on many
factors including volatility, early payoffs, and recovery of
interest from non-performing assets.

Valuation
Hierarchy

 

The Fund
categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level
hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used by the
Fund’s valuation techniques. A level is assigned to each fair
value measurement based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as
follows:




 

 

  

 

 

 





 



 



 





Level
1



 



Unadjusted
quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets
that are accessible at the measurement date.





Level
2



 



Prices or
valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets and liabilities.





Level
3



 



Prices or
valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the
fair value measurement and unobservable.




 

The
Fund’s cash equivalents were valued at the net asset value of
the money market fund. As a result, these measurements are
classified as Level 1. The Fund uses estimated exit values when
determining the value of its investments.  Because these
transactions are individually negotiated and unique, and there is
no market in which these assets trade, the inputs for these assets,
which are discussed in the Valuation Methods listed above, are
classified as Level 3.  

 

The following
table presents the balances of assets as of June 30, 2010 measured
at fair value on a recurring basis:

EARNINGS PER
SHARE

Basic earnings
per share are computed by dividing net decrease in net assets
resulting from operations by the weighted average common shares
outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share are computed by
dividing net decrease in net assets resulting from operations by
the weighted average common shares outstanding, including the
dilutive effects of potential common shares (e.g., stock options).
 The Fund has no instruments that would be potential common
shares; thus, reported basic and diluted earnings per share are the
same.

MANAGEMENT
AND RELATED PARTIES

Management
Fees

As compensation
for its services to the Fund, the Manager receives a management fee
(“Management Fee”) computed and paid at the end of each
quarter at an annual rate of 2.5 percent of the Company’s
committed equity capital (regardless of when or if the capital is
called) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter in a two-year
period commencing with the first capital closing, which took place
on June 29, 2010.  Following this two-year period, Management
Fees are calculated and paid at the end of each quarter at an
annual rate of 2.5 percent of the Fund’s total assets
(including amounts derived from borrowed funds) as of the last day
of each quarter.  Management Fees of $29,394 were recognized
as expenses for the period ended June 30, 2010. 

Related
Parties

Certain
officers and directors of the Company also serve as officers and
directors of the Manager.  The Articles of Incorporation of
the Fund provide for indemnification of directors, officers,
employees, and agents (including the Manager) of the Fund to the
full extent permitted by applicable state law and the 1940 Act,
including the advance of expenses and reasonable counsel fees.
 The Articles of Incorporation of the Fund also contain a
provision eliminating personal liability of a Fund director or
officer to the Fund or its shareholder for monetary damages for
certain breaches of their duty of care. For this reason, the Fund
has acquired a directors & officers insurance
policy.

 

Transactions with Venture
Lending & Leasing V, Inc. (“ Fund
V”)  

 

The Manager
also serves as investment manager for Fund V.  The
Fund’s Board of Directors determined that so long as Fund V
has capital available to invest in loan transactions with final
maturities earlier than December 31, 2015 (the date on which Fund V
will be dissolved), the Fund will invest in each portfolio company
in which Fund V invests (“Investments”).
 Initially the amount of each Investment has been allocated
50% to the Fund and 50% to Fund V so long as Fund V has capital
available to invest.  This percentage may be changed after the
final close of capital at which time a determination of the
percentage allocation will be made. After February 2011, Fund V no
longer is permitted to enter into new commitments to borrowers;
however, Fund V will be permitted to fund existing commitments.
 While investing the Fund’s capital in the same
companies in which Fund V is also investing could provide the Fund
with greater diversification and access to larger transactions, it
could also result in a slower pace of investment than would be the
case if the Fund were investing in companies by itself.
 

 

Although the
Fund and Fund V intend to invest in the same companies in the
manner described above, the Fund may, at any time, with the
approval of its Board of Directors, (i) discontinue investing with
Fund V with respect to any or all future investments or (ii) choose
to invest in different proportions with Fund V than described
above.  In addition, the Fund has no control over Fund V,
which is not required to invest with the Fund in any particular
proportion or at all, and may choose to discontinue investing with
the Fund or to invest in different proportions than described in
the preceding paragraph.  In the event that Fund V and the
Fund invest other than in the pro rata manner described above
(which can occur only with each Board of Directors approval), the
Manager may have a conflict of interest in determining which of
Fund V and the Fund will invest in a particular company and, if
both, in what proportions.  The Fund may also engage in loan
transactions with, or make equity investments in, companies that
are preexisting borrowers from Fund V or its predecessor
funds.

 

To the extent
that clients, other than Fund V, advised by the Manager (but in
which the Manager has no proprietary interest) invest in
opportunities available to the Fund, the Manager will allocate such
opportunities among the Fund and such other clients in a manner
deemed fair and equitable considering all of the circumstances in
accordance with procedures approved by the Fund’s Board of
Directors (including a majority of the disinterested
directors).


Intercreditor Agreements  

In each
transaction in which both the Fund and Fund V invest, it is
expected that the Fund and Fund V will enter




 

 

  

 

 

into an
intercreditor agreement pursuant to which the Fund and Fund V will
cooperate in pursuing their remedies following a default by the
common borrower.  Generally, under such intercreditor
agreements, each party would agree that its security interest would
be treated in parity with the security interest of the other party,
regardless of which security interest would have priority under
applicable law.  Accordingly, proceeds realized from the sale
of any collateral or the exercise of any other creditor’s
rights will be allocated between the Fund and Fund V pro rata in
accordance with the amounts of their respective investments.
 An exception to the foregoing arrangement would occur in
situations where, for example, one of the lenders financed specific
items of equipment collateral; in that case, usually the lender who
financed the specific assets will have a senior lien on that asset,
and the other lender will have a junior priority lien (even though
they may ratably share liens of equal priority on other assets of
the common borrower).  As a result of such intercreditor
agreements, the Fund may have less flexibility in pursuing its
remedies following a default than it would have had there been no
intercreditor agreement, and the Fund may realize fewer proceeds.
 In addition, because the Fund and Fund V invest at the same
time in the same borrower, such borrower would be required to
service two loans rather than one.  Any additional
administrative costs or burdens resulting there from may make the
Fund a less attractive lender, and may make it more difficult for
the Fund to acquire such loans.

CAPITAL
STOCK

As of June 30,
2010, there were 10,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value
common stock authorized, and 100,000 shares issued and
outstanding.  Total committed capital of the Company, as of
June 30, 2010 is $214.6 million.  Total contributed capital to
the Company through June 30, 2010 was $16.1 million, of which $10.0
million was contributed to the Fund.  Subsequent to
quarter-end, additional commitments of capital to the Company in
the amount of $79.4 million were received (See Note 8).

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
require disclosure of financial highlights of the Fund for the
periods presented.  The total rate of return is defined as the
return based on the change in value during the period of a
theoretical investment made at the beginning of the period.
 The total rate of return assumes a constant rate of return
for the Fund during the period reported and weights each cash flow
by the amount of time held in the Fund.  This required
methodology differs from an internal rate of return.

The ratios of
expenses and net investment income to average net assets,
calculated below, are not annualized and are computed based upon
the aggregate weighted average net assets of the Fund for the
periods presented.  Net investment income is inclusive of all
investment income net of expenses, and excludes realized or
unrealized gains and losses.




 

 

  

 

 

Beginning and
ending net asset values per share are based on the beginning and
ending number of shares outstanding.  Other per share
information is calculated based upon the aggregate weighted average
net assets of the Fund for the periods presented.

The following
per share data and ratios have been derived from the information
provided in the financial statements.

variances in the actual versus projected growth in assets, return

Overview

 

The Fund is a
financial services company primarily providing financing and
advisory services to a variety of carefully selected venture-backed
companies primarily located throughout the United States with a
focus on growth oriented companies.  The Fund’s
portfolio is expected to become well diversified and consists of
companies in the communications, information services, media, and
technology, including software and technology-enabled business
services, bio-technology, and medical devices industry sectors,
among others.  The Fund’s capital is generally used by
our portfolio companies to finance acquisitions of fixed assets
and/or for working capital.  On June 29, 2010, the Fund
completed its first closing of capital, made its first investments,
and became a non-diversified, closed-end investment company that
elected to be treated as a business development company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.  The Fund intends to elect to
be treated for federal income tax purposes as a regulated
investment company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue
Code with the filing of its federal corporate income tax return for
either 2010 or 2011.  Pursuant to this election, the Fund
generally will not have to pay corporate-level taxes on any income
it distributes to the stockholder as dividends, allowing the
Fund’s shareholder to substantially reduce or eliminate its
corporate-level tax liability.

 

The Fund will
seek to meet the ongoing requirements, including the
diversification requirements, to qualify as a RIC under the
Internal Revenue Code.  If the Fund fails to meet these
requirements, it will be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its
taxable income for that year (even if that income is distributed to
the Company) and all distributions out of its earnings and profits
will be taxable to the Members of the Company as ordinary income;
thus, such income will be subject to a double layer of tax.
 There is no assurance that the Fund will meet the ongoing
requirements to qualify as a RIC for tax purposes.




 

 

  

 

 

 

The Fund's
investment objective is to achieve a superior risk adjusted
investment returns.  The Fund seeks to achieve its investment
objective by providing debt financing to portfolio companies.
 Since inception, the Fund's investing activities have focused
primarily on private debt securities.  The Fund generally
receives warrants to acquire equity securities in connection with
its portfolio investments.  The Fund generally distributes
these warrants to its shareholder upon receipt.  The Fund also
has guidelines for the percentages of total assets which will be
invested in different types of assets.

 

The portfolio
investments of the Fund will primarily consist of debt financing to
venture capital backed technology companies.  The
borrower’s ability to repay its loans may be adversely
impacted by a number of factors, and as a result, the loan may not
fully be repaid.  Furthermore, the Fund’s security
interest in any collateral over the borrower’s assets may be
insufficient to make up any shortfall in payments.

 

Critical
Accounting Policies

We identified
the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial
statements depend and determined the critical accounting principles
by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or
subjective decisions or assessments.  The two critical
accounting policies relate to the valuation of loans and treatment
of non-accrual loans.  

 

Loans are held
at estimated fair value as determined by Management, in accordance
with the valuation methods described in the valuation of loans
section of Note 2 of the Fund’s financial statements (Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies).  Critical factors in
determining the fair value of a loan include payment history,
collateral position, financial strength of the borrower, prospects
for the borrower's raising future equity rounds, likelihood of sale
or acquisition of the borrower, and length of expected holding
period of the loan, as well as an evaluation of the general
interest rate environment.  The actual value of the loans may
differ from Management's estimates which would affect net income as
well as assets.

non-performing assets (if any).
