Welcome to EnQuest


EnQuest is an oil and gas development and production company focused on turning opportunities into value by targeting maturing assets and undeveloped oil fields.

EnQuest is one of the largest UK independent oil producers in the UK North Sea and has a presence in Malaysia. EnQuest’s assets include producing oil fields, new developments and a portfolio of discoveries.


            Vision and Strategy
            






                  EnQuest’s 2016 Full Year Results 
                
EnQuest’ CEO Amjad Bseisu said:
“EnQuest further streamlined its operations in 2016 and delivered cash capital expenditure at $609 million and unit opex at $24.6/bbl, both well down on the previous year. Operationally EnQuest worked at high levels of production efficiency and safely delivered production averaging 39,751 Boepd, our highest annual production figure, supporting our financial objectives.

2016 saw the successful restructuring of our balance sheet, designed to strengthen EnQuest’s liquidity position, to reduce the level of its cash debt service obligations and to enable it to bring the Kraken development onstream.

In early 2017, EnQuest securely moored the Kraken FPSO on station in the North Sea, where commissioning work continues on the vessel and the subsea infrastructure; preparations for the handover to operations are ongoing. The project remains below budget and on track to deliver first oil in Q2 2017.

In early 2017, EnQuest and BP announced EnQuest’s proposed acquisition of interests in the Magnus oil field and the Sullom Voe oil terminal. The innovative structure of the acquisition recognises EnQuest’s differential strength in managing maturing assets and infrastructure, whilst generating significant potential for future growth.

EnQuest’s combination of integrated technical capabilities and high levels of production efficiency and cost control ideally positions us to create value from assets such as Magnus and from the substantial potential in our existing asset portfolio, with 215 MMboe of net 2P reserves at the end of 2016. Our journey to optimise and increase production and reduce costs continues, with average 2017 production anticipated to be between 45,000 Boepd and 51,000 Boepd. Following delivery of Kraken, EnQuest will begin moving from a period of heavy capital investment into one focused on cash generation and deleveraging the balance sheet.”
As at 21 March 2017

About 


											EnQuest is an oil and gas development and production company focused on turning opportunities into value by targeting maturing assets and undeveloped oil fields.

EnQuest intends to deliver sustainable growth by focusing on exploiting its existing reserves, commercialising and developing discoveries, converting contingent resources into reserves and pursuing selective acquisitions.

We believe that EnQuest has the right mix of capabilities for its business model, which is focused on development and production opportunities in maturing basins, which are not material enough for major oil companies.

Through its proven skills as an oil field operator, EnQuest delivers industry leading levels of production efficiency and of cost control, creating opportunities for it to add value to the assets it manages. EnQuest has the full spectrum of integrated technical capabilities needed to deliver new oil field developments successfully; combining subsurface, facilities planning and drilling. EnQuest has substantial operational scale.

EnQuest is the largest UK independent oil producer in the UK North Sea.  EnQuest’s assets include producing oil fields, major new developments and a portfolio of discoveries.  EnQuest is  also building a presence in oil basins outside the UK North Sea, with substantial production from Malaysia.
