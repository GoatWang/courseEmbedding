In an ever-changing retail environment we must constantly be on the watch for changes in consumer tastes and look to capitalize on new trends. We were the first to successfully introduce nutraceutically-enhanced beverages into Canada and the first to employ new small bottle hot-fill PET technology.
      By combining the resources of our in-house Research and Development Department with some of the world’s best packaging and flavor design companies, we are able to turn a concept into finished product in under six weeks.
Most of our competitors require three times that long. We are also able to quickly adapt foreign products to comply with unique Canadian labeling and content requirements. This gives us a distinct advantage in bringing the successes of other countries to Canada.
