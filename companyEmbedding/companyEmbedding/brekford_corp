Automated Traffic Safety Solutions | Brekford

      Automated Traffic Safety Solutions    


Public safety is a major concern for most communities – especially as populations grow, public safety budgets are reduced. One way to help make streets safer while reducing workload is a well-run automated photo red light or photo speed enforcement program. The objective of automated safety enforcement is to help curtail aggressive driving through voluntary compliance. Revenue generated from fines routinely goes directly back into supporting other public safety initiatives.
Although opponents of red light cameras cite the increase in rear end collisions as cause for disapproval of cameras, a study conducted in February 2011 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (the “IIHS”) reported that red-light cameras reduced fatal red light running crashes by 24% in 14 large U.S. cities with populations over 200,000. IIHS concluded that if red light cameras had been operating in all 99 U.S. cities with populations over 200,000 during this study period (five years), a total of 815 deaths could have been avoided. Because the types of crashes prevented by red light cameras tend to be far more severe than rear-end crashes, research has shown there is a positive aggregate benefit. Photo Enforcement solutions can reduce collisions, injuries and deaths by providing a useful tool for municipalities and law enforcement agencies, without unduly taxing drivers who do not break the law. Today, more than 600 communities across the U.S. operate red light or speed camera enforcement programs.

Regardless of the increased safety effects and prevention of fatalities, there is still a common misconception that automated traffic safety enforcement systems are not supported by the general public. An IIHS survey conducted in November, 2012 found that a large majority of people living in Washington, D.C., one of the largest combined red light and speed enforcement programs in the U.S., favor camera enforcement. Of those surveyed, 87% support red light cameras and 76% support speed cameras. Even the majority of violators (59%) agreed that they deserved their most recent citation.
Brekford’s automated traffic safety enforcement (“ATSE”) products offer intersection safety (red light), photo speed, work zone and school bus enforcement options by way of a complete suite of solution-based products. By assembling a team of industry professionals with the most experience in this field, we have developed equipment and a full turn-key solution that we believe will ensure the success of any program. Having the advantage of a team with experience, we have created and implemented some of the most cutting-edge features into our design – while constructing end-to-end systems specifically with our clients’ needs in mind.

Brekford Corp. sells part of its business in anticipation of merger




Brekford Corp., which sells red light and speed cameras and other systems to public agencies throughout the country, is spinning off its vehicle services business in anticipation of a merger.Columbia-based LB&B will take an 80 percent stake in Brekford's law enforcement "vehicle upfitting business" — installing special equipment such as skid pads — which has been concentrated in a new limited liability company called Global Public Safety LLC. LB&B is paying $4 million in cash and contributing a $2 million promissory note.The deal is expected to close Feb. 28.Proceeds will be used to pay off Brekford's debt and expand its automated traffic safety products, such as its red light and speed cameras, the company said Monday in a news release.

Brekford, headquartered in Hanover, reported about $800,000 in losses in the first nine months of the year.In December the company said it was planning to merge with a bigger company in Virginia, Keystone Solutions Corp. A sale of the vehicle services business was part of that plan, which is expected to close later this year.

              'Things like this will kill this program!' police sergeant wrote (Scott Calvert and Luke Broadwater, The Baltimore Sun)

LB&B Associates Inc. employs more than 1,000 people and provides logistics support, facilities management and maintenance to the U.S. military, federal agencies, state government and businesses around the world.Brekford is known in Baltimore for taking over Baltimore's troubled red light and speed camera program from an earlier contractor. But the program never got off the ground. The city said in 2013 it would pay to end the contract early.nsherman@baltsun.com

(OTCQX: BFDI) Announce Terms for Proposed MergerAccesswireDecember 7, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareMerger Would Allow Combined Companies to Grow Existing Business Through Access to Additional Capital, Sales and Distribution ResourcesCHANTILLY, VA / ACCESSWIRE / December 7, 2016 / KeyStone Solutions, Inc. ("KeyStone"), a company whose subsidiaries presently serve the government contracting sector, announced today that it has entered into a non-binding letter of intent ("LOI") to combine with Brekford Corp. (BFDI) ("Brekford"). KeyStone is focused on building end-to-end solutions for its clients through both acquisitive and organic means. Brekford is a public company that delivers public safety technology and turnkey automated traffic safety solutions to federal, state and municipal audiences. KeyStone management believes that through sales, partnering, expanding distribution and strategic direction, it can create value for the combined entity's shareholders. The LOI contains an exclusivity provision through March 31, 2017 during which time Brekford has agreed they will not solicit, negotiate, or accept any third-party proposals regarding the acquisition of Brekford, any merger or consolidation with or involving Brekford, or any other "Competing Transaction" (as defined in the LOI) of Brekford, except for the sale of Brekford's vehicle upfitting business. The proposed transaction is conditioned on the sale by Brekford of not more than 81% of its vehicle upfitting business to a company with the resources to grow that business unit to a national footprint, with the terms of such sale to be approved by KeyStone.The LOI contemplates a consolidation in which KeyStone and Brekford would merge with two separate wholly owned merger subsidiaries of a newly formed publicly traded holding company, with KeyStone and Brekford surviving as wholly owned subsidiaries of that new holding company. If the mergers were consummated as planned, shares in KeyStone and Brekford would be exchanged for shares in the new holding company, resulting in KeyStone and Brekford becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of the holding company. The foregoing share exchanges would be accomplished pursuant to an effective Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The parties expect that the consolidation would result in KeyStone stockholders and Brekford stockholders holding approximately 80% and 20%, respectively, of the new holding company's shares on a fully diluted basis upon the closing of the combination. The LOI requires that the parties work exclusively together to complete definitive agreements by January 31, 2017, with a view toward closing on the combination by the end of the first quarter of 2017.KeyStone previously announced its intended acquisition of Firestorm Solutions, LLC (http://keystonewins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/U-1-2016.11.21-Final-Firestorm.pdf). KeyStone intends to leverage the Firestorm network of principals and locations to expand Brekford's product distribution to municipalities and government agencies. A combination of the three companies, should it occur, would allow Brekford to increase sales in its two core service areas, upfitting for public safety vehicles and automated traffic safety enforcement. KeyStone management believes that through the use of additional capital, strategic relationships, and broadened distribution, the combined entity will grow beyond Brekford's existing markets. The boards of KeyStone and Brekford believe the resulting entity will create greater opportunities for shareholder value."The combination of KeyStone, Brekford and Firestorm will allow the shareholders to enjoy the benefits of an entity that gains greater market share in the government contracting space. With the federal government spending an estimated $430-500 billion annually procuring products and services, we feel this market is stable, unlikely to shrink and has a strong need for innovative products and services such as those provided by our subsidiaries," said KeyStone Solutions CEO Robert A. Berman.Upon closing of the consolidation, Robert A. Berman is expected to become CEO of the combined entity."Brekford is excited to complete this combination with Keystone and Firestorm, which we believe will provide increased value to our shareholders and customers on multiple fronts. We intend to offer our turnkey automated photo enforcement services much more broadly throughout the United States, utilizing a force multiplier effect with Firestorm's business development network. Additionally, we are confident that customers will continue to benefit from our foundation as a public safety solutions provider, as we seek to identify the appropriate buyer for our public safety vehicle services business," said Rod Hillman, Brekford Corp. President and COO.Read MoreThe LOI is non-binding and any agreement is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive transaction agreement, which may vary from the terms set forth in the LOI. A final transaction also is anticipated to be subject to material conditions, including, but not limited to: (i) the approval of the respective boards of directors and shareholders of KeyStone and Brekford; (ii) the filing with, and declaration of effectiveness by the SEC, of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 with respect to the combination; and (iii) other customary conditions for a transaction of this nature. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be reached by the companies, or that any agreement will result in the completion of a combination.About KeyStoneKeyStone Solutions is a holding company headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia that was formed in 2016 to provide end-to-end services to government contractors from its subsidiary companies.
