       FAQs regarding your Century Bank Debit MasterCard
    

Q: What�s the difference between selecting �Debit� or �Credit�?


       A: With �Debit,� you enter your Personal Identification Number (PIN). With �Credit,� you don�t, which makes the transaction that much safer. Either way the money is taken directly out of your checking account.
    

Q: But if I press or say �credit,� does that make it a credit card transaction?


       A: No. With your Century Bank Debit MasterCard, the money comes out of your checking account.
    

Q: How can I get cash?


       A: Ask the merchant if �Cash Back� is a service they provide. Or get cash at a Century Bank ATM and at more than 1 million ATMs which display the MasterCard, Cirrus, NYCE or SUM logos.
    


 




        Frequently Asked Questions






Q:


What is pre-approval?




A:


                    A pre-approval from your bank outlines the loan amount you may be able to borrow and helps your real estate agent focus your search on properties you will likely qualify to purchase. Century Bank provides this service at no cost to you.
                    



Q:


How long is the mortgage application process?




A:


                    Once your application is received, it typically takes 30 to 45 business days to close on the loan.
                    



Q:


What are the advantages of a Fixed Rate Mortgage?




A:


                    With a fixed rate mortgage your monthly principal and interest payment will never increase during the life of the loan.
                    



Q:


What are the advantages of an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM)?




A:


                    An ARM may come with a lower monthly payment amount than a fixed rate mortgage, which means you may qualify for a larger mortgage.
                    



Q:


Why would I want a Fixed Rate Mortgage vs. ARM?




A:


                    The type of mortgage you choose depends on your needs when you are buying a home. A Century Bank Borrowing Specialist will help you understand the best mortgage for your situation.
                    



Q:


What is a down payment?




A:


                    The down payment on the purchase of a home is the amount of cash you pay up front with the bank financing the remainder of the purchase price. Your Century Bank Borrowing Specialist will discuss all loan and down payment options available to you.
                    



Q:


What is Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)? 




A:


                    PMI is required when your down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price of a home. Your Century Bank Borrowing Specialist will tell you if this insurance applies to your situation and, if so, will estimate the cost for you.
                    



Q:


What is an appraisal? 




A:


                    An appraisal is a report on a property�s estimated value made by a certified appraiser. When you apply for a Century Bank mortgage loan, we will initiate the appraisal process for you.
                    



Q:


What is escrow? 




A:


                    Escrow is an account the bank holds in your name for amounts collected monthly along with your mortgage payments to cover taxes and/or insurance. When these obligations are due, the bank makes the payments for you.
                    



Q:


What is a point? 




A:


                    A point is a percentage of a mortgage amount, paid by the borrower to obtain the mortgage. Most of Century Bank�s loans do not come with points.
                    



Q:


What are closing costs?




A:


                    Closing costs are the fees and expenses associated with a mortgage transaction. The fees may include appraisal, credit report, attorney services, title insurance, and points, if applicable. Your Century Bank lending expert will provide you with an estimate of these costs when you submit your loan application.
                    



Q:


What is a home inspection? 




A:


                    A home inspection is optional but always a good idea. As the buyer of a property, you hire a professional home inspector to examine it and identify potential problems with the infrastructure that you should be aware of before you agree to complete the purchase.
                    



Q:


What is a jumbo loan? 




A:


                    A jumbo loan is a mortgage that exceeds the maximum loan amount established by Fannie Mae (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation). Jumbo loans are also referred to as non-conforming loans.
                    



Q:


Does Century Bank offer special programs for first-time home buyers? 




A:


                    Yes, let your Century Bank�Borrowing Specialist�know that you�re buying your first home because you may qualify for special programs that could include more flexible lending criteria.
                    








       Century Bank is pleased to provide FREE pre-approvals. Simply select the borrowing product you are most interested in and complete the application to the best of your ability. One of our loan officers will then contact you shortly.

Overdraft Bounce Protection Practices
We clear items drawn against your account in the following order:
(a) electronic transactions (electronic funds transfers, pre-authorized debits, debit card transactions, ATM transactions or other withdrawal requests); and (b) checks, in numerical sequence with lower numbers paid first, and other payments. If you maintain your checking account in good standing (defined as making regular deposits and bringing your account to a positive balance at least once every 30 days) and there are no legal orders outstanding, we may approve your reasonable overdraft. You may opt out of the privilege at any time by calling our Customer Service Center at (866) 823-6887, stopping by one of our conveniently located branches, or visiting CenturyBank.com and selecting the �contact us� tab to opt out of our overdraft Bounce Protection service. However, you are responsible for any overdrawn balances at the time of opting out. The amount of any overdraft plus our insufficient funds fee that you owe us shall be due and payable upon demand. If there is an overdraft paid by us on an account with more than one (1) owner on the signature card, each owner and agent, if applicable, drawing/presenting the item creating the overdraft, shall be jointly and severally liable for such overdraft plus our normal insufficient funds fee.
Limitations: Overdraft Bounce Protection is available to individually/ jointly owned and business accounts in good standing. Accounts of those under eighteen years of age are not eligible for the overdraft Bounce Protection product. Century Bank reserves the right to limit participation to one account per household or business and to discontinue this service without prior notice. The overdraft Bounce Protection program will not be available to new checking accounts until the account has been opened for 30 days and during that time, deposits to the account must be 80% of the predetermined limits of overdraft Bounce Protection assigned to that account type.

Century Bancorp, Inc. Announces Record Earnings For Q2 2017, Up 30.7%; Asset Growth To $4.5 BB; Regular Dividend Declared






Business Wire




Jul 11, 2017 4:45 PM EDT













 




























































  Century Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNBKA) ( www.centurybank.com) ("the Company") today announced net income of $14,253,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, or $2.56 per Class A share diluted, an increase of 23.4% compared to net income of $11,549,000, or $2.07 per Class A share diluted, for the same period a year ago. Total assets increased 1.9% from $4.46 billion at December 31, 2016 to $4.55 billion at June 30, 2017. For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, net income totaled $8,157,000 or $1.47 per Class A share diluted, an increase of 30.7% compared to net income of $6,241,000, or $1.12 per Class A share diluted, for the same period a year ago.  Net interest income totaled $42.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $36.1 million for the same period in 2016. The 17.9% increase in net interest income for the period is primarily due to an increase in average earning assets and an increase in the net interest margin. The net interest margin increased from 2.16% on a fully taxable equivalent basis in 2016 to 2.23% for the same period in 2017. This was primarily the result of an increase in rates on earning assets and prepayment penalties collected. The average balances of earning assets increased by 12.9% combined with a similar increase in average deposits. Also, interest expense increased 18.2% primarily as a result of an increase in rates and an increase in deposit balances.  The provision for loan losses increased by $90,000 from $800,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $890,000 for the same period in 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in loan growth offset, somewhat, by changes in historical loss factors. The Company's effective tax rate increased from 0.7% for the first six months of 2016 to 4.7% for the same period in 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in taxable income.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
