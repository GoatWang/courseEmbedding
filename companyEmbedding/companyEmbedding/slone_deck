Paints
As one of the world leading experts in paint and colour, Annie Sloan has developed paints that are not only fun to use, but easy too. For most surfaces, her decorative paint, Chalk Paint®, offers the ultimate in flexibility with colours that can be mixed together, lightened or darkened. Chalk Paint® can be thickened or thinned, used as a wash or even a dye. Seal it with clear Chalk Paint® Wax or Annie Sloan Lacquer. Annie's Wall Paint offers strength, durability, and a scrubbable matt finish perfect for walls and ceilings with no need to finish with wax. Gorgeous results have never been so simple and straightforward!

        Arch Coal elects Deck Slone as SVP
    


FROM STAFF REPORTS

Apr 23, 2012

 (…)
































































































Arch Coal elected Deck Slone as the company's senior vice president of strategy and public policy.

His appointment is effective June 1, and Slone will report to John Eaves, Creve Coeur-based Arch Coal's president and incoming CEO. 


"Deck has been a key member of Arch's senior management team for many years, and we expect him to play an even more pivotal role in Arch's future growth and success in this new capacity," Eaves said in a statement. Slone joined Arch Coal in 1997 and has served as corporate vice president of government, investor and public affairs since 2008.
In the announcement this morning, Arch Coal also named Jennifer Beatty vice president of investor relations. Beatty joined the company in 2005.

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple  professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse  portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each  professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in

								Valve Type
							


Valve Type
Sink Faucet Valve Types

Ceramic Disc: These are becoming the standard in bathroom faucets. Ceramic discs have replaced rubber discs inside the spout for a lifetime of drip and leak free performance


Washerlesss Cartridge: These valves are easier to repair and tend to cost less than other valve styles, but they tend to require more maintenance over the lifetime of your faucet


Metering and Self-Closing: These valves are used mostly in commercial applications where you want to reduce the amount of water used. When turned on water will flow for a set period of time, and then turn off automatically.


Solenoid: These valves are used mostly in commercial applications where you want to reduce the amount of water used. When turned on water will flow for a set period of time, and then turn off automatically.

Shower Valve Types

Pressure Balanced: The pressure-balanced shower valve compensates for changes in water pressure. It reacts to relative changes in either hot or cold water pressure to maintain balanced pressure. As water pressure drops on one supply line, the valve reduces the pressure in the other supply line to match.


Thermostatic: A thermostatic mixing valve (TMV) is a valve that blends hot water with cold water to ensure constant, safe shower and bath outlet temperatures. The use of a thermostat provides increased safety against scalding, and increased user comfort, because the hot-water temperature remains constant.
