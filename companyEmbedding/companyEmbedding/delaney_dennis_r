Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NN (NASDAQ:NNBR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $33.50 (20.29% upside)

Dennis Delaney’s Comments on Trends in the Trust Industry
“My job often addresses the nexus of many, often conflicting, challenges for my clients. They want to provide financial stability for descendants while keeping them motivated to lead engaged, productive lives. Much of their wealth consists of their family owned business; they want to reward children who help grow it, but also ensure that children who don’t work in it are treated fairly. They have a profound commitment to charitable giving and want to maximize their impact. They would like their vacation home to be enjoyed by future generations but don’t want their estate plan to create friction among family members. These issues are not easy, but nor are they new. For over 150 years we have helped generations of clients achieve their personal and family goals.”

What are analysts saying about Rockwell Automation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Rockwell Automation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Rockwell Automation projects fiscal 2017 sales growth in the range of 4.5–7.5% and expects adjusted EPS in the range of $6.45–$6.75 per share. The company will benefit from the consistent growth in the consumer and transportation verticals. It expects heavy industries to grow in 2017 despite the prevailing softness in oil and gas and mining. Further, increased investment, acquisitions, product launches and share repurchases will support growth. The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. However, Rockwell Automation's results will be hurt by foreign currency headwinds, weakness in the heavy industry vertical, lack of higher margin project and weak commodity prices. Moreover, the company's shares have underperformed the Zacks categorized sub-industry in the past one year." (7/12/2017)
2. Barclays PLC analysts commented, "We are updating our model following ROK's F1Q17 earnings release. Our 2017E core growth goes to 3% from 1% driven by better than expected book/bill and actual results in the quarter. We had previously expected the year to be more back-end loaded. Our 2017E EPS goes to $6.25 from $6.10. Our 2018E EPS goes to $6.90 from $6.85, as we remain somewhat conservative in light of low visibility on timing /magnitude of the recovery. Bias to numbers is likely upward, however. Our PT goes to $166 (24x our 2018E EPS of $6.90) from $144 (21x our prior 2018E EPS of $6.85)." (1/26/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 11 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.07)Consensus Price Target: $148.31 (10.10% downside)
