WrestleMania Promos Take Over Orlando

A week of magic and mayhem has ended as World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) presented WrestleMania 33 – professional wrestling’s annual promo-filled Super Bowl inside Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. And, Counselor was on the scene to see all of the promotions that sponsors and hosts were running.

An all-time Orlando Citrus Bowl attendance record of 75,245 fans from 50 states and 62 countries made the pilgrimage to witness their favorite athletes clash at the nearly seven-hour event. WrestleMania 33 gained a record 18 million social media fan engagements, up 66% from last year. Digital and social media video views reached 133 million, skyrocketing 105% from 2016. For the first time, WrestleMania was made available in China on a pay-per-view basis via PPTV’s digital platform.
“WrestleMania made a triumphant return to Orlando and again broke multiple records,” said WWE Executive Vice President of Special Events John Saboor in a press release. “This success would not have been possible without the tireless support of Mayor Dyer, the Local Organizing Committee and all of the public and private sector partners throughout Central Florida.”
WrestleMania 33 grossed $14.5 million in revenue, down from the company’s record $17.3 million for last year’s event. It also generated an estimated $125 million in economic impact for the Central Florida area. That’s why each year cities bid on hosting the pop culture extravaganza – New Orleans has been chosen over Philadelphia and Minneapolis to hold WrestleMania 34 next year as part of the city’s tricentennial celebration.

"WrestleMania Week was a tremendous success for the city of Orlando and it was an honor to host WWE and their fans back in our community," said Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer. "This is a testament to the investments we've made in our community venues that continue to attract these showcase events and solidify Orlando as the nation's leading sports and entertainment destination." Orlando is home to many WWE operations including its developmental brand NXT and its training facility the WWE Performance Center.
As soon as fans arrived at Orlando International Airport, they were greeted by WrestleMania signs at baggage claim and rental car stations. The streets of downtown Orlando were plastered in WrestleMania banners showcasing top stars such as Brock Lesnar and Goldberg. There was even a 30-foot-wide, 12-foot-high championship belt replica on display at Lake Eola.  
Throughout the week, fans mobbed the Orange County Convention Centerin Orlando for WrestleMania Axxess, an annual fan fest with autograph signings, exhibits and merchandise. Attendees scooped up hats, shirts, wrist bands, posters, foam hands, and inflatable Bailey buddies, all emblazoned with the WrestleMania and WWE logos. Snickers sponsored the event for the second straight year, giving out free candy bars and sharing clips through social media and YouTube. During the WrestleMania broadcast, an ad featured WWE Hall of Famer Ric Flair and WWE Superstars Charlotte and James Ellsworth as part of the “You’re Not You When You're Hungry" campaign.

Coffee Mug Is Popular Promo for News Station

Los Angeles Tribune  TV station’s KTLA 5 will be celebrating a milestone anniversary with an iconic  item that appeals to a wide target audience. 
The “Anchor Desk”  drinkware, which is placed prominently on the studio desk during broadcasts, is  a 15-oz. coffee mug. When the station worked with its distributor partner to  develop a giveaway program celebrating 70 years of broadcasting, a special  anniversary edition of this mug was the logical item. The mugs have been a coveted  giveaway among viewers over the years.

Beginning on KTLA’s  70th anniversary date, the “Watch and Win” promotion gives viewers  in the Los Angeles area the opportunity to text the station with a specific  code word during its daily broadcast. KTLA then chooses winning viewers to  receive a special-edition anniversary branded mug that matches the official  Anchor Desk drinkware. The station was provided with 2,500 of the double-sided  mugs. The promotion will run all year, and if the anchor mugs’ popularity is  any indicator, they’ll continue to drive many viewers to enter the contest.

Surfs Up

Luxury  swimwear brand Basta Surf’s identity is built on a line of  conscientiously-produced beach apparel aimed at discriminating customers.  Shoring up that brand identity means that even the hang tags on Basta’s  products must reflect values of quality, subtlety and an environmentally  conscious worldview.
So, when  Basta approached its distributor partner with an idea for a seeded hangtag, the  rep knew just the right product. She suggested the seeded paper hang tag, an  idea that became a resounding success. “They wanted to elevate their brand,”  the rep says. “They thought that this would be effective in showing their earth  consciousness and organic materials.” 

Basta  donates a part of its profits to causes that promote clean water. The company  promoted this eco-conscious initiative on the back of the letter-pressed tags.  Beyond complementing Basta’s environmental efforts, the wildflower-seeded tags  promote a free-and-fruitful attitude that is in keeping with Basta’s worldview.  The rep adds: “It allows the business to show the customer they are thinking of  them in other ways than just selling swimwear.”

PROPERTIES OF SHIMS 
SIZE
The most important properties of shims are their ability to separate and adjust the spacing between items in construction. The thickness of a shim is chosen according to the depth of the space it is intended to maintain. The footprint is chosen according to handling and load distribution needs. A permanent shim should be sized to fit entirely within the joint, behind the finish materials and without interfering with any sealant that can be installed in the joint.

SHAPE
• Flat Blocks are used for simple conditions where spaces will be later filled with grout or sealant, such as joints in tilt up concrete panel construction.
• U-Shapes fit around bolts and are useful for many systems of construction, including precast concrete cladding and curtain wall systems.
• Wedges are used anywhere wood is inappropriate and a gap needs filling.

COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH
Choose compressive strength that can withstand the expected dead loads, construction loads, and live loads that the shim will carry. Shims carry large loads over their small footprints during construction, before the final fastening is complete, so including a factor of safety is a good idea. See shim Properties Chart for compressive strengths available with different materials. (Test reports are available.) 

CREEP
Shims with compressive strength adequate to the task at hand won't deform under the expected loads. By contrast, materials like wood suffer from "creep" (deformation overtime), forcing installers to guess at the final compressed thickness when selecting shims. Choosing structural shims takes the guesswork out of installation. It is worth noting that creep can be a problem with high-density polyethylene used as permanent support.

RESILIENCE 
Resilience is the ability of a shim to compress under load, then return to its previous shape when the load is released. It is expressed in Rockwell Hardness and Shore D Hardness. Resilience is often required in glazing systems and other panelized cladding systems. When materials being separated are brittle, like glass or stone, the shim's job is to absorb some of the load imposed by movement of the system. Consult Glass Association of North America (GANA) standards for glazing systems and manufacturer's recommendations for other materials.

IMPACT RESISTANCE 
Impact resistance is the shim's ability to withstand a sudden force, usually over a small area, without breaking or crushing. Impact resistance is often required for shims used to install glazing systems. When high impact resistance is required, high-impact polystyrene or PVC shims are often required.

RESISTANCE TO BRITTLE FAILURE 
If very cold temperatures are expected during construction or the service life of the shim, brittle failure needs to be considered. The temperature at which cracking occurs should be below the expected ambient temperature. In some conditions, the shim can be retained in the joint with adhesive, making cracking less of a concern. 

FIRE RESISTANCE
Shims that will remain permanently within an assembly may be required to be fire-resistant. In these cases, the following criteria may apply:
• Melting Point: Not less than 170° F, ASTM D1238.
• Flame Spread: Class A, under 25; Class B, 26-75; Class C, 76-200, ASTM E84.
• Smoke Developed: 450 or less for Classes A, B and C, ASTM E84.
• Noncombustiblity: Pass/Fail, ASTM E136.
• UL 94 V-0, normally for computer components, is available for special requirements.

COMPATIBILITY
A compatible material does not react with or chemically affect the materials it touches. It will not transfer color or oils, produce stains, nor corrode the item being shimmed. It will also be unaffected by the adjacent materials. Polypropylene and polystyrene both excel in this feature, being unaffected by most construction materials. In fact, inert plastics are often used to separate dissimilar materials that would otherwise react with each other: separating aluminum from concrete, for instance, or aluminum from steel. 

VERMIN AND DECAY RESISTANCE
Inert plastic shims can remain in place indefinitely, without contributing nutrients to unwanted organisms like mold or insects. Unlike wood and wood products, Grove Structural Shims do not rot or degrade.

EASE OF USE  
• Color Coding: Shims are colored by thickness, simplifying and speeding selection and inspection in the field.
• Stackability: Stackable shims can fit virtually any size joint, from 1/32" to 6", by combining standard sizes. Grove Structural Shims can be banded together. They also are readily heat-welded at the edges, forming a permanent stack custom-built for the joint required.
• Fitting: In order to fit joint requirements, shims should be available in a variety of widths and in shapes that are easily cut to size. Grove Structural Shims offers 6-inch and 8-inch wedge shims that are notched to be snapped at convenient lengths and depths.

THERMAL PERFORMANCE  
Shims can act as a thermal break between conductive materials. Measured in BTU per hour or in Watts, the thermal conductance of plastic is lower than that of aluminum or steel.  For example, shims can help reduce thermal transfer from cladding materials such as precast concrete into structural elements.


COMMON TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION WORK USING SHIMS 
In general, shims are used to hold heavy objects in place until they are permanently attached with bolts, welding, grout, adhesive, or other methods. Examples of this use occur in many areas of construction. The list below is not exhaustive, but serves to demonstrate the versatility of shims.

DIVISION 03
Tilt-up Concrete: Level and align panels in preparation for final attachment.
Precast Concrete Panels: Align panels vertically and horizontally and maintain joint spacings before final attachment.

DIVISION 04  
Stone Masonry: Temporary and permanent joint spacing.
Stone Panel Cladding: Align panels vertically and horizontally to relieve stress while mortar sets.
Terra Cotta: Brittle materials can be temporarily cushioned with shims before being fixed or sealed into place.

DIVISION 05  
Typically, structural steel is shimmed with steel shims. However, many other metal objects are shimmed temporarily with plastic shims before welding, grouting, or bolting into place. Plastic shims can also separate dissimilar metals or provide a thermal break.

DIVISION 06  
Heavy wood member that would crush a wood shim can be shimmed with plastic shim. Typical applications include: heavy timber framing, glu-lam members, and prefabricated joists or trusses.

DIVISION 07  
Wall and Roof Panels: Align panels, girts, and purlins.

DIVISION 08  
Doors and Frames: Align frames while fastening in place.
Entrance, Storefront, and Curtain Wall Systems: Align members or panels, vertically and horizontally; separating glass panels, permanently or temporarily.
Blast-Resistant Doors and Windows: Extra resilience may be required for permanent shims.
Skylights and Sloped Glazing Systems: Alignment.
Louver Systems: Alignment.

DIVISION 09  
Stone Flooring: Temporary spacing. Interior Stone Cladding: Align panels.

DIVISION 10  
Heavy objects such as directories, signage, and telephone kiosks can be aligned temporarily with shims before being permanently fixed into place. Tracks for folding, sliding, or coiling partitions can be shimmed for alignment and thus the smoother operation of the partitions. Shims can also be required for heavy-duty tub and shower doors, storage specialties, and flagpoles.

DIVISION 11  
Heavy objects such as parking equipment and loading dock equipment can be aligned temporarily with shims before being permanently fixed into place.

DIVISION 12  
Heavy objects such as metal benches, bleachers, and fixed audience seating can be aligned temporarily with shims before being permanently fixed into place.

DIVISION 13  
Amusement park structures and equipment. Kennel enclosures and gates.

DIVISION 14  
Elevators: Align rails and equipment. Escalators and moving walks. Lifts.

DIVISION 23  
HVAC equipment can be aligned with shims before being permanently fixed into place. 

SPECIFYING SHIMS
GENERAL
Shims are considered "accessories" and are appropriately specified with other parts of each building system.
PRODUCTS  
Review the criteria listed above and include specification necessary to assure proper performance for project conditions. It is usually unnecessary for the specifier to require a specific shape or size of shim. When load bearing is important, specify that shims shall be solid and that hollowed profiles will not be accepted.
EXECUTION  
Execution requirements for shims should also be results-oriented. Example requirements may include:
• "Shims shall not remain permanently exposed to view, sun, or weather."
• "Hold shims back from face of panel at least two times joint width." (For mortar or grout joints)
• "Shims shall not intrude into depth required for sealant and backer rod specified." (For sealant joints)
• "Remove shims progressively as sealant is installed" (For movement joints in stone flooring)
• "Install shims to shed water. Horseshoe and keyslot shim openings shall face down." (For shims in cladding, outside the weather barrier)
• "Do not shim [secondary structural members] [cladding members] more than [1/2 inch] without written acceptance by [Architect ][Engineer]."

RichhtmlPlaceholderDefinitionWhat Are Line Vac Conveyors?




EXAIR's compressed air operated Line Vac connects to standard hose, pipe or tube to create a powerful in-line conveyor. The compact design features large throat diameters for maximum throughput capacity. They are available in a variety of styles and sizes that are suited to a wide variety of transfer applications.Watch the Video!
A Model 6080 3/4" (19mm)Line Vac vacuums plastic as itis drilled.

Why The Line Vac?Line Vac conveyors are ideal for moving large volumes of material over long distances. A small amount of compressed air is injected through directed nozzles to produce a vacuum on one end and high output flows on the other, with instantaneous response.
(2) Model 6083 1-1/2" (38mm) Line Vacs conveyrejected metal caps from afluorescent lamp operation toa scrap bin.

The material flow rate is easily controlled with a pressure regulator. No moving parts or electricity assures maintenance-free operation.
1-1/4" (32mm) Line Vac is mountedon a burr removal tool to suction the plastic shavings and transport themto a waste container.
A fast, low cost way to convey:





Plastic pellets 
Paper 
Scrap trim 
Pills/tablets 
Textiles 
Small parts


Bulk Solids 
Shavings 
Food products 
Sawdust 
Chips
