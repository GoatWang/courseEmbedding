(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  The following information should be read in conjunction with XFit Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("we", "us", "our", or the "Company") condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Information in this Item 2, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that does not consist of historical facts, are "forward-looking statements." Statements accompanied or qualified by, or containing words such as "may," "will," "should," "believes," "expects," "intends," "plans," "projects," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "outlook," "forecast," "anticipates," "presume," and "assume" constitute forward-looking statements, and as such, are not a guarantee of future performance.  Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of the factors described in the "Risk Factors" and detailed in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Risks and uncertainties can include, among others, fluctuations in general business cycles and changing economic conditions; changing product demand and industry capacity; increased competition and pricing pressures; and advances in technology that can reduce the demand for the Company's products. Consequently, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as predictive of future results.  Because of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this report or incorporated by reference might not transpire. Factors that cause actual results or conditions to differ from those anticipated by these and other forward-looking statements include those more fully described elsewhere in this report and in the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June, 30, 2015.  Except as required by law, The Company disclaims any obligation to update the forward-looking statements in this report.  Overview  XFit Brands, Inc. was incorporated in September 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. As used herein, the terms "we," "us," "XFIT," and the "Company" refer to XFit Brands, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries, and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our fiscal year end is June 30. Our principal office address is 25731 Commercentre Drive, Lake Forest, CA 92630. Our telephone number is (949) 916-9680. As of February 14, 2017, we had 11 employees.  Our principal business activity is the design, development, and worldwide marketing and selling of functional equipment, training gear, apparel, and accessories for the impact sports market and fitness industry. Our products are marketed and sold under our Throwdown(R), XFit Brands(R), and Transformations(TM) brand names to gyms, fitness facilities, and directly to consumers via our internet website and through third party catalogues (which we refer to as our "Direct to Consumer" operations) through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world. All of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Our equipment and apparel products are produced both in the United States and abroad.  We are an "emerging growth company" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies," including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.  Results of Operations  For the next twelve months, our current operating plan is focused on the development and sale of sports surfaces, training and protective gear for the Mixed Martial Arts ("MMA"), fitness, training, and exercise industry.  Our long term growth strategy includes expanding our presence in the fitness, training, and exercise community; leveraging our MMA core credibility and heritage; developing strategic alliances; and acquiring other companies in the fitness, training, and exercise industry to leverage our asset base, manufacturing infrastructure, market presence, and experienced personnel.  As is discussed further in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we have limited funds to support our operations. Our continuation as a going concern subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2017 is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing to fund the continued operation of our business model for a long enough period to achieve profitable operations. Based on our current business plan, we currently estimate we will need up to an additional $600,000 of financing to execute our business plan over the next twelve months. There can be no assurance, however, that such financing will be available or, if it is available, that we will be able to structure such financing on terms acceptable to us and that it will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements until we can reach a level of profitable operations and positive cash flows. If we are unable to obtain the financing necessary to support our operations, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.  Six months ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Six Months Ended December 31, 2015  Our revenue, operating expenses, and net loss from operations for the six month period ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the six month period ended December 31, 2015, are set forth below.

The increase in product sales is attributable to increased selling efforts and momentum during the six months ended December 31, 2016.  Cost of Revenues. Total cost of revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2016 were $854,937, an increase of $209,606, or 32%, from $645,331 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to cost of turf materials and installation for a project at Enviroturf.  Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased $(5,218) to $497,382 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, from a gross profit of $502,600 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in gross profit reflects the increase in product cost of sales in connection with promotional activity, During the six months ended December 31, 2016, we realized a 36% gross profit on our product sales as compared to a 44% gross profit on product sales during the six months ended December 31, 2015. The lower gross profit achieved during the six months ended December 31, 2015 is promotional activity with the fitness accessories at Xfit.  General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $77,212 or 9%, to $924,717 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 from $847,505 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. General & administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2016 are comprised of salaries and wages of $417,229, professional fees of $215,402, office expenses of $12,610, insurance of $56,388, rent of $141,721, travel of $32,996, and other of $48,371.

Sales and Marketing Expense. Sales and marketing expense decreased $35,693 or 20%, to $138,503 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 from $174,196 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in sales and marketing expense is attributable to a decrease in wages and sales commissions due to the termination of a sales employee.  Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $94,592 to $353,148 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 from $258,556 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. The increase is largely due to the increased interest expense on the delayed draw note with the PIMCO Fund during the six months ended December 31, 2016.  Net Loss. Net loss increased by $275,031 or 35% to a net loss of $1,052,688 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 from a net loss of $777,657 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. This increase in net loss is attributable to a loss on the extinguishment of debt and a loss on operating the EnviroTurf division.  Three months ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2015  Our revenue, operating expenses, and net loss from operations for the three month period ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2015, are set forth below.

Net loss increased by $305,267 or 90% to a net loss of $646,235 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 from a net loss of $340,968 for the three months ended December 31, 2015. This increase in our net loss is attributable to a loss on the extinguishment of debt and a loss on the operation of the EnviroTurf division.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the consolidated financial statements, we incurred a net loss of $1,052,688 during the six months ended December 31, 2016, and losses are expected to continue in the near term. The accumulated deficit since inception is $8,845,945 at December 31, 2016. We have been funding our operations through private loans and the sale of equity interests in private placement transactions. See our discussion of our Credit Facility with PIMCO and our Equity Purchase Agreement with Kodiak Capital below. Our cash resources are insufficient to meet our planned business objectives without additional financing. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of our company to continue as a going concern.  Management anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to further develop our product lines and licensing relationships to expand product sales and royalty revenues before significant positive operating cash flows can be achieved. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. At December 31, 2016, we had $78,745 of cash on hand. We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our cash from operating activities will not be sufficient to fund operations and expected growth through at least the next twelve months. These funds are insufficient to complete our business plan and as a consequence, we will need to seek additional funds, primarily through the issuance of debt or equity securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stock holders, in case of equity financing.  Management has undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and beyond. These steps include (a) raising additional capital and/or obtaining financing; (b) executing contracts with international licensees; and (c) controlling overhead and expenses. There can be no assurance that we can successfully accomplish these steps and it is uncertain that we will achieve a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all.  In the event we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may elect or be required to seek protection from our creditors by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, management has not considered this alternative, nor does management view it as a likely occurrence.  The success of our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining new customers for our products and new licensees to generate royalty revenues, and maintaining a break even or profitable level of operations. We have incurred operating losses since inception, and this is likely to continue in the near future. We believe that we are able to fund our immediate operations, working capital requirements, and debt service requirements with existing working capital, cash flows generated from operations, and additional borrowings under our delayed draw note or, if available, under our equity purchase agreement with GHS.  Our financial requirements will be dependent upon the financial support through credit facilities and additional sales of our equity securities. There can be no assurance, however, that such financing will be available or, if it is available, that we will be able to structure such financing on terms acceptable to us and that it will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements until we can reach a level of profitable operations and positive cash flows. If we are unable to obtain the financing necessary to support our operations, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. We currently have a verbal commitment but no formal written commitments for any additional capital.  The downturn in the United States stock and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Further, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our shares of common stock or the debt securities may cause us to be subject to restrictive covenants. If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our operations.  Cash, total current assets, total assets, total current liabilities and total liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 are as follows:   December 31, 2016 June 30, 2016 Cash $ 78,745 $ 6,829 Total current assets $ 1,136,267 $ 588,709 Total assets $ 1,260,132 $ 663,492 Total current liabilities $ 1,008,425 $ 1,263,665 Total liabilities $ 4,508,425 $ 3,742,385  Credit Facility  On June 10, 2014, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement ("Agreement") with PIMCO Funds: Private Account Portfolio Series: PIMCO High Yield Portfolio, a separate investment portfolio of PIMCO Funds, a Massachusetts business trust ("PIMCO") that authorized the issuance of up to $2,500,000. On June 12, 2014, we entered into a Senior Secured Note ("Note") whereby we drew $1,500,000. The note bears interest at 14% and matures on June 12, 2017. Interest in payable monthly in arrears, provided that if no event of default has occurred, Obligor can elect to pay cash interest on each payment date at 9%, with the additional unpaid interest due on such dates added to the principal balance, The note bears an effective interest rate of 21%. This Note is collateralized by all of our assets. The Note includes various covenants, including but not limited to, having annual audited financial statements within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year.  On February 6, 2015, we drew an additional $500,000 under this facility to increase the principal amount payable (including the accrued interest added to the principal amount) under this note to $2,044,300 and on October 20, 2015, we drew the remaining $500,000 available under this facility to increase the amount payable under this note (with accrued interest) to $2,620,098. We issued 10,000 shares of our common stock to PIMCO as a loan fee in consideration of the October 2015 draw down. A replacement note was issued on each draw down date to reflect the note increase.  On December 16, 2016 we entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement (the "PIMCO Amendment") with PIMCO pursuant to which we issued a $3.5 million 9% Senior Secured Fixed Rate Note due July 12, 2020 (the "Note"). The Note refinanced our prior 14% Senior Secured Note in the principal amount of $2.5 million (the "Prior Note"), providing us with an additional $1 million in working capital. As with the Prior Note, the Note is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets (other than those sold pursuant to our factoring agreement with Crown Financial).  In connection with the PIMCO Amendment, (i) PIMCO converted $278,689 in accrued and unpaid interest into 1,990,639 shares of our common stock. In addition we had previously issued PIMCO a warrant to purchase ten percent of our equity at an exercise price of $1.5 million. We amended the terms of the common stock purchase warrant previously issued to PIMCO to reduce the exercise price thereof to $350,000 to reflect the market capitalization of the Company as of the date of the Amendment  Crown Financial, LLC Factoring Agreement  On August 3, 2016 we entered into an Agreement with Crown Financial, LLC which advances 80% of invoices approved and assumed by Crown for collection. Depending on the length of time taken to collect the invoices we will receive additional payments from Crown ranging from 18.25% if collected within 20 days to 0% if collected in 120 days. Crown has the right to require us to repurchase unpaid invoices outstanding for more than 120 days. PIMCO has waived its security interest in invoices assigned to Crown.  GHS Investment Agreement  On August 13, 2016 we entered into an Investment Agreement (the "Investment Agreement") with GHS Investments, LLC ("GHS"). Although we are not mandated to sell shares under the Investment Agreement, the Investment Agreement gives us the option to sell to GHS, up to $5,000,000 worth of our common stock ("Shares"), over the period following effectiveness of the registration of a registration statement covering the resale of the Shares (the "Effective Date") and ending thirty-six (36) months after the Effective Date. Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, we have the right to deliver from time to time a Put Notice to GHS stating the dollar amount of Put Shares (up to $500,000 under any individual Put Notice)(the "Put Amount") that we intend to sell to GHS with the price per share based on the following formula: the lesser of (a) the lowest sale price for the Common Stock on the date of the Put Notice (the "Put Notice Date"); or (b) the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest trading prices for the Company's Common Stock during the five trading days following the Put Notice Date. The maximum number of shares that can be put to GHS is two times the average daily trading volume during the ten trading days prior to the closing of a put (the "Closing Date").

Our Registration Statement with respect to the resale of the shares of Common Stock delivered in connection with the applicable Put shall have been declared effective.  ? at all times during the period beginning on the date of the Put Notice and ending on the date of the related closing, our common stock has been listed on the Principal Market as defined in the Investment Agreement (which includes, among others, the OTC Market: QB Tier) and shall not have been suspended from trading thereon.  ? we have complied with its obligations and is otherwise not in breach of or in default under the Investment Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement or any other agreement executed in connection therewith;  ? no injunction has been issued and remains in force, and no action has been commenced by a governmental authority which has not been stayed or abandoned, prohibiting the purchase or the issuance of the Put Shares; and  ? the issuance of the Put Shares will not violate any shareholder approval requirements of the market or exchange on which our common stock is principally listed.  GHS will not engage in any "short-sale" (as defined in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO) of our common stock at any time during this Agreement. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement with GHS, we agreed to pay a fee equaling $250,000 or 5%of . . .  Feb 24, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

The Studio Box is the first immersive boxing fitness studio that drops into any Big Box Gym Facility. The Studio comes with branded equipment, live workouts via BOXFIIT Trainer APP, custom music playlists, and business support, including but limited to marketing, and trainer certifications.
XFit Brands® latest innovation is an industry first that allows health clubs to optimize space utilization in their outlets by employing heavy bags workout regimens for one fitness segment, and to seamlessly and effortlessly shift all the heavy bags and equipment to the side to utilize the space into multifunctional purposes. The XFit Brands® patent pending system is called The Perfect Placement Trolley and was engineered to fill a health club industry operator's void to have the most versatile training options for their members while being hyper efficient in limited space settings.

George Foreman III (founder) of EverybodyFights commented, "XFIT Brands provided us with a safe and durable equipment product that we can scale our business. XFit's Throwdown® trolley system is special because it provides a solution to the need of creating a dynamic boxing fitness space that can be used for many fitness uses. We are looking forward to expanding the relationship as we grow our Box business nationwide."
 
XFit Brands, Inc., Throwdown® Perfect Placement Trolley features a duel strap system the engages and releases the brake on the Throwdown I-Beam systems. With a simple pull of the strap, the brake is released or secured. The trolley enables the operators to adjust the distance between bags or simply repurpose the space for other functional fitness uses. The Perfect Placement trolley transforms a bag room into a suspension training studio, grappling area or other functional training space. The Throwdown® Perfect Placement Trolley system can be used on several of Throwdown's vast portfolio of functional fitness equipment including the Elite Free Standing Bag Rack and Cantilever Bag rack systems which are currently deployed in leading gyms and fitness outlets worldwide.

This latest Perfect Placement Trolley system is just another innovation in a series of industry leading products the Company has delivered as it responds to the evolving trends toward functional fitness and away from traditional stationary cardio equipment and weight machines. We are excited to work with the team at EverybodyFights. Their incredible facility and impressive leadership team, coupled with the credibility of the Foreman name and heritage is best in class."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
