First Tennessee[edit]
First Tennessee banking services are available to individual consumers as well as businesses of all sizes. Combined, the bank’s customer base represents the largest deposit share in four of Tennessee’s five major metropolitan areas. First Tennessee has one of the highest customer retention rates of any bank in the country.[citation needed]
FTB Advisors, Inc.[edit]
First Tennessee offers its customers a wide range of wealth management services through its affiliate, FTB Advisors, Inc. FTB Advisors was launched as the primary name for First Tennessee’s Wealth Management division in 2013, but the company has been supporting the sophisticated financial needs of affluent customers for much of its history. The company’s services include guidance focused on investments, retirement, insurance, trusts, financial planning, and estate planning.
FTN Financial[edit]
FTN Financial is an industry leader in fixed income sales, trading, and strategies for institutional customers in the U.S. and abroad. FTN Financial also provides investment services and balance sheet management solutions. With an average daily trading volume of over $5 billion, FTN transacts business with approximately one-half of all domestic depository institutions with portfolios larger than $100 million
History[edit]
Frank S. Davis started the first national bank in Memphis after the National Banking Act of 1863 was passed. The charter was received March 25, 1864.[2]
Capital Bank[edit]
On May 4, Capital Bank Financial said it agreed to a $2.2 billion purchase by First Horizon. Once the deal is completed, First Horizon will have $40 billion in assets, and the Capital Bank name will continue to be used outside Tennessee.[1]

First Tennessee[edit]
First Tennessee banking services are available to individual consumers as well as businesses of all sizes. Combined, the bank’s customer base represents the largest deposit share in four of Tennessee’s five major metropolitan areas. First Tennessee has one of the highest customer retention rates of any bank in the country.[citation needed]
FTB Advisors, Inc.[edit]
First Tennessee offers its customers a wide range of wealth management services through its affiliate, FTB Advisors, Inc. FTB Advisors was launched as the primary name for First Tennessee’s Wealth Management division in 2013, but the company has been supporting the sophisticated financial needs of affluent customers for much of its history. The company’s services include guidance focused on investments, retirement, insurance, trusts, financial planning, and estate planning.
FTN Financial[edit]
FTN Financial is an industry leader in fixed income sales, trading, and strategies for institutional customers in the U.S. and abroad. FTN Financial also provides investment services and balance sheet management solutions. With an average daily trading volume of over $5 billion, FTN transacts business with approximately one-half of all domestic depository institutions with portfolios larger than $100 million
History[edit]
Frank S. Davis started the first national bank in Memphis after the National Banking Act of 1863 was passed. The charter was received March 25, 1864.[2]
Capital Bank[edit]
On May 4, Capital Bank Financial said it agreed to a $2.2 billion purchase by First Horizon. Once the deal is completed, First Horizon will have $40 billion in assets, and the Capital Bank name will continue to be used outside Tennessee.[1]

Capital Bank's stock slumps after buyout deal values regional bank at a discount
Shares of Capital Bank Financial Corp.  slumped 4.9% in premarket trade Thursday, as terms of the $2.2 billion buyout deal with First Horizon National Corp.  valued Capital Bank at a discount. First Horizon will exchange 1.750 of its shares and $7.90 in cash for each Capital Bank share outstanding. Based on Wednesday's closing prices, that values Capital Bank shares at $40.835 each, which is 2.9% below Wednesday's closing price of $42.05. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter. The banks said the merger will create the fourth-largest regional bank in the Southeast. Capital Bank's stock had gained 7.1% year to date through Wednesday, while First Horizon shares fell 6%, the iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF  slipped 0.5% and the S&P 500  gained 6.7%.

What’s Acceptable Profitability For First Horizon National Corporation (FHN) and Mueller Water Products, Inc. (MWA)?

By Luis Castro -   July 21, 2017 



 








Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter










Shares of First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE:FHN) are on a recovery track as they have regained 24.42% since bottoming out at $14.29 on Aug. 02, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 1.31% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -11.14% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -14.68% from $20.84 , the 52-week high touched on Jan. 26, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 21.03% for the past 12 months.
FHN Target Price Reaches $20.25
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold First Horizon National Corporation (FHN)’s shares projecting a $20.25 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly First Horizon National Corporation (FHN)’s Sales Declined?
 FHN’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -0.4% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 13% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
Mueller Water Products, Inc. Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, First Horizon National Corporation net profit margin for the 12 months is at 21.65%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 28.56%, and the sector’s average is 27.9%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 Mueller Water Products, Inc. (NYSE:MWA) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -18.94% since hitting a peak level of $14.2 on Dec. 09, 2016. Thanks to an increase of almost 1.86% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -13.52% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 10.14% higher from $10.45, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Nov. 04, 2016, but are collecting gains at -10.5% for the past six months.
Analysts See Mueller Water Products, Inc. 2.49% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for Mueller Water Products, Inc. (MWA) to grow. At recent closing price of $11.51, MWA has a chance to add $2.49 or 21.63% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($14) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.1 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.38 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are Mueller Water Products, Inc. (NYSE:MWA) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, Mueller Water Products, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly 51.8%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 16.8%, annually.
Is MWA Turning Profits into Returns?
 Mueller Water Products, Inc. (MWA)’s ROE is 12.74%, while industry’s is 10.56%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 7.53%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 Mueller Water Products, Inc.’s ROA is 4.35%, while industry’s average is 7.16%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 4.83. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

 HISTORY LEADERSHIP CULTURE AWARDS REGIONAL BANKING FIXED INCOME WEALTH MANAGEMENT



































About Us | History












The beginning ...






























Frank S. Davis sat in his hotel room listening to the sounds outside. He heard the clatter of horse-drawn wagons, the tramp of marching feet, and the shouts of military commands. The time was March 1864 and the city was Memphis.
Davis, understanding these hard times, sensed a real need for an expansion of banking and credit facilities. When the National Banking Act of 1863 was passed, Davis recognized the many advantages offered by a system of national banks chartered and supervised by the Federal government. It was because of this insight that Davis founded the city's first national bank, which grew into today's First Horizon National Corp., the parent company of First Tennessee Bank and FTN Financial.
The bank's charter was received on March 25, 1864. To Davis, that date marked the fulfillment of an earnest ambition; to Memphians, it was the beginning of a new era in banking.
The 150th anniversary of the company was celebrated in 2014, spotlighting the legacy of serving customers that began when Abraham Lincoln was president. 
"First Tennessee has served customers through civil war and world war, a yellow fever epidemic, the Great Depression and the Great Recession," said Bryan Jordan, chairman and CEO of First Horizon. "We're proud of that legacy, and we're focused on the future. We're building for our next 150 years."
First Tennessee is the market share leader in Tennessee. FTN Financial is a capital markets leader in fixed income sales, trading, and strategies, with average trading volumes in excess of $5 billion per day. 
"Our First Tennessee team is carrying on a tradition that has been important to Tennessee and to generations of customers," Jordan said. "With our 150th anniversary celebration, we are renewing our promise to be the best at serving our customers, one opportunity at a time."
First Horizon National Corp. is now one of the 40 largest banking companies in the U.S. in asset size and market capitalization. 
Our family of companies has 4,300 employees who provide the highest quality service in banking, insurance, fixed-income investments, mortgage, credit and financial planning. First Horizon, First Tennessee and FTN Financial also claim some of the most loyal and satisfied customers in the industry. First Horizon has been recognized as one of the nation's best employers by American Banker and Working Mother magazines and as a top tech innovator by InformationWeek magazine.
