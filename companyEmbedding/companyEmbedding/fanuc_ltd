FANUC Tsukuba branch


FANUC (/ˈfænʊk/; often styled Fanuc) is a group of companies, principally FANUC Corporation (ファナック株式会社, Fanakku Kabushikigaisha) of Japan, Fanuc America Corporation of Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA, and FANUC Europe Corporation S.A. of Luxembourg, that provide automation products and services such as robotics and computer numerical control systems. FANUC is one of the largest makers of industrial robots in the world. FANUC had its beginnings as part of Fujitsu developing early numerical control (NC) and servo systems. The company name is an acronym for Fuji Automatic NUmerical Control.[5]
In 1972, the Computing Control Division became independent and FANUC Ltd was established.[6]
FANUC is listed on the first section of Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the TOPIX 100[7] and Nikkei 225[8] stock market indices. It is headquartered in Yamanashi Prefecture.
The company's clients include US and Japanese automobile and electronics manufacturers.[which?] Use of industrial robots has allowed companies like Panasonic in Amagasaki to run factories which produce 2 million television sets a month (mostly high end plasma LCD screens including a 103 inch model) with just 25 people.[9]
FANUC has over 240 joint ventures, subsidiaries, and offices in over 46 countries.[10] It is the largest maker of CNC controls by market share with 65% of the global market.[11] and is the leading global manufacturer of factory automation systems.[12] As of 2017, FANUC holds the most patents in "Robotics" in the world.[13]

Subsidiaries and joint ventures[edit]
FANUC Europe Corporation S.A., a sister company, is headquartered in Luxembourg, with customers in Europe, and which provides sales, service and support in Europe and abroad.
FANUC America Corporation is responsible for FANUC operations in North and South America. The current incarnation, organized in 2013, unifies FANUC activities in the Americas, including the former FANUC Robotics America Corporation (1992-2013) and FANUC CNC America (2010-2013), which succeeded an earlier incarnation of FANUC America Corporation.
FANUC Robotics America Corporation (1992-2013) supplied robotic automation in North and South America, with over 240,000 robots installed. It also produced software, controls, and vision products that aid in the development of robotic systems. Headquartered in Rochester Hills, Michigan, the company had 10 regional locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The company provided these systems for applications including automotive and fabricated metals to medical devices and plastics. It was founded in 1982 as a joint venture between FANUC Ltd and General Motors Corporation, named GMFanuc Robotics Corporation. A staff of 70 began work at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. In 1992, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of FANUC Ltd of Oshino-mura, Japan. The company was a member of the Robotics Industries Association (RIA) and of the International Federation of Robotics (IFR).
In 2010, FANUC America Corporation and the prior CNC business unit from GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms in the US were combined into a new company by the name of FANUC CNC America. This business unit was a wholly owned subsidiary of FANUC Ltd. of Japan and offered CNC systems, lasers, Manufacturing Intelligence software products, field repairs and advanced technical services, expanded training classes, a vast inventory of CNC replacement parts, PCB motor repair and return, field support, and CS-24 after hours support. It was headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Illinois. It offered CNC and laser technical services, training, replacement parts, PCB and motor repair and return, field support, and after hours support. It had over 30 locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. The company provides these services to machine tool builders, machine tool dealers, and small mom and pop tool shops across a variety of industries. In 1977, the company was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of FANUC Ltd of Oshino-mura, Japan.
GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms (1986-2010) was a joint venture between General Electric and FANUC Ltd. In 2009, GE and FANUC Ltd. agreed to split, with FANUC Ltd. retaining the CNC business. GE renamed its part of the business GE Intelligent Platforms.[14][15][16]
Fanuc India operations are led by Sonali Kulkarni.
FANUC NC controller[edit]
Control / device naming conventions[edit]
Each generation of the FANUC numerical control system has different levels of device control capabilities, and these are generally referred to by a model or series number.
Each controller model is typically available with several device control capabilities, depending on what software functions are licensed for use on that device. Some common control capabilities are:

M - Milling
T - Turning (lathe)
TT - Twin Turret
P - Punch press
G - Grinding


Within each model name, there can also be generational updates for each model, usually indicated by a trailing letter.
Model 0 is somewhat unusual in that both the number zero and the letter O are used interchangeably to indicate the model.
There is no specific syntax for distinguishing the model from the device type and series, with spaces or dashes or slashes, which can result in difficulty searching for information, parts, and service for this equipment. For example, in the FANUC-0 series, these are all valid identifications for various types of NC controls and machines:[17]

NC controller capabilities[edit]
When separate computer aided manufacturing software is used to control these different systems, the model differences can be used to tell the manufacturing software how to more efficiently use the system programming capabilities. Some FANUC NC Controllers include:


Control name
Series or version
Differences and capabilities


FANUC 20

Series B
 


FANUC 30
Series A
 


FANUC 30
Series B
 


FANUC 2000
Series A
 


FANUC 3000

There is no model 4/4000, likely because it is a Japanese unlucky number. But in recent days[when?] these models are also available because of the application requirement.

FANUC Tsukuba branch


FANUC (/ˈfænʊk/; often styled Fanuc) is a group of companies, principally FANUC Corporation (ファナック株式会社, Fanakku Kabushikigaisha) of Japan, Fanuc America Corporation of Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA, and FANUC Europe Corporation S.A. of Luxembourg, that provide automation products and services such as robotics and computer numerical control systems. FANUC is one of the largest makers of industrial robots in the world. FANUC had its beginnings as part of Fujitsu developing early numerical control (NC) and servo systems. The company name is an acronym for Fuji Automatic NUmerical Control.[5]
In 1972, the Computing Control Division became independent and FANUC Ltd was established.[6]
FANUC is listed on the first section of Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the TOPIX 100[7] and Nikkei 225[8] stock market indices. It is headquartered in Yamanashi Prefecture.
The company's clients include US and Japanese automobile and electronics manufacturers.[which?] Use of industrial robots has allowed companies like Panasonic in Amagasaki to run factories which produce 2 million television sets a month (mostly high end plasma LCD screens including a 103 inch model) with just 25 people.[9]
FANUC has over 240 joint ventures, subsidiaries, and offices in over 46 countries.[10] It is the largest maker of CNC controls by market share with 65% of the global market.[11] and is the leading global manufacturer of factory automation systems.[12] As of 2017, FANUC holds the most patents in "Robotics" in the world.[13]

Subsidiaries and joint ventures[edit]
FANUC Europe Corporation S.A., a sister company, is headquartered in Luxembourg, with customers in Europe, and which provides sales, service and support in Europe and abroad.
FANUC America Corporation is responsible for FANUC operations in North and South America. The current incarnation, organized in 2013, unifies FANUC activities in the Americas, including the former FANUC Robotics America Corporation (1992-2013) and FANUC CNC America (2010-2013), which succeeded an earlier incarnation of FANUC America Corporation.
FANUC Robotics America Corporation (1992-2013) supplied robotic automation in North and South America, with over 240,000 robots installed. It also produced software, controls, and vision products that aid in the development of robotic systems. Headquartered in Rochester Hills, Michigan, the company had 10 regional locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The company provided these systems for applications including automotive and fabricated metals to medical devices and plastics. It was founded in 1982 as a joint venture between FANUC Ltd and General Motors Corporation, named GMFanuc Robotics Corporation. A staff of 70 began work at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. In 1992, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of FANUC Ltd of Oshino-mura, Japan. The company was a member of the Robotics Industries Association (RIA) and of the International Federation of Robotics (IFR).
In 2010, FANUC America Corporation and the prior CNC business unit from GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms in the US were combined into a new company by the name of FANUC CNC America. This business unit was a wholly owned subsidiary of FANUC Ltd. of Japan and offered CNC systems, lasers, Manufacturing Intelligence software products, field repairs and advanced technical services, expanded training classes, a vast inventory of CNC replacement parts, PCB motor repair and return, field support, and CS-24 after hours support. It was headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Illinois. It offered CNC and laser technical services, training, replacement parts, PCB and motor repair and return, field support, and after hours support. It had over 30 locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. The company provides these services to machine tool builders, machine tool dealers, and small mom and pop tool shops across a variety of industries. In 1977, the company was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of FANUC Ltd of Oshino-mura, Japan.
GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms (1986-2010) was a joint venture between General Electric and FANUC Ltd. In 2009, GE and FANUC Ltd. agreed to split, with FANUC Ltd. retaining the CNC business. GE renamed its part of the business GE Intelligent Platforms.[14][15][16]
Fanuc India operations are led by Sonali Kulkarni.
FANUC NC controller[edit]
Control / device naming conventions[edit]
Each generation of the FANUC numerical control system has different levels of device control capabilities, and these are generally referred to by a model or series number.
Each controller model is typically available with several device control capabilities, depending on what software functions are licensed for use on that device. Some common control capabilities are:

M - Milling
T - Turning (lathe)
TT - Twin Turret
P - Punch press
G - Grinding


Within each model name, there can also be generational updates for each model, usually indicated by a trailing letter.
Model 0 is somewhat unusual in that both the number zero and the letter O are used interchangeably to indicate the model.
There is no specific syntax for distinguishing the model from the device type and series, with spaces or dashes or slashes, which can result in difficulty searching for information, parts, and service for this equipment. For example, in the FANUC-0 series, these are all valid identifications for various types of NC controls and machines:[17]

C
number 0


NC controller capabilities[edit]
When separate computer aided manufacturing software is used to control these different systems, the model differences can be used to tell the manufacturing software how to more efficiently use the system programming capabilities. Some FANUC NC Controllers include:


Control name
Series or version
Differences and capabilities


FANUC 20
Series A
 


FANUC 20
Series B
 


FANUC 30
Series A
 


FANUC 30
Series B
 


FANUC 2000
Series A
 


FANUC 3000
Series A
 


There is no model 4/4000, likely because it is a Japanese unlucky number. But in recent days[when?] these models are also available because of the application requirement.

In 1972, the Computing Control Division became independent and FANUC Ltd was established.[6]
FANUC is listed on the first section of Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the TOPIX 100[7] and Nikkei 225[8] stock market indices. It is headquartered in Yamanashi Prefecture.
The company's clients include US and Japanese automobile and electronics manufacturers.[which?] Use of industrial robots has allowed companies like Panasonic in Amagasaki to run factories which produce 2 million television sets a month (mostly high end plasma LCD screens including a 103 inch model) with just 25 people.[9]
FANUC has over 240 joint ventures, subsidiaries, and offices in over 46 countries.[10] It is the largest maker of CNC controls by market share with 65% of the global market.[11] and is the leading global manufacturer of factory automation systems.[12] As of 2017, FANUC holds the most patents in "Robotics" in the world.[13]

Subsidiaries and joint ventures[edit]
FANUC Europe Corporation S.A., a sister company, is headquartered in Luxembourg, with customers in Europe, and which provides sales, service and support in Europe and abroad.
FANUC America Corporation is responsible for FANUC operations in North and South America. The current incarnation, organized in 2013, unifies FANUC activities in the Americas, including the former FANUC Robotics America Corporation (1992-2013) and FANUC CNC America (2010-2013), which succeeded an earlier incarnation of FANUC America Corporation.
FANUC Robotics America Corporation (1992-2013) supplied robotic automation in North and South America, with over 240,000 robots installed. It also produced software, controls, and vision products that aid in the development of robotic systems. Headquartered in Rochester Hills, Michigan, the company had 10 regional locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The company provided these systems for applications including automotive and fabricated metals to medical devices and plastics. It was founded in 1982 as a joint venture between FANUC Ltd and General Motors Corporation, named GMFanuc Robotics Corporation. A staff of 70 began work at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. In 1992, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of FANUC Ltd of Oshino-mura, Japan. The company was a member of the Robotics Industries Association (RIA) and of the International Federation of Robotics (IFR).
In 2010, FANUC America Corporation and the prior CNC business unit from GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms in the US were combined into a new company by the name of FANUC CNC America. This business unit was a wholly owned subsidiary of FANUC Ltd. of Japan and offered CNC systems, lasers, Manufacturing Intelligence software products, field repairs and advanced technical services, expanded training classes, a vast inventory of CNC replacement parts, PCB motor repair and return, field support, and CS-24 after hours support. It was headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Illinois. It offered CNC and laser technical services, training, replacement parts, PCB and motor repair and return, field support, and after hours support. It had over 30 locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. The company provides these services to machine tool builders, machine tool dealers, and small mom and pop tool shops across a variety of industries. In 1977, the company was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of FANUC Ltd of Oshino-mura, Japan.
GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms (1986-2010) was a joint venture between General Electric and FANUC Ltd. In 2009, GE and FANUC Ltd. agreed to split, with FANUC Ltd. retaining the CNC business. GE renamed its part of the business GE Intelligent Platforms.[14][15][16]
Fanuc India operations are led by Sonali Kulkarni.
FANUC NC controller[edit]
Control / device naming conventions[edit]
Each generation of the FANUC numerical control system has different levels of device control capabilities, and these are generally referred to by a model or series number.
Each controller model is typically available with several device control capabilities, depending on what software functions are licensed for use on that device. Some common control capabilities are:

M - Milling
T - Turning (lathe)
TT - Twin Turret
P - Punch press
G - Grinding


Within each model name, there can also be generational updates for each model, usually indicated by a trailing letter.
Model 0 is somewhat unusual in that both the number zero and the letter O are used interchangeably to indicate the model.
There is no specific syntax for distinguishing the model from the device type and series, with spaces or dashes or slashes, which can result in difficulty searching for information, parts, and service for this equipment. For example, in the FANUC-0 series, these are all valid identifications for various types of NC controls and machines:[17]

NC controller capabilities[edit]
When separate computer aided manufacturing software is used to control these different systems, the model differences can be used to tell the manufacturing software how to more efficiently use the system programming capabilities. Some FANUC NC Controllers include:


Control name
Series or version
Differences and capabilities


FANUC 20
Series A

Series B
 


FANUC 30
Series A
 


FANUC 30
Series B
 


FANUC 2000
Series A
 


FANUC 3000

 ROBOCUT

The FANUC ROBOCUT, is a high reliability, high performance wire cut electric discharge machine with FANUC standard CNC FS 31i-WB.


World’s highest cutting speed of 330 mm sqr/min. with economical brass wire of dia. 0.3 mm
High precision cutting delivers very precise dimensional accuracies:
                            

Roundness of 1.2 Microns for a 30 mm Dia. 50 mm thickness hole cutting
Surface finish of Ra 0.1 micron
Wire breakage reduced up to 40% as cutting energy is kept uniform during cutting and wire tension is controlled by two servo motors


Cost of the consumables such as wire, filters are lesser by 20% compared to any other similar machine available in market


Thus, this compact size machine can not only do cutting with almost twice the cutting speed as compared to other machines but is also highly accurate and economical. This machine is best suitable for all kinds of high accuracy jobs with 0.1 Ra , larger taper cutting applications, PCD cutting , medical parts, Die parts etc.

Key Features:
This feature preci This feature preci This feature precisely counts the effective discharge pulses per unit time. The intelligence of the machine counts the pulses, which are actually contributing in the cutting, and the pulses, which are not contributing in the cutting. Accordingly to maximize the efficiency, the feed is controlled in Nanometer.


Machine Base Structure: The mechanical part is independent of the electric part and the water tank. The machine is not affected by the heat of the electrical components and the temperature changes in the water tank. There are no mechanical stresses from the electrical part or water tank.
Artificial Intelligence Pulse Control (PATENTED): This feature precisely keeps count of the effective discharge pulses per unit time. The intelligence of the machine counts the pulses, which are actually contributing in the cutting, and the pulses which are not contributing in the cutting. In order to maximize the efficiency, the feed is controlled in Nanometer. This ensured the achieving desired cutting results every time. This technology is only available in FANUC Wire CUT EDM
Nano Interpolation: Nano interpolation enables the CNC to distribute positioning commands more accurately with a pitch of 0.001μm (1 Nanometer, 1000th part of 1 micron). In accordance with these commands, the servo motor equipped with the ultra-high resolution of 16 million pulse coder feeds all machine axes accurately for positioning. This excellent FANUC CNC and servo system achieves very high precision cutting.
Core Joint Function: Newly introduced Core joint function to avoid core (slug) falling down and damaging the lower nozzle.
Single Source Supply: The Hardware such as CNC Control System, Servo Motors and other electrical parts are from single source i.e. FANUC Ltd., Japan. The Software with innovative, powerful and advance features is also from FANUC Ltd. The machine is also from FANUC Ltd.



Other advanced features:
FANUC Series 31i-B CNC control with a 15" large LCD touch screen, USB device as standard, twin servo wire tension control (reduces tension variation to 1/4th of conventional machining), Inverter controlled water temperature management, Servo water level control, Thermal insulation structure, AI Corner Control where wire slack is immediately removed before a corner to deliver precise corners without changing cutting path. U-V axis with a stroke of +/- 60 mm helps to generate large tapers on a thick workpiece. Use of symmetrical casting structure, Pre-Sealing mechanism and Use of Die Guide etc. had contributed to machine performance.
This Submerged, compact size, Electrolysis AC cutting machine has excellent rust and corrosion protection effects, greatly reducing damaged layers in comparison with DC cutting. This prevents decrease in hardness of the discharge-cut surface and greatly improves the life of the Die.

                                    FANUC LTD.
Established in 1972. In 1974, industrial robot was developed in-house and put into operation in the company. The head office was moved to the foot of Mt. Fuji in 1984. In addition to industrial robots, CNC (computer numerical control), servo motors, electric injection molding machines, etc are among their main product lineup. 
Machining System using Intelligent Robots to Perform Lomg Continuous Hours of Machining Operation
“Robot Cell” developed by the company making full use of the latest intelligent robot technology is a system in which operations conventionally conducted by human hands are replaced by robots such as mounting work piece materials on the machining fixture, washing after the process, unloading from the fixture, etc. The intelligent robots are equipped with “vision sensor” functioning like a human eye and “servo hand” playing role of a hand, so that, for the first time, robots are capable of mounting a variety of work piece materials accurately on the machining fixture. Using this system, the robot will conduct machining all by itself, taking work pieces from the stock in an automatic warehouse, placing them on the fixture and completing the process. Only one maintenance and inspection operator suffices for long hours of continuous operation, realizing substantial cost cutting compared to a conventional system.
