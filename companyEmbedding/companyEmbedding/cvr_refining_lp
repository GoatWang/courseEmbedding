About CVR Refining

















Who We Are

                            Headquartered in Sugar Land, Texas, CVR Refining is an independent downstream energy limited partnership formed by CVR Energy,

Strategic Location

Strategically located refineries with advantageous access to crude oil supply. The Midcontinent locations of
                            CVR Refining’s refineries and logistics businesses gives us access to lower cost Midcontinent domestic sweet and sour and various light and
                            heavy grade Canadian crude oils, allowing us to improve our realized margins. Historically, we have purchased crude oil at a discount to WTI
                            as a result of our location. More recently, the increase of the discount at which a barrel of WTI traded relative to Brent has allowed refineries,
                            such as ours, that are capable of sourcing and utilizing crude oil that is priced by reference to WTI, to realize relatively lower crude oil
                            costs and benefit from the refined product prices resulting from higher Brent prices.
                        


Competitive Cost Advantages

Our supporting petroleum businesses provide competitive cost advantages. CVR Refining’s network of pipelines,
                            crude oil transport business and storage facilities allow us to source domestically-produced sweet and sour crude oils to our refineries in
                            a price-advantaged manner. Since 2005, our management team has grown our local gathering system from 7,000 barrels per day to today’s approximate
                            65,000 barrels per day, and it now supplies approximately 25 percent of our refineries’ crude.
                        


Attractive Supply and Demand Dynamics

We enjoy attractive refined products' supply and demand dynamics. CVR Refining’s refineries are located in the
                            cost-advantaged area of the PADD II region known as Group 3. Our combined production capacity represents approximately 22 percent of our region’s
                            refining capacity. Since the mid-1990s, demand for refined products in the PADD II region has exceeded regional production, resulting in a need
                            for imports from other regions. We benefit from the fact that the market prices in our region typically
                            include a premium equivalent to the logistics cost for other suppliers to ship products into our region.
                        


Substantial Refinery Operating Flexibility

We have substantial operating flexibility at our refineries. Since June 2005, the variety of crude grades we
                            are able to process at our Coffeyville refinery have been significantly expanded. We also have increased the variety of crude grades that the
                            Wynnewood refinery can process since we purchased the refinery in December 2011. Plans are in place to upgrade a hydrocracker unit at the Wynnewood
                            refinery, which will give us greater flexibility.
                        

                            Our proximity to, and substantial storage capacity at, the crude oil trading hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, minimizes the likelihood
                            of an interruption to our supply and facilitates optimal crude oil purchasing and blending. CVR Refining also maintains 35,000 barrel per day
                            capacity on the Spearhead and Keystone pipelines from Canada to Cushing and operates an approximately 65,000 barrel per day crude gathering system serving
                            Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, Colorado and Texas. Our crude gathering system allows us to acquire quality crudes at a discount to WTI. This combination
                            of access to price-advantaged domestic and Canadian crude oils allows us to capitalize on changing market conditions and optimize our crude
                            oil supply.
                        


Strong Refinery Operating Track Record

We have a strong refinery operating track record. CVR Refining invests millions in its facilities to ensure efficient,
                            safe and reliable operations. Since 2005, we have invested more than $700 million to modernize our Coffeyville refinery and to meet more stringent
                            federal and state environmental, health and safety requirements. As a result of these investments, we have achieved significant increases in
                            our Coffeyville refinery crude throughput rate from less than 90,000 barrels per stream day prior to June 2005 up to approximately 125,000 barrels
                            per stream day in the fourth quarter of 2013.
                        

                            We also invested more than $100 million in the Wynnewood refinery’s 2012 fall turnaround—our first turnaround since purchasing the refinery in December 2011—which will help to ensure operational reliability and safety.
                        


Synergistic Relationship with CVR Partners

Our relationship with CVR Partners provides CVR Refining with a number of operational advantages. We have the
                            ability to purchase hydrogen from CVR Partners’ nitrogen fertilizer facility in Coffeyville, which provides an important hydrogen supply redundancy
                            to our Coffeyville refinery. We also share a number of utilities with CVR Partners, such as steam and water utilities, which reduces the direct
                            operating expenses of running our Coffeyville refinery. In addition, pursuant to a long-term agreement, CVR Partners purchases 100 percent of
                            the petroleum coke that we produce at our Coffeyville refinery, thereby assuring a guaranteed source of demand for this by-product of our refining
                            operations.

                        barrels per calendar day (bpcd) operated by Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing in Coffeyville, Kansas, and a complex crude oil
                        refinery with a rated capacity of 70,000 bpcd operated by Wynnewood Refining Company in Wynnewood, Oklahoma. CVR Refining's subsidiaries
                        also operate and invest in supporting logistics assets, including approximately 340 miles of active owned and leased pipelines, a
                        65,000 bpcd pipeline owned and operated by a joint venture, approximately 150 crude oil transports, a network of strategically located
                        crude oil gathering tank farms, and approximately 6.4 million barrels of owned and leased crude oil storage capacity.

                        
Coffeyville  Resources Refining & Marketing, LLC


                            Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing  operates a complex full coking refinery  that processes moderately  heavy, medium
                            sulfur crude oil. The refinery, which has a rated capacity of 115,000 barrels per calendar day, predominantly produces clean
                            transportation products, such as gasoline, diesel fuels and propane.

                            Situated  approximately 100 miles from Cushing, Oklahoma, which is one of the largest  crude oil trading and storage hubs in the
                            United States, the refinery is served  by numerous pipelines, including those from Canada.

                            Our  Coffeyville refinery primarily markets to Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri,  Nebraska, Oklahoma and South Dakota for sale of
                            its unbranded products. Our  customers include petroleum refiners, convenience store operators, petroleum  jobbers, railroads and truck stops.

                            The  gasoline, diesel fuel, and natural gas liquids produced at the refinery are  distributed through Magellan’s Central and
                            Mountain pipelines and NuStar LP  pipelines. Gasoline and diesel fuel are also sold at our truck loading racks at  the Coffeyville refinery.

Wynnewood  Refining Company, LLC 


                            With a rated capacity of 70,000 barrels per calendar day in crude throughput capacity, the Wynnewood refinery provides a
                            meaningful increase in the scale and diversity of our refining operations. The Wynnewood refinery produces gasoline, diesel
                            fuel, military jet fuel, solvents and asphalt.

                            Petroleum products produced at the Wynnewood refinery are purchased by Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing.
                            Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing then sells and distributes the products to our customers.

                            Like our Coffeyville refinery, the Wynnewood refinery’s crude oil requirement is partially sourced by our crude gathering
                            operations and is located in close proximity to Cushing, Oklahoma.
                        

Coffeyville  Resources Crude Transportation, LLC 


                            Our crude gathering and logistics assets are owned by Coffeyville Resources Crude Transportation and include an approximately
                            65,000-barrel-per-day, crude oil  gathering and pipeline/trucking system located in Bartlesville and Pauls Valley, Oklahoma,
                            and Iola, Plainville and Winfield, Kansas. The gathering system is comprised of approximately 340 miles of active owned and
                            leased pipelines and associated tankage and truck  transportation facilities. Our gathering system purchases crude from
                            independent crude oil producers in Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, Colorado and Texas.

CVR Refining LP: CVR Refining Reports 2017 Second Quarter Results


Tickers:
                    CVRR 




      
        SUGAR LAND, Texas, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CVR Refining, LP (NYSE: CVRR), a refiner and marketer of petroleum fuels, today announced a second quarter 2017 net loss of $19.2 million on net sales of $1,338.2 million, compared to net income of $78.1 million on net sales of $1,164.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the 2017 second quarter was $43.1 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $84.7 million for the 2016 second quarter.
      
      
        For the first six months of 2017, net income was $47.8 million on net sales of $2,761.7 million, compared to net income of $10.1 million on net sales of $1,998.4 million for the comparable period a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of 2017 was $157.6 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $119.8 million for the first six months of 2016.
      
      
Top Company Interviews


        'CVR Refining operated well during the 2017 second quarter,' said Jack Lipinski, chief executive officer. 'The Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries posted a combined crude throughput of 213,841 barrels per day (bpd), with Coffeyville achieving a quarterly crude throughput record of 133,819 bpd.
      
      
        'Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) remain the single largest headwind we face,' Lipinski said. 'The continued volatility and extraordinarily high prices of RINs further proves that we are dealing with a manipulated and contrived market. The EPA must fix this broken system or small, independent merchant refiners will remain in financial distress and at risk of closure.'
      
      
        Consolidated Operations
      
      
        Second quarter 2017 throughputs of crude oil and all other feedstocks and blendstocks totaled 221,954 bpd. Throughputs of crude oil and all other feedstocks and blendstocks for both refineries totaled 210,488 bpd for the same period in 2016.
      
      
        Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $7.48 in the 2017 second quarter, compared to $9.56 during the same period in 2016. Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), including major scheduled turnaround expenses, per crude oil throughput barrel, for the 2017 second quarter were $4.44, compared to $4.56 in the second quarter of 2016.
      
      
        Distributions
      
      
        CVR Refining will not pay a cash distribution for the 2017 second quarter. CVR Refining is a variable distribution master limited partnership. As a result, its quarterly distributions, if any, will vary from quarter to quarter due to several factors, including, but not limited to, its operating performance, fluctuations in the prices paid for crude oil and other feedstocks, as well as the prices received for finished products, and other cash reserves deemed necessary or appropriate by the board of directors of its general partner.
      
      
        Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call
      
      
        CVR Refining previously announced that it will host its second quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call for analysts and investors on Thursday, July 27, at 1 p.m. Eastern. The Earnings Conference Call may also include discussion of the Partnership's developments, forward-looking information and other material information about business and financial matters.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
      
      
        To supplement our actual results in accordance with GAAP for the applicable periods, the Partnership also uses the non-GAAP financial measures noted above, which are reconciled to our GAAP-based results below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP results. The adjustments are provided to enhance an overall understanding of the Partnership's financial performance for the applicable periods and are indicators management believes are relevant and useful for planning and forecasting future periods.
      
      
        Refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel is a measurement calculated as the difference between net sales and cost of materials and other. Refining margin is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating our refineries' performance as a general indication of the amount above our cost of materials and other at which we are able to sell refined products. Each of the components used in this calculation (net sales and cost of materials and other) can be taken directly from our Statements of Operations. Our calculation of refining margin may differ from similar calculations of other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel, we utilize the total dollar figures for refining margin as derived above and divide by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. We believe that refining margin is important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance.
      
      
        Refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is a measurement calculated as the difference between net sales and cost of materials and other adjusted for FIFO impact. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating our refineries' performance as a general indication of the amount above our cost of materials and other (taking into account the impact of our utilization of FIFO) at which we are able to sell refined products. Our calculation of refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact may differ from calculations of other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Under our FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of our crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO impact when crude oil prices decrease.
      
      
        The calculation of refining margin and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact (each a non-GAAP financial measure), including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before (i) interest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) FIFO impact, (favorable) unfavorable; (ii) major scheduled turnaround expenses (that many of our competitors capitalize and thereby exclude from their measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA); (iii) (gain) loss on derivatives, net and (iv) current period settlements on derivative contracts. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is the starting point for our calculation of available cash for distribution. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) or cash flow from operations. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors to better understand our ability to make distributions to our common unitholders, help investors evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.
      
      
        A reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:

(1)


Represents the portion of (gain) loss on derivatives, net related to contracts that matured during the respective periods and settled with counterparties. There are no premiums paid or received at inception of the derivative contracts and upon settlement, there is no cost recovery associated with these contracts.





Available cash for distribution is not a recognized term under GAAP. Available cash should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss) or operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. In addition, available cash for distribution is not presented as, and should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity. Available cash as reported by the Partnership may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
      
      
        Available cash begins with Adjusted EBITDA reduced for cash needed for (i) debt service; (ii) reserves for environmental and maintenance capital expenditures; (iii) reserves for major scheduled turnaround expenses and (iv) to the extent applicable, reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of our general partner deems necessary or appropriate, if any. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, and other excess cash, at the discretion of the board of directors of our general partner. Actual distributions are set by the board of directors of our general partner. The board of directors of our general partner may modify our cash distribution policy at any time, and our partnership agreement does not require us to make distributions at all.
      
      
        A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Available cash for distribution is as follows:

About CVR Refining

















Who We Are

                            Headquartered in Sugar Land, Texas, CVR Refining is an independent downstream energy limited partnership formed by CVR Energy,
                            Inc., to own, operate and grow our refining and related logistics businesses.
                        

                            Our petroleum business includes a complex full coking, medium-sour crude oil refinery with a rated capacity of 115,000 barrels
                            per calendar day (bpcd) operated by Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing in Coffeyville, Kansas, and a complex crude oil
                            refinery with a rated capacity of 70,000 bpcd operated by Wynnewood Refining Company in Wynnewood, Oklahoma. CVR Refining's
                            subsidiaries also operate and invest in supporting logistics assets, including approximately 340 miles of active owned and leased pipelines,
                            a 65,000 bpcd pipeline owned and operated by a joint venture, approximately 150 crude oil transports, a network of strategically located crude oil gathering tank farms, and approximately 6.4 million
                            barrels of owned and leased crude oil storage capacity. Please click here to read more about our petroleum businesses.


                            CVR Refining, LP is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "CVRR." CVR Energy subsidiaries serve as the
                            general partner of CVR Refining and own the majority of the common units representing limited partner interests of CVR Refining.

Strategic Location

Strategically located refineries with advantageous access to crude oil supply. The Midcontinent locations of
                            CVR Refining’s refineries and logistics businesses gives us access to lower cost Midcontinent domestic sweet and sour and various light and
                            heavy grade Canadian crude oils, allowing us to improve our realized margins. Historically, we have purchased crude oil at a discount to WTI
                            as a result of our location. More recently, the increase of the discount at which a barrel of WTI traded relative to Brent has allowed refineries,
                            such as ours, that are capable of sourcing and utilizing crude oil that is priced by reference to WTI, to realize relatively lower crude oil
                            costs and benefit from the refined product prices resulting from higher Brent prices.
                        


Competitive Cost Advantages

Our supporting petroleum businesses provide competitive cost advantages. CVR Refining’s network of pipelines,
                            crude oil transport business and storage facilities allow us to source domestically-produced sweet and sour crude oils to our refineries in
                            a price-advantaged manner. Since 2005, our management team has grown our local gathering system from 7,000 barrels per day to today’s approximate
                            65,000 barrels per day, and it now supplies approximately 25 percent of our refineries’ crude.
                        


Attractive Supply and Demand Dynamics

We enjoy attractive refined products' supply and demand dynamics. CVR Refining’s refineries are located in the
                            cost-advantaged area of the PADD II region known as Group 3. Our combined production capacity represents approximately 22 percent of our region’s
                            refining capacity. Since the mid-1990s, demand for refined products in the PADD II region has exceeded regional production, resulting in a need
                            for imports from other regions. We benefit from the fact that the market prices in our region typically
                            include a premium equivalent to the logistics cost for other suppliers to ship products into our region.
                        


Substantial Refinery Operating Flexibility

We have substantial operating flexibility at our refineries. Since June 2005, the variety of crude grades we
                            are able to process at our Coffeyville refinery have been significantly expanded. We also have increased the variety of crude grades that the
                            Wynnewood refinery can process since we purchased the refinery in December 2011. Plans are in place to upgrade a hydrocracker unit at the Wynnewood
                            refinery, which will give us greater flexibility.
                        

                            Our proximity to, and substantial storage capacity at, the crude oil trading hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, minimizes the likelihood
                            of an interruption to our supply and facilitates optimal crude oil purchasing and blending. CVR Refining also maintains 35,000 barrel per day
                            capacity on the Spearhead and Keystone pipelines from Canada to Cushing and operates an approximately 65,000 barrel per day crude gathering system serving
                            Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, Colorado and Texas. Our crude gathering system allows us to acquire quality crudes at a discount to WTI. This combination
                            of access to price-advantaged domestic and Canadian crude oils allows us to capitalize on changing market conditions and optimize our crude
                            oil supply.
                        


Strong Refinery Operating Track Record

We have a strong refinery operating track record. CVR Refining invests millions in its facilities to ensure efficient,
                            safe and reliable operations. Since 2005, we have invested more than $700 million to modernize our Coffeyville refinery and to meet more stringent
                            federal and state environmental, health and safety requirements. As a result of these investments, we have achieved significant increases in
                            our Coffeyville refinery crude throughput rate from less than 90,000 barrels per stream day prior to June 2005 up to approximately 125,000 barrels
                            per stream day in the fourth quarter of 2013.
                        

                            We also invested more than $100 million in the Wynnewood refinery’s 2012 fall turnaround—our first turnaround since purchasing the refinery in December 2011—which will help to ensure operational reliability and safety.
                        


Synergistic Relationship with CVR Partners

Our relationship with CVR Partners provides CVR Refining with a number of operational advantages. We have the
                            ability to purchase hydrogen from CVR Partners’ nitrogen fertilizer facility in Coffeyville, which provides an important hydrogen supply redundancy
                            to our Coffeyville refinery. We also share a number of utilities with CVR Partners, such as steam and water utilities, which reduces the direct
                            operating expenses of running our Coffeyville refinery. In addition, pursuant to a long-term agreement, CVR Partners purchases 100 percent of
                            the petroleum coke that we produce at our Coffeyville refinery, thereby assuring a guaranteed source of demand for this by-product of our refining
                            operations.
