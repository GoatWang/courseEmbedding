Title: Member
               Company: Yacht Racing Association of Long Island Sound Inc
Job Details
               The Yacht Racing Association of Long Island Sound has been serving local racing sailors for over 100 years. From organizing championships to rating boats using the latest handicap standards, YRALIS is dedicated to promoting safe, fair and challenging sailboat racing throughout Western Long Island Sound. Today, we have over 65 member clubs, and nearly a thousand individual members. Over 700 boats are registered in the PHRF fleet, racing in both spinnaker and non-spinnaker classes. In addition, there are several offshore one-designs: J-44, J-120, J-35, J-105, J-30, J-92, J-80, Mumm 30s and Express 37s. Our member clubs and class associations provide inshore one-design competition and support learn-to-sail programs for sailors new to the sport. Top inshore one-design classes include Vanguard 15s, Etchells, Sonars, Lightnings, Flying Scots, Shields, Lasers, IODs, Ideal 18s and Interclubs. Many of our member clubs also provide learn to sail and racing programs for young sailors, through our affiliate, the Junior Sailing Association of Long Island Sound. Why Your Membership is Important:The strength of the YRA is in our members. The individuals who rate PHRF boats are the competitors who sail them and know the local conditions. The sailors who race one-design are those who develop the schedules. And, the folks who run race committee are competitors themselves. All our members work together towards one goal: to help get you out sailing, and make sure you have fun doing it. By joining the YRA as an individual member, club or class association, you will help support your fellow sailors and the work they do behind the scenes to achieve that goal.
