Firm
Starwood Property Trust, an affiliate of global private investment firm Starwood Capital Group, is the largest commercial mortgage real estate investment trust in the United States.
Amid the depths of the Great Recession, Starwood Capital recognized that traditional commercial lenders were withdrawing from the marketplace and a significant need had emerged for alternative commercial mortgage financings. In response, the Firm established Starwood Property Trust and in August 2009 took the company public (NYSE: STWD)—creating the largest blind pool company ever traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The business has since grown dramatically, and Starwood Property Trust today is the nation’s largest commercial mortgage REIT, with a market capitalization of more than $5 billion.
The company’s core business focuses on originating, acquiring, financing and managing commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate debt investments. In conjunction with Starwood Capital, Starwood Property Trust in April 2013 acquired LNR Property LLC and subsidiary LNR Partners LLC, the largest special servicer in the U.S., thus gaining significant expertise in the distressed marketplace while also adding substantial scale and sophistication to the company’s operations. In addition, Starwood Property Trust in early 2014 spun off its single-family residential operations into a new entity, Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust (NYSE: SWAY), now trading as Colony Starwood Homes (NYSE: SFR) that is listed alongside Starwood Property Trust on the New York Stock Exchange—and is one of the largest publicly traded investors, owners and operators of single-family rental homes in the U.S.
With total capital deployed since inception of over $29 billion, Starwood Property Trust continues to solidify its position as one of the world’s leading non-bank real estate finance companies.

Business Lines
We have organized Starwood Property Trust into three business segments that encompass our focus on real estate finance and investment. Our diversified model allows us to deploy capital throughout the real estate cycle, while leveraging Starwood Capital Group’s broad expertise in global real estate markets.
Real Estate Lending
Real estate lending has been Starwood Property Trust’s primary business since the company went public in 2009. With total capital deployed in our Real Estate Lending segment of over $19 billion, Starwood Property Trust has built a leading franchise in the global real estate finance market. We provide a seamless, one-stop solution for our borrowers and are able to lend for our balance sheet across the capital stack, including providing first mortgages, subordinate debt, mezzanine loans and B-notes. We also leverage Starwood Capital’s global real estate expertise across virtually every asset class to help source, structure and underwrite lending transactions.
Real Estate Investing & Servicing
Our Real Estate Investing & Servicing (REIS) segment includes our commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and commercial real estate debt investing business, our special servicing operations, and our commercial mortgage conduit platform. REIS’ market leadership position in CMBS investing and special servicing is the result of its disciplined and consistent approach to investing. Combined with extensive credit underwriting, acquisition, management and workout expertise, this approach has resulted in strong performance across multiple real estate cycles. REIS is led by a seasoned executive team that averages more than 20 years of industry experience and over 19 years with the company.
Debt Investment
Utilizing a disciplined and consistent approach, Starwood Property Trust is a leader in both CMBS and commercial real estate debt investments, deploying over $4 billion of capital since 2013. Our due diligence process supports an unmatched execution capacity—including the ability to underwrite hundreds of commercial loans within a short timeframe, utilizing personnel across the United States and deep relationships in the commercial real estate brokerage community. The company’s investment decisions are informed by a proprietary database management system that tracks over 100,000 properties around the country.
Special Servicing
Starwood Property Trust operates the world’s largest commercial mortgage special servicer, LNR Partners LLC. Backed by nearly 250 employees, LNR is the named special servicer on 23% of all CMBS transactions in the industry, representing an unpaid principal balance of $93 billion. Since inception, LNR has resolved more than 5,995 non-performing assets with a total principal balance of over $66.4 billion across all major property types. LNR has maintained a resolution rate of over 81% on over 5,995 CMBS loans—and, of those resolved loans, $47 billion (71%) were liquidated.
To enhance communication and transparency, LNR has created a centralized repository, Windows Into Our Workouts, that enables investors to access detailed information on assets serviced by LNR, resolved over the last two years or in the process of being marketed for sale.
Starwood Mortgage Capital
Starwood Mortgage Capital is Starwood Property Trust’s commercial real estate conduit loan origination platform. Starwood Mortgage Capital originates competitively priced five-, seven- and 10-year fixed-rate mortgages throughout the United States, typically ranging from $5–$100 million, that are secured by all major real estate asset classes.

Property
In 2014, Starwood Property Trust began investing in real estate assets to complement its Real Estate Lending and Real Estate Investing & Servicing segments. Starwood Property Trust’s equity investments comprise high-quality, stable real estate assets that contain a value-added element, thus allowing the company the opportunity to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. We focus on investing in properties that generate current cash-on-cash returns while also offering the potential for capital appreciation.


Edge
Starwood Property Trust occupies a unique position in the global real estate finance market, based on the following differentiators:
DEEP, HANDS-ON REAL ESTATE PERSPECTIVE
Starwood Property Trust is led by a seasoned management team that has successfully navigated multiple real estate cycles, with a track record of deploying over $29 billion of capital since the company’s inception. In addition, our affiliation with Starwood Capital allows us to capitalize upon the Firm’s 25 years of experience as a real estate investor and broad operating expertise across virtually every real estate asset class. As a result, we possess a granular understanding of real estate credit risk, and can evaluate each transaction from both a lender’s and equity investor’s perspective.
Global Reach
Starwood Property Trust benefits from a leading global sourcing engine that comes from Starwood Capital’s position as one of the largest institutional real estate investors in the world, with 9 offices in four countries. As a result, we are able to cast a wide net in the search for investment opportunities, and can selectively pursue only those that offer the most attractive potential risk/reward profiles.
One-stop shop for complex transactions
With access to multiples sources of financing and an experienced team of loan origination and syndication professionals, we can offer a customized, one-stop solution to our borrowers—in keeping with our goal of being on virtually every major commercial real estate investor’s short list of preferred lenders. Underscoring our scale, the average size of our loans since inception is approximately $90 million, and we have the ability to structure and originate loans as large as $500 million.
in-depth Distressed market knowledge
Starwood Property Trust’s acquisition of LNR Partners, the largest special servicer in the United States, greatly expanded our expertise in the distressed marketplace. We can analyze both the commercial mortgage-backed securities markets and LNR’s special servicing portfolio to identify situations where we can provide potential solutions for troubled borrowers.
an information Advantage
The expertise developed through Starwood Capital’s symbiotic business lines enhances Starwood Property Trust’s judgment throughout the underwriting process. These investment platforms provide the company with critical, bottom-up intelligence that helps set the agenda for future transactions.
Global Opportunistic Real Estate
This has been Starwood Capital’s primary business since the Firm raised its first distressed real estate fund in 1992.  In executing this strategy, the Firm enables Starwood Property Trust to participate in global investment opportunities across all real estate asset classes and positions in the capital stack that offer compelling risk-reward propositions. For example, Starwood Capital has been one of the most prolific investors in distressed debt since the Global Financial Crisis, while acquiring cash-flowing office, residential, retail, industrial and hotel assets at discounts to replacement cost.
Retail
Starwood Retail Partners manages one of the largest regional mall operating platforms in the U.S., with a portfolio of 30 properties totaling 28 million square feet of gross leasable area and almost $6 billion of gross asset value. The team seeks to capitalize on opportunities in the fast-changing retail landscape by acquiring, redeveloping and repositioning premier real estate assets in the regional mall, lifestyle and power-center sectors. Starwood Retail Partners has built strong relationships with tenants and can provide accurate operating metrics to help fine-tune asset cash flow projections.
Hotel Brand Management
SH Group is a hotel brand management company that generates significant proprietary investment opportunities for Starwood Property Trust. SH Group brings operational expertise in the areas of revenue management, marketing, food & beverage, systems and cost management to the acquisition and underwriting teams of Starwood Capital and its affiliates. SH Group is the force behind some of the most groundbreaking and dynamic hotel brands in the world, including

1 Hotels
As a lifestyle hotel brand inspired by nature, 1 Hotels cultivates the best of socially conscious design and sustainable architecture, together with extraordinary comfort and an unrivaled level of service.
Baccarat Hotels & Resorts
Drawing upon the 250-year history of the iconic French crystal maker, Baccarat Hotels & Resorts delivers a groundbreaking vision of luxury in the world’s most illustrious locales.

Residential
In 2013, Starwood Capital created TRI Pointe Homes (NYSE: TPH)—a West Coast homebuilder that merged with Weyerhaeuser’s homebuilding business in 2014 to create one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S.—which provides a unique perspective on the U.S. residential markets. Starwood Land Ventures, one the nation’s leading providers of residential sites to the homebuilding industry, offers additional insights into land valuation trends in the U.S. and their resulting impact on residential property values.
Energy Infrastructure
Starwood Energy Group specializes in energy infrastructure investments, with a focus on the natural gas and renewable power generation and transmission sectors. Through its general opportunity funds, Starwood Energy Infrastructure Fund I and II, and other affiliated investment vehicles, Starwood Energy Group manages total equity commitments of approximately $2.3 billion, and has executed transactions totaling more than $5 billion in enterprise value. The team leverages its extensive operations, development, construction, acquisition and financing expertise to provide valuable insights into this rapidly evolving industry.
Oil & Gas
Starwood Oil & Gas invests in conventional and unconventional oil & gas assets in North America, and offers a unique perspective on the dramatic transformation of the energy sector. In 2013, the group made a $35 million investment in Northeast Natural Energy to fund the Charleston, WV-based company’s acreage acquisition and development program in one of the most prolific areas of the Marcellus Shale. In 2015, the group led a $110 million investment in EagleRidge Energy, a Dallas-based oil & gas producer focused on one of the lowest-cost natural gas shale plays in Texas.


Approach
Starwood Property Trust employs its expertise and highly diversified and scalable investment platform across all facets of real estate finance to seek to generate consistent, attractive returns for shareholders. In our pursuit of this strategy, we adhere to the following principles:
Provide a One-Stop Financing Solution for Borrowers
Since our inception, we have prided ourselves on our ability to disintermediate traditional senior mortgage and mezzanine lenders by providing one-stop, combined financing in a single seamless process for borrowers. Our focus on large, customized financing solutions has helped set us apart from our competitors.
Approach Real Estate Lending from an Owner’s Perspective
Starwood Property Trust has developed a culture of underwriting real estate loans with a long-term balance-sheet perspective. We also leverage Starwood Capital Group’s 25 years of real estate investment experience when sourcing and underwriting potential transactions.
Invest Across the Real Estate Capital Structure
Starwood Property Trust’s broad wholesale asset origination, acquisition and servicing model provides the company with the flexibility and expertise to invest across the real estate capital structure to take advantage of changing dynamics at different points in the real estate cycle.
Focus on Risk Mitigation
Starwood Property Trust is highly focused on mitigating risk in its portfolio. Our strategy is built on using modest financial leverage to seek to achieve our target returns, and our floating-rate business model provides protection from higher interest rates. In addition, our position as a leading commercial special servicer provides us with a unique credit hedge against our CMBS and loan investments.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
