                           "The definitive history of the Intel Corporation--the essential company of the digital age--told through the lives of its
                              three preeminent figures: Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove. Intel has often been hailed as the most important company
                              in the world, and with good reason: While technology companies come and go, Intel remains, more than four decades after its
                              inception, a defining company of the global digital economy. The legendary inventor of the microprocessor--the single most
                              significant product in the modern world--Intel today builds the tiny "engines" that power almost every intelligent electronic
                              device on the planet. But the true story of Intel is the human story of the three geniuses behind it. In The Intel Trinity,
                              Michael S. Malone takes an unflinching look at the strengths and weaknesses each member of the trio has brought to Intel,
                              and how, without the perfect balance, the company would never have reached its current level of success. Robert Noyce, the
                              most respected high-tech figure of his generation, brought credibility (and money) to the company's founding; Gordon Moore
                              made Intel the world's technological leader; and Andy Grove relentlessly drove the company to ever-higher levels of success
                              and competitiveness. Without any one of these figures, Intel would never have achieved its historic success; with them, Intel
                              made possible the personal computer, the Internet, telecommunications, and the personal electronics revolution. Based on unprecedented
                              access to corporate archives, The Intel Trinity reveals the fascinating stories behind the company's ubiquitous products and
                              the unique business practices--including a willingness to commit to new ideas, an initiative to make bold investments in lean
                              times, and a devotion to upholding Gordon Moore's namesake law--that led Intel to consistent success unheard of elsewhere
                              in the tech world. The Intel Trinity is not just the story of Intel's legendary past; it is also an analysis of the formidable
                              challenges that lie ahead as the company struggles to maintain its dominance, its culture, and its legacy"--From book jacket

                           One of the greatest challenges facing any business today is the gap between its balance sheet and its market valuation. This
                              gap, representing the bulk of a company's true value, consists of indirect assets - organizational knowledge, customer satisfaction,
                              product innovation, employee morale, patents, and trademarks - that never appear in its financial reports. Only in the last

                           "The most momentous first meeting in modern business history took place inthe unlikely setting of a bench beside a football
                              field, between two Stanford University students in pads and helmets. A few years later in 1938, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard
                              were working out of a small garage in Palo Alto, California, building their first product, an audio oscillator. It was the
                              start not only of a legendary company but of an entire way of life in Silicon Valley - and, ultimately, our modern digital
                              age." "Others have written about the rise of Hewlett-Packard, including Packard himself in a bestselling memoir. But acclaimed
                              journalist Michael S. Malone is the first to get the full story, based on unlimited and exclusive access to corporate and
                              private archives, along with hundreds of employee interviews. Malone draws on his new material to show how some of the most
                              influential products of our time were invented, and how a culture of innovation led HP to unparalleled success for decades."
                              "He also shows what was really behind the groundbreaking management philosophy - "the HP Way"--That put people ahead of products
                              or profits. There have been attempts in recent years to discredit the HP Way as soft and outdated. But Malone argues that
                              the HP Way was a hard-nosed business philosophy that combined simple objectives, trust in employees to make the right choices,
                              and ruthless self-appraisal. It created a ferociously competitive and adaptive company - arguably the world's greatest company."--Jacket

                           A bold vision about the ways companies will adapt and be reborn in a revolutionary world where business models implode and
                              the search is on for what will work. The fate of newspapers and the music industry is a harbinger of what awaits every company:
                              an aging business model in its death throes as people wake up to the grim fact that their products and the way they deliver
                              them are out of sync not only with what customers want but how they want it. But commentator Michael Malone is back to make
                              sense of this future: Survival will require companies to be "protean"--nimble shape-shifters able to change direction and
                              identity in response to a rapidly evolving international marketplace. They must, in other words, act like perpetual entrepreneurial

                           This book is not what it seems. It appears to be about technology, but it is really about people. It looks like a history
                              book, but it is really an adventure story. Even its title is an oxymoron. The Microprocessor: A Biography was not written
                              for a select audience, but for every audience -- and especially for the general reader. The general reader, with little or
                              no understanding of electronics and computers, will find a complete overview of the microprocessor written in a style that
                              is intentionally non-technical and that takes great pains to explain complicated topics. He or she will also find, I hope,
                              an entertaining story about human ambition, greed, teamwork, feuds, and glory. - Preface

                              Instead, Siebel and Malone demonstrate the need to incorporate Sales Force Automation (SFA) within an overall philosophy that
                                 supports the sales force by fully informing sales reps to assist them in real selling, not just data recording and analysis.
                                 The authors show how this new vision, called Virtual Selling, will spearhead a new generation of SFA design to provide powerful

                              Today's markets have splintered into millions of powerful consumer communities' how can businesses adapt' It's no secret that
                                 traditional mass marketing' network television, newspapers, direct mail'is dying. Consumer markets are increasingly fragmented,
                                 even as they become more connected, transparent, and global. The future of business is about penetrating selfforming niches,
                                 from affinity groups on Facebook to thousands of satellite channels and millions of private online communities. So how can
                                 businesses reach new customers, win their trust, and earn their loyalty' Tom Hayes and Michael S. Malone urge an entirely
                                 new approach, embracing small, trust-based online groups as powerful vehicles for creating customers and gathering invaluable
                                 feedback. But what they call "marketing 3.0" isn't as simple as setting up a YouTube channel. Drawing on many case studies,
                                 the authors offer a new set of tools for a world where attention is harder than ever to capture, but even more lucrative to
                                 hold. They explain how to use social media for a new kind of marketing'bottom-up instead of top-down, personal rather than
                                 public, subtle rather than full frontal. The payoff is a return to the power of oldfashioned handselling'turbocharged by bleedingedge

                              Charlie's Place is the story of an Oklahoma homestead, settled during the Land Rush, lost during the Great Depression and
                                 restored seven decades later. It is an American tale of pioneering, loss and restoration. The narrative revolves around two
                                 memorable figures, Charlie Hasbrook and his grand-daughter, Nadiene Malone. The book follows the events that led Hasbrook
                                 to ride in the Land Rush - including three violent murders in Kansas and Oregon; then continues with desperate years on the
                                 Homestead continuing through the decades of prosperity that followed. Losing the farm to an unscrupulous banker during the
                                 Depression, teenaged Nadiene made an oath to regain the farm for her family. The last section of the book swings from Silicon
                                 Valley to New York City, to the lonely, long-abandoned Hasbrook Homestead, as Malone and her children race to save the farm
                                 buildings before they collapse from years of neglect. In the end, at nearly ninety years of age, she fulfills her promise

                           "The definitive history of the Intel Corporation--the essential company of the digital age--told through the lives of its
                              three preeminent figures: Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove. Intel has often been hailed as the most important company
                              in the world, and with good reason: While technology companies come and go, Intel remains, more than four decades after its
                              inception, a defining company of the global digital economy. The legendary inventor of the microprocessor--the single most
                              significant product in the modern world--Intel today builds the tiny "engines" that power almost every intelligent electronic
                              device on the planet. But the true story of Intel is the human story of the three geniuses behind it. In The Intel Trinity,
                              Michael S. Malone takes an unflinching look at the strengths and weaknesses each member of the trio has brought to Intel,
                              and how, without the perfect balance, the company would never have reached its current level of success. Robert Noyce, the
                              most respected high-tech figure of his generation, brought credibility (and money) to the company's founding; Gordon Moore
                              made Intel the world's technological leader; and Andy Grove relentlessly drove the company to ever-higher levels of success
                              and competitiveness. Without any one of these figures, Intel would never have achieved its historic success; with them, Intel
                              made possible the personal computer, the Internet, telecommunications, and the personal electronics revolution. Based on unprecedented
                              access to corporate archives, The Intel Trinity reveals the fascinating stories behind the company's ubiquitous products and
                              the unique business practices--including a willingness to commit to new ideas, an initiative to make bold investments in lean
                              times, and a devotion to upholding Gordon Moore's namesake law--that led Intel to consistent success unheard of elsewhere
                              in the tech world. The Intel Trinity is not just the story of Intel's legendary past; it is also an analysis of the formidable
                              challenges that lie ahead as the company struggles to maintain its dominance, its culture, and its legacy"--From book jacket

                           One of the greatest challenges facing any business today is the gap between its balance sheet and its market valuation. This
                              gap, representing the bulk of a company's true value, consists of indirect assets - organizational knowledge, customer satisfaction,
                              product innovation, employee morale, patents, and trademarks - that never appear in its financial reports. Only in the last

                           "The most momentous first meeting in modern business history took place inthe unlikely setting of a bench beside a football
                              field, between two Stanford University students in pads and helmets. A few years later in 1938, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard
                              were working out of a small garage in Palo Alto, California, building their first product, an audio oscillator. It was the
                              start not only of a legendary company but of an entire way of life in Silicon Valley - and, ultimately, our modern digital
                              age." "Others have written about the rise of Hewlett-Packard, including Packard himself in a bestselling memoir. But acclaimed
                              journalist Michael S. Malone is the first to get the full story, based on unlimited and exclusive access to corporate and
                              private archives, along with hundreds of employee interviews. Malone draws on his new material to show how some of the most
                              influential products of our time were invented, and how a culture of innovation led HP to unparalleled success for decades."
                              "He also shows what was really behind the groundbreaking management philosophy - "the HP Way"--That put people ahead of products
                              or profits. There have been attempts in recent years to discredit the HP Way as soft and outdated. But Malone argues that
                              the HP Way was a hard-nosed business philosophy that combined simple objectives, trust in employees to make the right choices,
                              and ruthless self-appraisal. It created a ferociously competitive and adaptive company - arguably the world's greatest company."--Jacket

                           A bold vision about the ways companies will adapt and be reborn in a revolutionary world where business models implode and
                              the search is on for what will work. The fate of newspapers and the music industry is a harbinger of what awaits every company:
                              an aging business model in its death throes as people wake up to the grim fact that their products and the way they deliver
                              them are out of sync not only with what customers want but how they want it. But commentator Michael Malone is back to make
                              sense of this future: Survival will require companies to be "protean"--nimble shape-shifters able to change direction and
                              identity in response to a rapidly evolving international marketplace. They must, in other words, act like perpetual entrepreneurial

                           This book is not what it seems. It appears to be about technology, but it is really about people. It looks like a history
                              book, but it is really an adventure story. Even its title is an oxymoron. The Microprocessor: A Biography was not written
                              for a select audience, but for every audience -- and especially for the general reader. The general reader, with little or
                              no understanding of electronics and computers, will find a complete overview of the microprocessor written in a style that
                              is intentionally non-technical and that takes great pains to explain complicated topics. He or she will also find, I hope,
                              an entertaining story about human ambition, greed, teamwork, feuds, and glory. - Preface

                              Instead, Siebel and Malone demonstrate the need to incorporate Sales Force Automation (SFA) within an overall philosophy that
                                 supports the sales force by fully informing sales reps to assist them in real selling, not just data recording and analysis.
                                 The authors show how this new vision, called Virtual Selling, will spearhead a new generation of SFA design to provide powerful
                                 tools - from opportunity management systems and marketing encyclopedias to product configurations and team selling across
                                 multiple distribution channels - which will enhance customer contact and heighten the effectiveness of the sales representative

                              Today's markets have splintered into millions of powerful consumer communities' how can businesses adapt' It's no secret that
                                 traditional mass marketing' network television, newspapers, direct mail'is dying. Consumer markets are increasingly fragmented,
                                 even as they become more connected, transparent, and global. The future of business is about penetrating selfforming niches,
                                 from affinity groups on Facebook to thousands of satellite channels and millions of private online communities. So how can

                                 new approach, embracing small, trust-based online groups as powerful vehicles for creating customers and gathering invaluable

                              "In business, performance is key. In performance, how you organize can be the key to growth. In the past five years, the business
                                 world has seen the birth of a new breed of company--the exponential organization--that has revolutionized how a company can
                                 accelerate its growth by using technology. An ExO can eliminate the incremental, linear way traditional companies get bigger,
                                 leveraging assets like community, big data, algorithms, and new technology into achieving performance benchmarks ten times
                                 better than its peers. Three luminaries of the business world--Salim Ismail, Yuri van Geest, and Mike Malone--have researched
                                 this phenomenon and documented ten characteristics of exponential organizations. Here, In Exponential organizations, they
                                 walk the reader through how any company, from a startup to a multi-national, can become an ExO, streamline its performance,
                                 and grow to the next level."--Back cover

                                 S. Malone beschreibt nicht allein die Herstellung und Arbeitsweise des Mikroprozessors auch in ihrer historischen Dimension,

                              Charlie's Place is the story of an Oklahoma homestead, settled during the Land Rush, lost during the Great Depression and
                                 restored seven decades later. It is an American tale of pioneering, loss and restoration. The narrative revolves around two
                                 memorable figures, Charlie Hasbrook and his grand-daughter, Nadiene Malone. The book follows the events that led Hasbrook
                                 to ride in the Land Rush - including three violent murders in Kansas and Oregon; then continues with desperate years on the
                                 Homestead continuing through the decades of prosperity that followed. Losing the farm to an unscrupulous banker during the
                                 Depression, teenaged Nadiene made an oath to regain the farm for her family. The last section of the book swings from Silicon
                                 Valley to New York City, to the lonely, long-abandoned Hasbrook Homestead, as Malone and her children race to save the farm
                                 buildings before they collapse from years of neglect. In the end, at nearly ninety years of age, she fulfills her promise
