Advisor

 

			Kirk B. Reed graduated from Villanova University with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering and a general business minor. After earning his designation as a Certified Financial Planner™, he joined his wife, Alyssa McNamara, and their family at McNamara Financial, and for the past seven years he’s been helping clients understand investments and financial planning:  “When people research financial matters on their own, they can be inundated with confusing (and often incorrect) information, which makes financial planning an overwhelming and sometimes scary task, says Kirk. His mission? “I want to simplify financial planning for the client so that they can make the best decisions and feel secure knowing they’ll have the future they want.”

Services 



At Kinship AdvisorsSM we are committed to flexibility. We prefer not to use the “one-size fits all” approach that dominates that financial advisory business. We offer three separate services, investment management, comprehensive financial planning, and hourly financial advice. Clients are free to engage us any way that they choose. And because we charge separately for each service, clients can rest assured that they are not paying for services that do not apply to them.
Investment Management Services
We believe that most investors are better off using an advisor to assist them with their investment strategy. We offer investment management services at a very reasonable price. We are able to do this because of our business structure, and the fact that we do not “throw in” planning services that you may or may not want/need. Clients may select services based on their client-identified needs, which may include:

Investment Management

Risk/return Profile Assessment
Investment Portfolio Design
Ongoing Portfolio Monitoring & Rebalancing


Investment contribution and/or distribution planning.
Ongoing administrative account services
Annual investment review meeting
Fee is based on a percentage of managed assets.

Comprehensive Financial Planning
For clients who are looking for an in-depth analysis of their entire financial life, we offer comprehensive financial planning services for an annual fee.

Cash Flow Analysis
Debt Analysis
Detailed Retirement and/or College Projections
Risk/Return Profile Assessment
Strategic Asset Allocation Recommendations
Detailed Insurance Analysis and Recommendations
Coordination with tax, insurance, and estate planning professionals
Written summary of plan and action steps
Annual planning review meeting, plus 3 quarterly check-ins.
$50 per month, minimum one-year commitment.

Targeted Financial Advice
Since comprehensive planning isn’t for everyone, we are also happy to offer targeted advice on individual topics, like retirement planning, college planning, etc. Or take a look at your financial “big picture” in less detail.
Fees for services are subject to the terms of the applicable Investment Services Agreement entered into by the client.
