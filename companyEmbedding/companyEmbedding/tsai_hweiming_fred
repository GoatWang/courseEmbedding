2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "Revenue upside indicative of strong & sustaining demand that is likely independent of temporal EPS downside. Reiterating Buy rating and 12-month price target of $43." (7/21/2017)
3. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "On Thursday, an article appeared on a tech blog highlighting a situation that arose in early 2016 between a data center customer (in this case Apple) and Super Micro. According to the article, this customer discovered what it believed was a security flaw in one of its servers provided from SMCI, returned some servers and subsequently severed its supply relationship. Given the gravity of the allegations, Super Micro published a formal response this morning. SMCI indicated that during the period in question, to the extent a security concern was raised, it was fully investigated and determined that there was 'no valid security concern' related to the Super Micro product. Why bring up this situation, which was apparently resolved and occurred over a year ago, at this time? Clearly, Apple was never a top ten customer, and with no actual issue we don't believe any disclosure would have been required nor expected. In our view, the proper response for investors is to capitalize on any downdraft that could occur from such 'reporting' and buy the dip. We reiterate our Buy and $33 target." (2/24/2017)
4. Susquehanna Bancshares Inc analysts commented, "SMCI is executing well on its Enterprise strategy, and we are encouraged with the strong Mar Q guide ahead of a meaningful product cycle in 2HCY17 as well as continued growth in its next-gen storage business." (1/27/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.83)Consensus Price Target: $32.17 (20.02% upside)
