      Fitch to Rate JPMDB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2016 C2;

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on JPMDB Commercial Mortgage 
      Securities Trust 2016-C2 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$23,342,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$160,394,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$43,524,000a class D 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17,856,000a class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$12,276,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$36,828,383 class NR.
    

      a)Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b)Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of April 26, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 30 loans secured by 79 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $892,799,383 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JP Morgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association and German American Capital Corporation.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 86% of the properties by balance and asset 
      summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 92% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Low Fitch Leverage: This transaction has lower leverage than other 
      Fitch-rated transactions. The Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      for the trust is 1.26x, while the YTD 2016 and 2015 averages are 1.17x 
      and 1.18x, respectively. The Fitch loan-to-value (LTV) for the trust is 
      99.9%, which is lower than both the respective YTD 2016 and 2015 
      averages of 107.9% and 109.3%. Excluding the credit-opinion loans (10.1% 
      of the pool), the Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.21x and 105.1%, respectively.
    

      Concentrated Pool with Low Loan Count: The pool is more concentrated 
      than other recent Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The top 10 
      loans comprise 59.5% of the pool, which is above recent averages of 
      55.8% for YTD 2016 and above the 2015 average of 49.3%. Additionally, 
      the loan concentration index (LCI) and sponsor concentration index (SCI) 
      are 481 and 653, respectively, above 2015 averages of 367 and 410.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: The transaction has two credit 
      opinion loans, totaling 10.1% of the pool. 787 Seventh Ave (6.7% of the 
      pool) is the third largest loan in the transaction and has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB+sf' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Palisades Center (3.4% of the pool) is the 14th largest loan in the 
      transaction and has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'AAsf' on a 
      stand-alone basis. Excluding these loans, the conduit has a Fitch 
      stressed DSCR of 1.21x and LTV 105.1%, respectively. The implied credit 
      enhancement levels for the conduit portion of the transaction rated 
      'AAAsf' and 'BBB-sf' are 23.875% and 8.375%, respectively.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 15% below the most 
      recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMDB 2016-C2 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young, LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary (RAC).

      for the trust is 1.26x, while the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 and 2015

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 15% below the most

Wells Fargo Mortgage Loans Review 2017

Finding the Right Mortgage, Mortgages




You can trust that we maintain strict editorial integrity in our writing and assessments; however, we receive compensation when you click on links to products from our partners and get approved. Here's how we make money.

Wells Fargo Mortgage is the 800-pound gorilla of home loans. But standing next to this gorilla is a big elephant in the room.
Wells Fargo has been the leading originator and servicer of residential mortgages for 24 out of the past 25 years. The bank has a loan product selection that is long and wide. Last year, it financed one of every eight home loans in America.
‘We’re not a perfect company. We made a mistake’
But in 2016, Wells Fargo suffered a costly and embarrassing corporate setback. After news spread that thousands of employees set up as many as 2 million unauthorized customer accounts in a five-year cross-selling scheme, the bank is struggling to regain consumer confidence.
And on Oct. 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $50 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit alleging the bank overcharged 250,000 customers for mortgage appraisal fees.
“Wells Fargo is a great company, and it’s been a great company for over 160 years,” says Greg Gwizdz, national sales manager for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. “But we’re not a perfect company. We made a mistake. And I think it has been well documented that we have made corrections based on that mistake.”
He says the bank has changed its compensation policies, given refunds to customers, reviewed sales practices and “taken steps to change the organization to make sure that that doesn’t happen again.”
If you’re considering Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, here’s what you need to know.

NerdWallet's rating: 3.5 / 5


AT A GLANCEA full range of traditional and specialty mortgages.Minimum credit score of 620, though alternative credit data may be considered for certain loan products.A first-time homebuyer program allows down payments as low as 3% plus “expanded credit criteria.”




Get started 





Compare Wells Fargo with other lenders.
A full product mortgage lender
Wells Fargo offers the extended list of mortgage products you’d expect from a “big box” lender. Beyond conventional mortgages, home equity lines of credit and government loans from the Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Affairs and Department of Agriculture, Wells Fargo Mortgage offers:

Jumbo loans on up to 89.9% of a home’s value, with support provided by a specialized private mortgage banking team.
Renovation loans, with financing based on after-home-improvement value built into purchase or refi loans.
New construction home loans, with options for an extended rate lock during the building period.
Relocation and employee mortgage programs for many large companies.
A loan program with special benefits for eligible union members.

The Union Plus Mortgage program is available to 59 national and international labor unions and 30,000 local unions. Participants get a $500 award card on a purchase loan or a $300 award card on a refinance. “If you [become] disabled, unemployed or your union goes on strike, you can apply for a grant and interest-free loan to make your mortgage payment,” Gwizdz says.
Programs for first-time or declined homebuyers
Wells Fargo’s yourFirst Mortgage offers down payments as low as 3% on fixed-rate mortgages, expanded credit criteria and incentives for homebuyer education.
“From a credit perspective, this would be [considering] things like utility bills and other forms of credit, in addition to just a standard credit report,” Gwizdz says. “And we provide an eighth lower interest rate (0.125%) if consumers go through our homebuyer education classes.”
Gwizdz says these classes aren’t for learning about mortgages and the mortgage process. “It’s really learning about being a homeowner and understanding everything that comes with that: the taxes and the insurance and the maintenance — and saving money because, guess what, the furnace is going to break, and the roof is going to leak.”
Meanwhile, the My Home Roadmap program offers free credit counseling for customers who have been turned down for credit or have decided not to apply for a mortgage. It offers a referral for up to two hours of free counseling with a certified credit counselor to discuss your situation.

Wells Fargo mortgage process
You can’t get a prequalification or complete a mortgage application online at Wells Fargo. While the bank’s website offers some affordability tools, educational videos and national mortgage rates, that’s pretty much as far as you can go online.
Once you’re ready to make an application, you can sign into yourLoanTracker, the online bridge between you and your Wells Fargo Mortgage loan advisor. After you apply in person or over the phone, this is where you can track your application’s status and exchange information and documents via computer or mobile device. There are also e-signature capabilities.
Even though the lending process and timeline are typical, the online interface can save a lot of the time you otherwise might spend on taking or mailing documents to a loan office.
Gwizdz says technology upgrades are in the works, with “full online capabilities” coming soon.

What Wells Fargo does best

Wells Fargo offers a deep product bench for borrowers at every financial stage in life.
Specialty loan programs target first-time homebuyers, union members and others.
While some other large banks are growing wary of mortgage lending, Wells Fargo maintains a dominant position.

Where Wells Fargo falls short

Borrowers can’t yet apply for a mortgage online.
With a long list of government actions, the embattled bank has an uphill climb to regain consumer trust.

Wells Fargo has a world-class selection of mortgage products and deep resources for customers to draw upon, but the fact remains that this bank has a lot of baggage. While employees are putting on brave faces and working to regain trust, homebuyers may find it hard to put their largest purchase in the hands of Wells Fargo Mortgage.
“What I say to my team is, ‘At this point, our actions have to speak louder than our words,'” Gwizdz says. “And all we can do is continue to provide great service to all of our customers and give it some time, and we believe we’ll win back the trust of our customers. But we have to earn it back.”

The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association and German American Capital Corporation.Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including site inspections on 79.6% of the properties by balance, cash flow analysis of 90.9%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.KEY RATING DRIVERSFitch Leverage is Below 2016 YTD Average: The pool has lower leverage than other Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV for the trust are 1.23x and 102.4%, respectively, while the 2016 YTD averages are 1.19x and 105.8%. Excluding credit-opinion loans, the pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.16x and 113.2%, respectively.High Percentage of Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four loans in the pool, representing 20.1%, have investment-grade credit opinions, well above the 2016 YTD average of 7.4%. The two largest loans in the pool, 9 West 57th Street (7.1%) and 10 Hudson Yards (7.1%), have investment-grade credit opinions of 'AAAsf'* and 'BBBsf'*, respectively, on a stand-alone basis. Moffett Gateway (3.8%), the ninth largest loan in the pool, has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf'* on a stand-alone basis. Furthermore, Westfield San Francisco Centre (2.1%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf'* on a stand-alone basis. The implied credit enhancement levels for the conduit portion of the transaction of 'AAAsf' and 'BBB-sf' are 26.750% and 9.125%, respectively.Concentrated Pool by Loan Size: The 10 largest loans account for 51.9% of the pool by balance, compared to the 2016 YTD average of 54.7%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 398, which is lower than the 2016 YTD average of 421.RATING SENSITIVITIESFor this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.1% below the most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMDB 2016-C4 certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A+sf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could occur. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities on page 12.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
