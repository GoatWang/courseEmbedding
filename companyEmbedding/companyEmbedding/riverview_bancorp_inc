Zacks Rank:

Style Scores:



B Value | C Growth | F Momentum | C VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

VANCOUVER, Wash., July  05, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Riverview Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:RVSB) ("Riverview" or the "Company") today announced it was added to the Russell 3000 Index® and Russell 2000® Index when Russell Investments reconstituted its comprehensive set of U.S. and global equity indexes on June 26, 2017.
"We are pleased to be added to the Russell 2000, which reflects our continued positive momentum and efforts to increase shareholder value," said Pat Sheaffer, Chairman and CEO of the Company.  "We expect our inclusion will raise our profile and generate greater interest in our stock among institutional investors."
Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for both index funds and as benchmarks for passive and active investment strategies.  In the U.S. marketplace, approximately 99% of the U.S. equity assets are benchmarked by the Russell 3000, representing more than $8.5 trillion.  The Company will hold its membership until FTSE Russell reconstitutes its indexes in June 2018.
The annual reconstitution of the Russell 3000 captures the 3,000 largest U.S. stocks as of the end of May, ranking them by total market capitalization.  The largest 1,000 companies in this ranking comprise the Russell 1000 and the next 2,000 companies become the Russell 2000.
The Russell 3000 also serves as the U.S. component to the Russell Global Index, which Russell launched in 2007. 
About RiverviewRiverview Bancorp, Inc. (www.riverviewbank.com) is headquartered in Vancouver, Washington - just north of Portland, Oregon on the I-5 corridor.  With assets of $1.13 billion, it is the parent company of the 94 year-old Riverview Community Bank, as well as Riverview Trust Company.  The Bank offers true community banking services, focusing on providing the highest quality service and financial products to commercial and retail customers. There are 19 branches, including 14 in the Portland-Vancouver area and three lending centers.

This press release contains statements that the Company believes are "forward-looking statements."  These statements relate to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance or business.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties.  When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements the Company may make.  Moreover, you should treat these statements as speaking only as of the date they are made and based only on information then actually known to the Company.

About FTSE RussellFTSE Russell is a global index leader that provides innovative benchmarking, analytics and data solutions for investors worldwide.  FTSE Russell calculates thousands of indexes that measure and benchmark markets and asset classes in more than 70 countries, covering 98% of the investable market globally.
FTSE Russell index expertise and products are used extensively by institutional and retail investors globally.  Approximately $10 trillion is currently benchmarked to FTSE Russell indexes.  For over 30 years, leading asset owners, asset managers, ETF providers and investment banks have chosen FTSE Russell indexes to benchmark their investment performance and create ETFs, structured products and index-based derivatives.
A core set of universal principles guides FTSE Russell index design and management:  a transparent rules-based methodology is informed by independent committees of leading market participants.  FTSE Russell is focused on applying the highest industry standards in index design and governance, and embraces the IOSCO principles.  FTSE Russell is also focused on index innovation and client collaboration as it seeks to enhance the breadth, depth and reach of its offering.
