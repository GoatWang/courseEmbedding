Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                Your Trust Is Our Most Important Investment.
              

World-Class Investment Products ... Integrity ... Sound Financial Advice ...
$ During retirement, the last thing you want to worry about is outliving your money. York Capital Management, LLC ("YCM") can provide the peace of mind that comes with having a professional navigate the ongoing challenges your investments must face both before and during retirement. Located in Denver, Colorado, YCM offers comprehensive investment management and retirement planning programs as well as consultation services involving estate, inheritance, legacy, health care and college savings issues.
Many investors don't have the time or expertise to make all their own investment decisions, so having a professional on your side can be crucial. As investors look for guidance in these troubled and volatile markets, one question looms large: Who can you trust? 
 
To discover whether a financial advisor is trustworthy and reliable, investors need to put them through a tough vetting process to make sure they're competent, reliable and looking after your best interests. The bedrock of YCM's solid reputation over the past 14 years has been built on its unwavering committment to provide trustworthy advice and competent investment management. A professionally diversified investment plan with YCM will also help you simplify complex pre-retirement and post-retirement affairs involving wealth managment. Retirees need stable and predictable income streams to pay for expenses yet they also need some investment growth to keep up with rising costs in living and health care.
 
Deciding which investment assets to tap first and how much can be instrumental to extending the life of your money.   For today's active retirees with increasing life expectancies, this dual growth & income strategy is seen as an essential safeguard for capital growth and capital preservation . As an independent, fee-only Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), YCM's compensation comes solely from a management fee which eliminates conflicts of interest that are inherent with compensation based on sales commissions. Our client services are personalized to promote an investment partnership based on commitment, integrity and accomplishment. Your personal circumstances, age, goals, time horizons, performance expectations, attitudes about risk, liquidity requirements and tax implications will shape a portfolio strategy designed to provide retirement security. YCM's broker/custodian, Charles Schwab & Co., safeguards client accounts and offers a full range of world class investment products and services.Call today for a complimentary, no obligation "Get Acquainted" meeting, and begin your financial planning for achieving retirement peace of mind and financial security!$ Review this website to learn more about YCM's professionally managed and diversifed investment philosophy and services. Also, a wealth of investment and retirement planning articles, financial calculators, market statistics, tax information, glossary terms and much more are easily accessible.
