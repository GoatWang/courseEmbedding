Cloud Solutions 




Reap the benefits of the cloud with the right cloud solutions.
The cloud holds the potential to help enterprises reduce cost, improve agility, optimize operations and compete more effectively – but only when the right cloud solutions are in the mix.
Managing cloud platforms, cloud storage and cloud-based applications are not simple tasks -- especially for IT teams that lack the resources and tools to do it well. Third-party cloud solutions providers can help by enabling organizations to offload implementation, management and maintenance of cloud infrastructure to experts who can handle it with greater efficiency and effectiveness.
The key is choosing the right provider. When your mission-critical applications, data, systems and infrastructure are in the hands of a cloud services provider, you have to be sure you've made the right selection when choosing a partner. That's why, when leading companies across a wide range of industries perform a cloud assessment, they end up turning to cloud solutions from Navisite.

Improve reliability and availability with cloud solutions that are backed by 24/7/365 client support and industry-leading service level agreements (SLAs).

Solutions 




By design, each of Navisite’s services works to address a unique business need. When enterprises combine various Navisite offerings, they can create more-comprehensive business solutions to help meet complex, multi-faceted demands. Here, we explore some of the challenges facing select industries and use cases and how Navisite’s portfolio can help enterprises to overcome them.
 

 

Solutions






 

Moving Legacy Apps to the Cloud
  Cloud computing can present many benefits to organizations, yet migrating large amounts of application data, at once, is often infeasible. Navisite can help enable a simplified, secure extension into the Cloud.
  

 

Managed Data Protection
  Whether your workloads and data are deployed on bare metal, public cloud, private cloud or a hybrid of all three, your digital assets on Navisite servers and storage environments can be protected by one Managed Data Protection solution.
  

 

Fitting Unique, Legacy Systems into a Cloud Migration Strategy
  An inability to fit legacy servers or software into a cloud migration can delay or cancel the migration. By combining Colocation with Cloud Services, clients can support their unique systems, while transitioning the majority of workloads to the Cloud.
  

 

SaaS for ISVs
  Navisite can  help Independent  Software Vendors leverage cloud-enabled IaaS and DaaS to provide Software-as-a-Service, while better matching resource capacities with demand and mitigating up-front CapEx.
  

 

Productivity Solutions For a Virtualized Workforce
  Navisite can empower organizations with a diverse remote and mobile workforce by delivering flexible Desktop-as-a-Service capabilities from VMware with familiar Microsoft Office 365 tools enhanced with rapid, dedicated support and managed onboarding.
  

 

NaviCloud DaaS for Higher Education
  Cloud-enabled virtual desktops can often better position education institutions to innovate and remain competative via support for security, seasonal demand, BYOD initiatives and more--all with no associated, up-front CapEx.
  

 

Secure Mobility for a Productive Workforce
  Navisite can empower organizations with distinct mobility requirements by delivering secure Enterprise Mobility Management capabilities from VMware with familiar Microsoft Office 365 tools enhanced with rapid, dedicated support and managed onboarding.
  

 

Oracle Demantra Management
  Oracle’s Demantra can aid in developing demand forecasts and streamlining operational planning cycles, but keeping the solution up-to-date can prove challenging. Maintaining Demantra in-house can often feel like a full-time responsibility.
  

 

Cloud Services for Healthcare Providers
  Rising costs, patient expectations and regulations are all driving healthcare organizations to improve on care and patient privacy while minimizing spending. Legacy IT infrastructures can prevent organizations from adapting quickly and efficiently.
  

 

Cloud Services for Higher Education
  Higher education institutions need to boost innovation, while guaranteeing security and complying with industry standards. Faced with tight budgets and variable demands, many intuitions are looking for a scalable, pay-as-you-go solution.
  

 

Managed Application Services for Healthcare
  In the healthcare Industry, technology and regulatory standards are constantly evolving. Navisite’s Managed Application Services (MAS) can help healthcare organizations remain competitive, while maintaining focus on reliability, security and compliance.
  

 

SQL Server Database Management
  Database technologies are key to cataloging critical, sensitive data. It can be difficult to maintain the integrity of these essential technologies, often exposing business-critical data to compromise.
  

 

Oracle ERP Management
  ERP system maintenance can be difficult and time-consuming. To adhere to evolving compliance standards, IT teams must frequently implement patches and updates. Provisioning end-users with the latest capabilities is a further strain on IT resources.
  

 

Healthcare Data Security and Accessibility
  Healthcare organizations must enable untethered access to digital assets without compromising on security. Amidst public alarm around data breaches, Healthcare groups must resolve to protect sensitive resources without detriment to operations.
