In this article, the author reviews and synthesizes the varying definitions of product quality arising from philosophy, economics, marketing, and operations management. He then goes on to build an eight­-dimensional framework to elaborate on these definitions. Using this framework, he addresses the empirical relationships between quality and variables such as price, advertising, market share, cost, and profitability.

Product quality is rapidly becoming an important competitive issue. The superior reliability of many Japanese products has sparked considerable soul-searching among American managers.1 In addition, several surveys have voiced consumers' dissatisfaction with the existing levels of quality and service of the products they buy.2 In a recent study of the business units of major North American companies, managers ranked “producing to high quality standards” as their chief current concern.3
Despite the interest of managers, the academic literature on quality has not been reviewed extensively. The problem is one of coverage: scholars in four disciplines — philosophy, economics, marketing, and operations management — have considered the subject, but each group has viewed it from a different vantage point. Philosophy has focused on definitional issues; economics, on profit maximization and market equilibrium; marketing, on the determinants of buying behavior and customer satisfaction; and operations management, on engineering practices and manufacturing control. The result has been a host of competing perspectives, each based on a different analytical framework and each employing its own terminology.
At the same time, a number of common themes are apparent. All of them have important management implications. On the conceptual front, each discipline has wrestled with the following questions: Is quality objective or subjective? Is it timeless or socially determined? Empirically, interest has focused on the correlates of quality. What, for example, is the connection between quality and price? Between quality and advertising? Between quality and cost? Between quality and market share? More generally, do quality improvements lead to higher or lower profits?

Five Approaches to Defining Quality
Five major approaches to the definition of quality can be identified: (1) the transcendent approach of philosophy; (2) the product-based approach of economics; (3) the user-based approach of economics, marketing, and operations management; and (4) the manufacturing-based and (5) value-based approaches of operations management. Table 1 presents representative examples of each approach.



Table 1: Five Definitions of Quality 
I.	Transcendent Definition:

"Quality is neither mind nor matter, but a third entity independent of the two ... even though Quality cannot be defined, you know what it is." (R. M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, pp. 185, 213) 
" ... a condition of excellence implying fine quality as distinct from poor quality .... Quality is achieving or reaching for the highest standard as against being satisfied with the sloppy or fraudulent."

					4 Comments On: What Does "Product Quality" Really Mean?				


Dileep Dandge			| February 19, 2014


Although so much has been studied, researched, and reported on Quality over the past 30 years, Mr. David Garvin’s articled published in 1984 is still refreshing! Amazing!



max dullo			| August 1, 2014


great summary, really appreciated this “quality” portfolio!



Kasawuli John			| October 2, 2015


This is surely a fine piece of work and quite relevant in respect of understanding the quality concept in spite of being published many years ago.



Mike Cunningham			| May 23, 2016


Brilliant article Mr. Garvin and extremely helpful for my challenge of improving ‘product quality’ at a low volume high diversity electronics CM, here in the Netherlands. Having worked as a quality engineer in China for more than 10 years, I have experienced all 8 dimensions of quality, but until now, never properly appreciated how important it was that the strategy that reflects its most important quality targets, as catagorised in your article. I will ask my customers, what is important to them, and act accordingly.

Eight dimensions of quality

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Eight dimensions of product quality management can be used at a strategic level to analyze quality characteristics. The concept was defined by David A. Garvin. Some of the dimensions are mutually reinforcing, whereas others are not—improvement in one may be at the expense of others. Understanding the trade-offs desired by customers among these dimensions can help build a competitive advantage. Garvin's eight dimensions can be summarized as follows:[1]

Performance: Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes; brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance.
Features: Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user.
Reliability: Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail.
Conformance: Conformance is the precision with which the product or service meets the specified standards.
Durability: Durability measures the length of a product’s life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly.
Serviceability: Serviceability is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the serviceperson.
Aesthetics: Aesthetics is the subjective dimension indicating the kind of response a user has to a product. It represents the individual’s personal preference.
Perceived Quality: Perceived Quality is the quality attributed to a good or service based on indirect measures.

Performance[edit]
Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes, so brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance. Overall performance rankings, however, are more difficult to develop, especially when they involve benefits that not every consumer needs. Performance is often a source of contention between customers and suppliers, particularly when deliverables are not adequately defined within specifications. The performance of a product often influences the profitability or reputation of the end-user. As such, many contracts or specifications include damages related to inadequate performance. The question of whether performance differences are quality differences may depend on circumstantial preferences-but preferences based on functional requirements, not taste. Some performance standards are based on subjective preferences, but the preferences are so universal that they have the force of an objective standard.[2]
Features[edit]
Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user.
Similar thinking can be applied to features, a second dimensions of quality that is often a secondary aspects of performance. Features are the "bells and whistles" of products and services, those characteristics that supplement their basic functioning. Examples include free drinks on a plane, permanent-press cycles on a washing machine, and automatic tuners on a color television set. The line separating primary performance characteristics from secondary features is often difficult to draw.[2]
Reliability[edit]
Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail.
This dimension reflects the probability of a product malfunctioning or failing within a specified time period. Among the most common measures of reliability are the mean time to first failure, the mean time between failures, and the failure rate per unit time. Because these measures require a product to be in use for a specified period, they are more relevant to durable goods than to products and services that are consumed instantly.
Reliability normally becomes more important to consumers as downtime and maintenance become more expensive. Farmers, for example, are especially sensitive to downtime during the short harvest season. Reliable equipment can mean the difference between a good year and spoiled crops. But consumers on other markets are more attuned than ever to product reliability too. Computers and copying machines certainly compare on this basis.
Reliability may be closely related to performance. For instance, a product specification may define parameters for up-time, or acceptable failure rates. Reliability is a major contributor to brand or company image, and is considered a fundamental dimension of quality by most end-users. I.E., recent market research shows that, especially for women, reliability has become an automobile's most desired attribute.[2]
Conformance[edit]




The outcome of two example processes to show the meaning of the two approaches to conformance


The dimension of conformance depicts to what extent a product’s design and operating characteristics meet established standards. This dimension owes the most to the traditional approaches to quality pioneered by experts like Juran.[3]
All products and services involve specifications of some sort. When products are developed, these specifications are set and a target is set, for instance the materials used or the dimension of the product. Not only the target but also the tolerance (the range of permitted deviation from the target) is defined. One problem with this approach is that there is little interest in whether the specifications have been met exactly as long as the tolerance limits are met.
On the one hand, this can lead to the so-called “tolerance stack-up”. When two or more parts are to be fit together, the size of their tolerances often determine how well they will match. Should one part fall at a lower limit of its specification and a matching part at its upper limit, a tight fit is unlikely. The link is likely to wear more quickly than one made from parts whose dimensions have been centered more exactly.[2]
This problem can be addressed by taking a different approach to measuring quality. Instead of measuring a simple conformance to specifications, the degree to which parts or products diverge from the ideal target is measured. Using this approach, process 1 (see picture) is better even though some items fall beyond specification limits. The traditional approach would have favoured process 2 because it produces more items within the specification limit. It was demonstrated that the problem of “tolerance stack-up” is worse when the dimensions of parts are more distant from the target than when they cluster around it, even if some parts fall outside the tolerance. This approach requires a fresh look at the common process quality factor of 'defect rate', to take into account the fact that two parts may each pass the 'tolerance test' separately but be unusable when the attempt is made to join them together.
In service businesses, measures of conformance normally focus on accuracy and timeliness and include counts of processing errors, unanticipated delays and other frequent mistakes.[2]
Durability[edit]
Durability measures the length of a product’s life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly. Technically, durability can be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it deteriorates. After so many hours of use, the filament of a light bulb burns up and the bulb must be replaced. Repair is impossible. Economists call such products "one-hoss shays"[4] (Oliver Wendel Holmes poem).
In other cases, consumers must weigh the expected cost, in both dollars and personal inconvenience, of future repairs against the investment and operating expenses of a newer, more reliable model. Durability, then, may be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it breaks down and replacement is preferable to continued repair.
This approach to durability has two important implications. First, it suggests that durability and reliability are closely linked. A product that often fails is likely to be scrapped earlier than one that is more reliable; repair costs will be correspondingly higher and the purchase of a competitive brand will look that much more desirable. Second, this approach implies that durability figures should be interpreted with care. An increase in product life may not be the result of technical improvements or the use of longer-lived materials. Rather, the underlying economic environment simply may have changed.
Serviceability[edit]
Serviceability involves the consumer's ease of obtaining repair service (example: access to service centers and/or ease of self-service), the responsiveness of service personnel(example: ease of getting an appointment, willingness of repair personnel to listen to the customer), and the reliability of service (example: whether the service is performed right the first time). Competence and ease of repair is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the service personnel.
Consumers are concerned not only about a product breaking down but also about the time before service is restored, the timeliness with which service appointment are kept, the nature of dealings with service personnel, and the frequency with which service calls or repairs fail to correct outstanding problems. In those cases where problems are not immediately resolved and complaints are filed, a company's complaint handling procedures are also likely to affect customer's ultimate evaluation of product and service quality.
Some of these variables reflect differing personal standards of acceptable service. others can be measured quite objectively. Customers may remain dissatisfied even after completion of repairs. How these complaints are handled is important to a company's reputation for quality and service. Eventually, profitability is likely to be affected as well. Companies differ widely in their approaches to complaint handling and in the importance they attach to this element of serviceability. Some do their best to resolve complaints; others use legal gimmicks, the silent treatment and similar ploys to rebuff dissatisfied customers.
For example recently,[5] General Electric, Procter & Gamble and other companies have sought to preempt consumer dissatisfaction by installing toll-free telephone hot lines to their customer relations departments.
Important attributes for serviceability dimension are: service warranty, parts warranty, parts availability, number of reasonable distance to dealer service centers, distance to service parts center-dealer, distance to service parts center individual, length of wait for service appointment, schedule of preventive maintenance, employees listen to customers, information regarding repairs, courteous service centers, repaired correctly first time, service time relative to other dealers, warranty claims handled without argument, average repair cost/year, extended warranty, underestimation of service cost and provision of loan car.
Aesthetics or Style[edit]
The aesthetic properties of a product contribute to the identity of a company or a brand. Faults or defects in a product that diminish its aesthetic properties, even those that do not reduce or alter other dimensions of quality, are often cause for rejection.
Aesthetics refers to how the product looks, feels, sounds, tastes, or smells. It is clearly a matter of personal judgement and a reflection of individual preference. Nevertheless, there appear to be some patterns in consumers' rankings of products on the basis of taste.
A recent study of quality in 33 food categories, for example, found that high quality was most often associated with attributes such as "rich and full flavor, tastes natural, tastes fresh, good aroma, appetizing looks."[citation needed] Aesthetics also refers to the "outside" feel of the product.
The aesthetics dimension differs from subjective criteria pertaining to "performance" in that aesthetic choices are not nearly universal. Not all people prefer "rich and full" flavor or even agree on what that means. Companies therefore have to search for a niche. On this dimension of quality, it is impossible to please everyone.[2]
Quality in Japanese culture[edit]
In Japanese culture, there are two types of quality: atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu.[6]

atarimae hinshitsu　（当たり前品質） – The idea that things will work as they are supposed to (e.g. a pen will write). The functional requirement actually. For example, a wall or flooring in a house have functional parts in the house as a product; when the functionality is met, the "atarimae" quality requirement is met.
miryokuteki hinshitsu （魅力的品質）– The idea that things should have an aesthetic quality which is different from "atarimae hinshitsu" (e.g. a pen will write in a way that is pleasing to the writer, and leave behind ink that is pleasing to the reader). The floor and wall example can be expanded to include the color, texture, shine, polish, etc., which are the "miryokuteki" aspects. Such aspects comprise a very important part of the quality, and add value to the product.

In the design of goods or services, atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu together ensure that a creation will both work to customers' expectations and also be desirable to have.
Perceived Quality[edit]
Perception is not always reality.
Consumers do not always have complete information about a product's or service's attributes; indirect measures may be their only basis for comparing brands.
A product's durability for example, can seldom be observed directly; it usually must be inferred from various tangible and intangible aspects of the product. In such circumstances, images, advertising and brand names -inferences about quality rather than the reality itself- can be critical. For this reason, both Honda -which makes cars in Marysville, Ohio- and Sony -which builds color televisions in San Diego- have been reluctant to publicize that their products are "made in America".
Reputation is the primary stuff of perceived quality. Its power comes from an unstated analogy: that the quality of products today is similar to the quality of products of yesterday, or the quality of goods in a new product line is similar to the quality of a company's established products.[2]

Eight dimensions of quality

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Eight dimensions of product quality management can be used at a strategic level to analyze quality characteristics. The concept was defined by David A. Garvin. Some of the dimensions are mutually reinforcing, whereas others are not—improvement in one may be at the expense of others. Understanding the trade-offs desired by customers among these dimensions can help build a competitive advantage. Garvin's eight dimensions can be summarized as follows:[1]

Performance: Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes; brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance.
Features: Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user.
Reliability: Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail.
Conformance: Conformance is the precision with which the product or service meets the specified standards.
Durability: Durability measures the length of a product’s life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly.
Serviceability: Serviceability is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the serviceperson.
Aesthetics: Aesthetics is the subjective dimension indicating the kind of response a user has to a product. It represents the individual’s personal preference.
Perceived Quality: Perceived Quality is the quality attributed to a good or service based on indirect measures.

Performance[edit]
Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes, so brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance. Overall performance rankings, however, are more difficult to develop, especially when they involve benefits that not every consumer needs. Performance is often a source of contention between customers and suppliers, particularly when deliverables are not adequately defined within specifications. The performance of a product often influences the profitability or reputation of the end-user. As such, many contracts or specifications include damages related to inadequate performance. The question of whether performance differences are quality differences may depend on circumstantial preferences-but preferences based on functional requirements, not taste. Some performance standards are based on subjective preferences, but the preferences are so universal that they have the force of an objective standard.[2]
Features[edit]
Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user.
Similar thinking can be applied to features, a second dimensions of quality that is often a secondary aspects of performance. Features are the "bells and whistles" of products and services, those characteristics that supplement their basic functioning. Examples include free drinks on a plane, permanent-press cycles on a washing machine, and automatic tuners on a color television set. The line separating primary performance characteristics from secondary features is often difficult to draw.[2]
Reliability[edit]
Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail.
This dimension reflects the probability of a product malfunctioning or failing within a specified time period. Among the most common measures of reliability are the mean time to first failure, the mean time between failures, and the failure rate per unit time. Because these measures require a product to be in use for a specified period, they are more relevant to durable goods than to products and services that are consumed instantly.
Reliability normally becomes more important to consumers as downtime and maintenance become more expensive. Farmers, for example, are especially sensitive to downtime during the short harvest season. Reliable equipment can mean the difference between a good year and spoiled crops. But consumers on other markets are more attuned than ever to product reliability too. Computers and copying machines certainly compare on this basis.
Reliability may be closely related to performance. For instance, a product specification may define parameters for up-time, or acceptable failure rates. Reliability is a major contributor to brand or company image, and is considered a fundamental dimension of quality by most end-users. I.E., recent market research shows that, especially for women, reliability has become an automobile's most desired attribute.[2]
Conformance[edit]




The outcome of two example processes to show the meaning of the two approaches to conformance


The dimension of conformance depicts to what extent a product’s design and operating characteristics meet established standards. This dimension owes the most to the traditional approaches to quality pioneered by experts like Juran.[3]
All products and services involve specifications of some sort. When products are developed, these specifications are set and a target is set, for instance the materials used or the dimension of the product. Not only the target but also the tolerance (the range of permitted deviation from the target) is defined. One problem with this approach is that there is little interest in whether the specifications have been met exactly as long as the tolerance limits are met.
On the one hand, this can lead to the so-called “tolerance stack-up”. When two or more parts are to be fit together, the size of their tolerances often determine how well they will match. Should one part fall at a lower limit of its specification and a matching part at its upper limit, a tight fit is unlikely. The link is likely to wear more quickly than one made from parts whose dimensions have been centered more exactly.[2]
This problem can be addressed by taking a different approach to measuring quality. Instead of measuring a simple conformance to specifications, the degree to which parts or products diverge from the ideal target is measured. Using this approach, process 1 (see picture) is better even though some items fall beyond specification limits. The traditional approach would have favoured process 2 because it produces more items within the specification limit. It was demonstrated that the problem of “tolerance stack-up” is worse when the dimensions of parts are more distant from the target than when they cluster around it, even if some parts fall outside the tolerance. This approach requires a fresh look at the common process quality factor of 'defect rate', to take into account the fact that two parts may each pass the 'tolerance test' separately but be unusable when the attempt is made to join them together.
In service businesses, measures of conformance normally focus on accuracy and timeliness and include counts of processing errors, unanticipated delays and other frequent mistakes.[2]
Durability[edit]
Durability measures the length of a product’s life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly. Technically, durability can be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it deteriorates. After so many hours of use, the filament of a light bulb burns up and the bulb must be replaced. Repair is impossible. Economists call such products "one-hoss shays"[4] (Oliver Wendel Holmes poem).
In other cases, consumers must weigh the expected cost, in both dollars and personal inconvenience, of future repairs against the investment and operating expenses of a newer, more reliable model. Durability, then, may be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it breaks down and replacement is preferable to continued repair.
This approach to durability has two important implications. First, it suggests that durability and reliability are closely linked. A product that often fails is likely to be scrapped earlier than one that is more reliable; repair costs will be correspondingly higher and the purchase of a competitive brand will look that much more desirable. Second, this approach implies that durability figures should be interpreted with care. An increase in product life may not be the result of technical improvements or the use of longer-lived materials. Rather, the underlying economic environment simply may have changed.
Serviceability[edit]
Serviceability involves the consumer's ease of obtaining repair service (example: access to service centers and/or ease of self-service), the responsiveness of service personnel(example: ease of getting an appointment, willingness of repair personnel to listen to the customer), and the reliability of service (example: whether the service is performed right the first time). Competence and ease of repair is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the service personnel.
Consumers are concerned not only about a product breaking down but also about the time before service is restored, the timeliness with which service appointment are kept, the nature of dealings with service personnel, and the frequency with which service calls or repairs fail to correct outstanding problems. In those cases where problems are not immediately resolved and complaints are filed, a company's complaint handling procedures are also likely to affect customer's ultimate evaluation of product and service quality.

Not all people prefer "rich and full" flavor or even agree on what that means. Companies therefore have to search for a niche. On this dimension of quality, it is impossible to please everyone.[2]
Quality in Japanese culture[edit]
In Japanese culture, there are two types of quality: atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu.[6]

atarimae hinshitsu　（当たり前品質） – The idea that things will work as they are supposed to (e.g. a pen will write). The functional requirement actually. For example, a wall or flooring in a house have functional parts in the house as a product; when the functionality is met, the "atarimae" quality requirement is met.
miryokuteki hinshitsu （魅力的品質）– The idea that things should have an aesthetic quality which is different from "atarimae hinshitsu" (e.g. a pen will write in a way that is pleasing to the writer, and leave behind ink that is pleasing to the reader). The floor and wall example can be expanded to include the color, texture, shine, polish, etc., which are the "miryokuteki" aspects. Such aspects comprise a very important part of the quality, and add value to the product.

In the design of goods or services, atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu together ensure that a creation will both work to customers' expectations and also be desirable to have.
Perceived Quality[edit]
Perception is not always reality.
Consumers do not always have complete information about a product's or service's attributes; indirect measures may be their only basis for comparing brands.
A product's durability for example, can seldom be observed directly; it usually must be inferred from various tangible and intangible aspects of the product. In such circumstances, images, advertising and brand names -inferences about quality rather than the reality itself- can be critical. For this reason, both Honda -which makes cars in Marysville, Ohio- and Sony -which builds color televisions in San Diego- have been reluctant to publicize that their products are "made in America".
Reputation is the primary stuff of perceived quality. Its power comes from an unstated analogy: that the quality of products today is similar to the quality of products of yesterday, or the quality of goods in a new product line is similar to the quality of a company's established products.[2]

Eight dimensions of quality

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Eight dimensions of product quality management can be used at a strategic level to analyze quality characteristics. The concept was defined by David A. Garvin. Some of the dimensions are mutually reinforcing, whereas others are not—improvement in one may be at the expense of others. Understanding the trade-offs desired by customers among these dimensions can help build a competitive advantage. Garvin's eight dimensions can be summarized as follows:[1]

Performance: Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes; brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance.
Features: Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user.
Reliability: Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail.
Conformance: Conformance is the precision with which the product or service meets the specified standards.
Durability: Durability measures the length of a product’s life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly.
Serviceability: Serviceability is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the serviceperson.
Aesthetics: Aesthetics is the subjective dimension indicating the kind of response a user has to a product. It represents the individual’s personal preference.
Perceived Quality: Perceived Quality is the quality attributed to a good or service based on indirect measures.

Performance[edit]
Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes, so brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance. Overall performance rankings, however, are more difficult to develop, especially when they involve benefits that not every consumer needs. Performance is often a source of contention between customers and suppliers, particularly when deliverables are not adequately defined within specifications. The performance of a product often influences the profitability or reputation of the end-user. As such, many contracts or specifications include damages related to inadequate performance. The question of whether performance differences are quality differences may depend on circumstantial preferences-but preferences based on functional requirements, not taste. Some performance standards are based on subjective preferences, but the preferences are so universal that they have the force of an objective standard.[2]
Features[edit]
Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user.
Similar thinking can be applied to features, a second dimensions of quality that is often a secondary aspects of performance. Features are the "bells and whistles" of products and services, those characteristics that supplement their basic functioning. Examples include free drinks on a plane, permanent-press cycles on a washing machine, and automatic tuners on a color television set. The line separating primary performance characteristics from secondary features is often difficult to draw.[2]
Reliability[edit]
Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail.
This dimension reflects the probability of a product malfunctioning or failing within a specified time period. Among the most common measures of reliability are the mean time to first failure, the mean time between failures, and the failure rate per unit time. Because these measures require a product to be in use for a specified period, they are more relevant to durable goods than to products and services that are consumed instantly.
Reliability normally becomes more important to consumers as downtime and maintenance become more expensive. Farmers, for example, are especially sensitive to downtime during the short harvest season. Reliable equipment can mean the difference between a good year and spoiled crops. But consumers on other markets are more attuned than ever to product reliability too. Computers and copying machines certainly compare on this basis.
Reliability may be closely related to performance. For instance, a product specification may define parameters for up-time, or acceptable failure rates. Reliability is a major contributor to brand or company image, and is considered a fundamental dimension of quality by most end-users. I.E., recent market research shows that, especially for women, reliability has become an automobile's most desired attribute.[2]
Conformance[edit]




The outcome of two example processes to show the meaning of the two approaches to conformance


The dimension of conformance depicts to what extent a product’s design and operating characteristics meet established standards. This dimension owes the most to the traditional approaches to quality pioneered by experts like Juran.[3]
All products and services involve specifications of some sort. When products are developed, these specifications are set and a target is set, for instance the materials used or the dimension of the product. Not only the target but also the tolerance (the range of permitted deviation from the target) is defined. One problem with this approach is that there is little interest in whether the specifications have been met exactly as long as the tolerance limits are met.
On the one hand, this can lead to the so-called “tolerance stack-up”. When two or more parts are to be fit together, the size of their tolerances often determine how well they will match. Should one part fall at a lower limit of its specification and a matching part at its upper limit, a tight fit is unlikely. The link is likely to wear more quickly than one made from parts whose dimensions have been centered more exactly.[2]
This problem can be addressed by taking a different approach to measuring quality. Instead of measuring a simple conformance to specifications, the degree to which parts or products diverge from the ideal target is measured. Using this approach, process 1 (see picture) is better even though some items fall beyond specification limits. The traditional approach would have favoured process 2 because it produces more items within the specification limit. It was demonstrated that the problem of “tolerance stack-up” is worse when the dimensions of parts are more distant from the target than when they cluster around it, even if some parts fall outside the tolerance. This approach requires a fresh look at the common process quality factor of 'defect rate', to take into account the fact that two parts may each pass the 'tolerance test' separately but be unusable when the attempt is made to join them together.
In service businesses, measures of conformance normally focus on accuracy and timeliness and include counts of processing errors, unanticipated delays and other frequent mistakes.[2]
Durability[edit]
Durability measures the length of a product’s life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly. Technically, durability can be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it deteriorates. After so many hours of use, the filament of a light bulb burns up and the bulb must be replaced. Repair is impossible. Economists call such products "one-hoss shays"[4] (Oliver Wendel Holmes poem).
In other cases, consumers must weigh the expected cost, in both dollars and personal inconvenience, of future repairs against the investment and operating expenses of a newer, more reliable model. Durability, then, may be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it breaks down and replacement is preferable to continued repair.
This approach to durability has two important implications. First, it suggests that durability and reliability are closely linked. A product that often fails is likely to be scrapped earlier than one that is more reliable; repair costs will be correspondingly higher and the purchase of a competitive brand will look that much more desirable. Second, this approach implies that durability figures should be interpreted with care. An increase in product life may not be the result of technical improvements or the use of longer-lived materials. Rather, the underlying economic environment simply may have changed.
Serviceability[edit]
Serviceability involves the consumer's ease of obtaining repair service (example: access to service centers and/or ease of self-service), the responsiveness of service personnel(example: ease of getting an appointment, willingness of repair personnel to listen to the customer), and the reliability of service (example: whether the service is performed right the first time). Competence and ease of repair is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the service personnel.
Consumers are concerned not only about a product breaking down but also about the time before service is restored, the timeliness with which service appointment are kept, the nature of dealings with service personnel, and the frequency with which service calls or repairs fail to correct outstanding problems. In those cases where problems are not immediately resolved and complaints are filed, a company's complaint handling procedures are also likely to affect customer's ultimate evaluation of product and service quality.
Some of these variables reflect differing personal standards of acceptable service. others can be measured quite objectively. Customers may remain dissatisfied even after completion of repairs. How these complaints are handled is important to a company's reputation for quality and service. Eventually, profitability is likely to be affected as well. Companies differ widely in their approaches to complaint handling and in the importance they attach to this element of serviceability. Some do their best to resolve complaints; others use legal gimmicks, the silent treatment and similar ploys to rebuff dissatisfied customers.
For example recently,[5] General Electric, Procter & Gamble and other companies have sought to preempt consumer dissatisfaction by installing toll-free telephone hot lines to their customer relations departments.
Important attributes for serviceability dimension are: service warranty, parts warranty, parts availability, number of reasonable distance to dealer service centers, distance to service parts center-dealer, distance to service parts center individual, length of wait for service appointment, schedule of preventive maintenance, employees listen to customers, information regarding repairs, courteous service centers, repaired correctly first time, service time relative to other dealers, warranty claims handled without argument, average repair cost/year, extended warranty, underestimation of service cost and provision of loan car.
Aesthetics or Style[edit]
The aesthetic properties of a product contribute to the identity of a company or a brand. Faults or defects in a product that diminish its aesthetic properties, even those that do not reduce or alter other dimensions of quality, are often cause for rejection.
Aesthetics refers to how the product looks, feels, sounds, tastes, or smells. It is clearly a matter of personal judgement and a reflection of individual preference. Nevertheless, there appear to be some patterns in consumers' rankings of products on the basis of taste.
A recent study of quality in 33 food categories, for example, found that high quality was most often associated with attributes such as "rich and full flavor, tastes natural, tastes fresh, good aroma, appetizing looks."[citation needed] Aesthetics also refers to the "outside" feel of the product.
The aesthetics dimension differs from subjective criteria pertaining to "performance" in that aesthetic choices are not nearly universal. Not all people prefer "rich and full" flavor or even agree on what that means. Companies therefore have to search for a niche. On this dimension of quality, it is impossible to please everyone.[2]
Quality in Japanese culture[edit]
In Japanese culture, there are two types of quality: atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu.[6]

atarimae hinshitsu　（当たり前品質） – The idea that things will work as they are supposed to (e.g. a pen will write). The functional requirement actually. For example, a wall or flooring in a house have functional parts in the house as a product; when the functionality is met, the "atarimae" quality requirement is met.
miryokuteki hinshitsu （魅力的品質）– The idea that things should have an aesthetic quality which is different from "atarimae hinshitsu" (e.g. a pen will write in a way that is pleasing to the writer, and leave behind ink that is pleasing to the reader). The floor and wall example can be expanded to include the color, texture, shine, polish, etc., which are the "miryokuteki" aspects. Such aspects comprise a very important part of the quality, and add value to the product.

In the design of goods or services, atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu together ensure that a creation will both work to customers' expectations and also be desirable to have.

Eight dimensions of quality

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Eight dimensions of product quality management can be used at a strategic level to analyze quality characteristics. The concept was defined by David A. Garvin. Some of the dimensions are mutually reinforcing, whereas others are not—improvement in one may be at the expense of others. Understanding the trade-offs desired by customers among these dimensions can help build a competitive advantage. Garvin's eight dimensions can be summarized as follows:[1]

Performance: Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes; brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance.
Features: Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user.
Reliability: Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail.
Conformance: Conformance is the precision with which the product or service meets the specified standards.
Durability: Durability measures the length of a product’s life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly.
Serviceability: Serviceability is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the serviceperson.
Aesthetics: Aesthetics is the subjective dimension indicating the kind of response a user has to a product. It represents the individual’s personal preference.
Perceived Quality: Perceived Quality is the quality attributed to a good or service based on indirect measures.

Performance[edit]
Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes, so brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance. Overall performance rankings, however, are more difficult to develop, especially when they involve benefits that not every consumer needs. Performance is often a source of contention between customers and suppliers, particularly when deliverables are not adequately defined within specifications. The performance of a product often influences the profitability or reputation of the end-user. As such, many contracts or specifications include damages related to inadequate performance. The question of whether performance differences are quality differences may depend on circumstantial preferences-but preferences based on functional requirements, not taste. Some performance standards are based on subjective preferences, but the preferences are so universal that they have the force of an objective standard.[2]
Features[edit]
Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user.
Similar thinking can be applied to features, a second dimensions of quality that is often a secondary aspects of performance. Features are the "bells and whistles" of products and services, those characteristics that supplement their basic functioning. Examples include free drinks on a plane, permanent-press cycles on a washing machine, and automatic tuners on a color television set. The line separating primary performance characteristics from secondary features is often difficult to draw.[2]
Reliability[edit]
Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail.
This dimension reflects the probability of a product malfunctioning or failing within a specified time period. Among the most common measures of reliability are the mean time to first failure, the mean time between failures, and the failure rate per unit time. Because these measures require a product to be in use for a specified period, they are more relevant to durable goods than to products and services that are consumed instantly.
Reliability normally becomes more important to consumers as downtime and maintenance become more expensive. Farmers, for example, are especially sensitive to downtime during the short harvest season. Reliable equipment can mean the difference between a good year and spoiled crops. But consumers on other markets are more attuned than ever to product reliability too. Computers and copying machines certainly compare on this basis.
Reliability may be closely related to performance. For instance, a product specification may define parameters for up-time, or acceptable failure rates. Reliability is a major contributor to brand or company image, and is considered a fundamental dimension of quality by most end-users. I.E., recent market research shows that, especially for women, reliability has become an automobile's most desired attribute.[2]
Conformance[edit]




The outcome of two example processes to show the meaning of the two approaches to conformance


The dimension of conformance depicts to what extent a product’s design and operating characteristics meet established standards. This dimension owes the most to the traditional approaches to quality pioneered by experts like Juran.[3]
All products and services involve specifications of some sort. When products are developed, these specifications are set and a target is set, for instance the materials used or the dimension of the product. Not only the target but also the tolerance (the range of permitted deviation from the target) is defined. One problem with this approach is that there is little interest in whether the specifications have been met exactly as long as the tolerance limits are met.
On the one hand, this can lead to the so-called “tolerance stack-up”. When two or more parts are to be fit together, the size of their tolerances often determine how well they will match. Should one part fall at a lower limit of its specification and a matching part at its upper limit, a tight fit is unlikely. The link is likely to wear more quickly than one made from parts whose dimensions have been centered more exactly.[2]
This problem can be addressed by taking a different approach to measuring quality. Instead of measuring a simple conformance to specifications, the degree to which parts or products diverge from the ideal target is measured. Using this approach, process 1 (see picture) is better even though some items fall beyond specification limits. The traditional approach would have favoured process 2 because it produces more items within the specification limit. It was demonstrated that the problem of “tolerance stack-up” is worse when the dimensions of parts are more distant from the target than when they cluster around it, even if some parts fall outside the tolerance. This approach requires a fresh look at the common process quality factor of 'defect rate', to take into account the fact that two parts may each pass the 'tolerance test' separately but be unusable when the attempt is made to join them together.
In service businesses, measures of conformance normally focus on accuracy and timeliness and include counts of processing errors, unanticipated delays and other frequent mistakes.[2]
Durability[edit]
Durability measures the length of a product’s life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly. Technically, durability can be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it deteriorates. After so many hours of use, the filament of a light bulb burns up and the bulb must be replaced. Repair is impossible. Economists call such products "one-hoss shays"[4] (Oliver Wendel Holmes poem).
In other cases, consumers must weigh the expected cost, in both dollars and personal inconvenience, of future repairs against the investment and operating expenses of a newer, more reliable model. Durability, then, may be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it breaks down and replacement is preferable to continued repair.
This approach to durability has two important implications. First, it suggests that durability and reliability are closely linked. A product that often fails is likely to be scrapped earlier than one that is more reliable; repair costs will be correspondingly higher and the purchase of a competitive brand will look that much more desirable. Second, this approach implies that durability figures should be interpreted with care. An increase in product life may not be the result of technical improvements or the use of longer-lived materials. Rather, the underlying economic environment simply may have changed.
Serviceability[edit]
Serviceability involves the consumer's ease of obtaining repair service (example: access to service centers and/or ease of self-service), the responsiveness of service personnel(example: ease of getting an appointment, willingness of repair personnel to listen to the customer), and the reliability of service (example: whether the service is performed right the first time). Competence and ease of repair is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the service personnel.
Consumers are concerned not only about a product breaking down but also about the time before service is restored, the timeliness with which service appointment are kept, the nature of dealings with service personnel, and the frequency with which service calls or repairs fail to correct outstanding problems. In those cases where problems are not immediately resolved and complaints are filed, a company's complaint handling procedures are also likely to affect customer's ultimate evaluation of product and service quality.
Some of these variables reflect differing personal standards of acceptable service. others can be measured quite objectively. Customers may remain dissatisfied even after completion of repairs. How these complaints are handled is important to a company's reputation for quality and service. Eventually, profitability is likely to be affected as well. Companies differ widely in their approaches to complaint handling and in the importance they attach to this element of serviceability. Some do their best to resolve complaints; others use legal gimmicks, the silent treatment and similar ploys to rebuff dissatisfied customers.
For example recently,[5] General Electric, Procter & Gamble and other companies have sought to preempt consumer dissatisfaction by installing toll-free telephone hot lines to their customer relations departments.
Important attributes for serviceability dimension are: service warranty, parts warranty, parts availability, number of reasonable distance to dealer service centers, distance to service parts center-dealer, distance to service parts center individual, length of wait for service appointment, schedule of preventive maintenance, employees listen to customers, information regarding repairs, courteous service centers, repaired correctly first time, service time relative to other dealers, warranty claims handled without argument, average repair cost/year, extended warranty, underestimation of service cost and provision of loan car.
Aesthetics or Style[edit]
The aesthetic properties of a product contribute to the identity of a company or a brand. Faults or defects in a product that diminish its aesthetic properties, even those that do not reduce or alter other dimensions of quality, are often cause for rejection.
Aesthetics refers to how the product looks, feels, sounds, tastes, or smells. It is clearly a matter of personal judgement and a reflection of individual preference. Nevertheless, there appear to be some patterns in consumers' rankings of products on the basis of taste.
A recent study of quality in 33 food categories, for example, found that high quality was most often associated with attributes such as "rich and full flavor, tastes natural, tastes fresh, good aroma, appetizing looks."[citation needed] Aesthetics also refers to the "outside" feel of the product.
The aesthetics dimension differs from subjective criteria pertaining to "performance" in that aesthetic choices are not nearly universal. Not all people prefer "rich and full" flavor or even agree on what that means. Companies therefore have to search for a niche. On this dimension of quality, it is impossible to please everyone.[2]
Quality in Japanese culture[edit]
In Japanese culture, there are two types of quality: atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu.[6]

atarimae hinshitsu　（当たり前品質） – The idea that things will work as they are supposed to (e.g. a pen will write). The functional requirement actually. For example, a wall or flooring in a house have functional parts in the house as a product; when the functionality is met, the "atarimae" quality requirement is met.
miryokuteki hinshitsu （魅力的品質）– The idea that things should have an aesthetic quality which is different from "atarimae hinshitsu" (e.g. a pen will write in a way that is pleasing to the writer, and leave behind ink that is pleasing to the reader). The floor and wall example can be expanded to include the color, texture, shine, polish, etc., which are the "miryokuteki" aspects. Such aspects comprise a very important part of the quality, and add value to the product.

In the design of goods or services, atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu together ensure that a creation will both work to customers' expectations and also be desirable to have.
Perceived Quality[edit]
Perception is not always reality.
Consumers do not always have complete information about a product's or service's attributes; indirect measures may be their only basis for comparing brands.
A product's durability for example, can seldom be observed directly; it usually must be inferred from various tangible and intangible aspects of the product. In such circumstances, images, advertising and brand names -inferences about quality rather than the reality itself- can be critical. For this reason, both Honda -which makes cars in Marysville, Ohio- and Sony -which builds color televisions in San Diego- have been reluctant to publicize that their products are "made in America".
Reputation is the primary stuff of perceived quality. Its power comes from an unstated analogy: that the quality of products today is similar to the quality of products of yesterday, or the quality of goods in a new product line is similar to the quality of a company's established products.[2]

4.0 out of 5 starsDarling Buds = Winning BudsByPeter H Spenceron November 24, 2014This is an excellent series, but I gave it four stars only because there is a problem on American DVD players with the default resolution. Out of the box, the picture on the screen is too wide. I had to reset the HDMI resolution to 480i, and that solved the problem. If you're not using the HDMI port on the TV, I assume that the resolution for other ports can be reset also.The show is very amusing, particularly if you enjoy a family of good natured rogues who live in the bucolic English countryside. I strongly recommend this series to anyone who likes good acting, convincing characters, and British TV production standards.

    See all 44 reviews4.0 out of 5 starsDarling Buds = Winning BudsByPeter H Spenceron November 24, 2014Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseThis is an excellent series, but I gave it four stars only because there is a problem on American DVD players with the default resolution. Out of the box, the picture on the screen is too wide. I had to reset the HDMI resolution to 480i, and that solved the problem. If you're not using the HDMI port on the TV, I assume that the resolution for other ports can be reset also.The show is very amusing, particularly if you enjoy a family of good natured rogues who live in the bucolic English countryside. I strongly recommend this series to anyone who likes good acting, convincing characters, and British TV production standards.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsTop Notch "Feel Good" TVByJust a guyon June 21, 2015Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseEverything - the stories, camerawork, music, and especially the performances - is in sync.  You'll feel better after spending an hour and a half at the Larkin's Kent farm in the late 1950s.For those who first experienced Pam Ferris in Call the Midwife, this role is nearly 180 degrees opposite.  Here she's "Ma," an unmarried farmwife raising (and cooking!) a small brood while taking care of her "Pa" - David Jason.  Catherine Zeta Jones plays their eldest daughter, and with Philip Franks are the younger couple whom Ma & Pa keep under their wing through minor misadventures.As Pa would say, "Perfick!"0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

You can get a region 2 player and this set for less than the cost of the region 1 set.Byradon April 23, 2015Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseA delightful Brit sitcom.  The Larkins are a seemingly happy and robust family with nothing to hide.  But they always seem to have whatever they need, or want.  A young, insecure taxman enters their life and they decide to keep him as the family's eldest daughter has decided she wants him.  He is stricken by her beauty but is too shy to do anything and lets himself get lured into spending the night.  And into taking several days off work and sticking around...Little by little he thinks less and less about getting the tax info he was sent to get. This is the beginning of a delightful, short series set mostly in rural England in the 1950's.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

It is filled with real love, family relationships and characters that make you smile.  H.E. Bates was a wonderful writer and I know he would smile if he could see his work translated to the screen.  Ma and Pa are so adorable that when each episode ends, you will have a HUGE smile on your face.  That is what entertainment's supposed to be.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Is Russia's Government Hostile...


Murder: A Socratic Dialogue...

I was on an email discussion this morning with some free-market economists and some economically literate fans of free markets. One of them surprised me with this statement:
I always tell my students the Henry Ford $5 a day story in 1914, a great example of management looking out for labor and a "win win" formula for success.  It stopped Marxism's two big arguments:  that capitalists exploit workers and that capitalism alienates workers, forcing them to produce products they can't afford themselves.  But when Ford overnight raised workers pay to $5 a day, it was the first big example of sharing the profits -- and Ford workers could buy Model T's for the first time, thus destroying the Marxist argument of alienation. 
There's nothing necessarily incorrect in his actual statement above. But there is something misleading. It may well be the case that Ford workers could buy Model Ts for the first time because of the increased wages, but he makes it sound as if that was Henry Ford's motive. That's unlikely to have been Ford's motive because the number of Ford workers was probably well under 1% of the number of potential buyers. Would it really make sense to pay more than necessary to get workers so that your number of potential buyers can increase slightly, especially when the downside is that with the higher wages come higher costs and your larger potential market is likely to shrink?

I think it was a fortunate accident that Ford's workers were able to buy Fords. The reason I've read for Ford's success is that Ford was plagued with high turnover and high absenteeism and paying above market reduced turnover and absenteeism substantially. One can imagine this being particularly important in a relatively new industry and certainly an industry with a relatively new production method--the assembly line--because there was probably a bigger gain than normal from keeping people on the job who gradually got very good at it.
If you still think the "pay them more so they can buy the product" argument makes sense, then consider what Henry Hazlitt wrote on this issue in his 1946 classic, Economics in One Lesson:
Some sponsors of the theory seem to imply that the workers in each industry should receive enough to buy back the particular product they make. But they surely cannot mean that the makers of cheap dresses should get enough to buy back cheap dresses and the makers of mink coats enough to buy back mink coats; or that the men in the Ford plant should receive enough to buy Fords and the men in the Cadillac plant enough to buy Cadillacs. 
So a question for the person I quoted above, based on Hazlitt's quote, is this: Were Cadillac workers more alienated than Ford workers?

A few years ago, I used Hazlitt as a supplement to my main text and we covered this chapter. Remember that my students are largely military officers and disproportionately Naval officers. One U.S. Navy student had a great example to make Hazlitt's point. He pointed out it's not a good idea to pay workers making aircraft carriers high enough wages that each of them could buy an aircraft carrier.
Here's an earlier discussion of the issue.

Also, the "buy back the product" argument is literally incoherent. Wages enough to buy the product OVER WHAT TIME PERIOD? Should a person who makes a car be paid enough to buy a new car every year? Every day? Every century?
In fact, everyone is paid enough to buy the product, if you just assume a sufficiently long time horizon. Every worker who contributes to building an aircraft carrier IS paid enough to buy an aircraft carrier, if he just works long enough. (Which may be a thousand years, but who's counting? Not the socialists. They literally don't consider this issue, as far as I know.)

@Michael Makovi,
I think you're not considering consumer behavior. Consumers have their own preferences and these change with income.  A person earning half your wage isn't going to match your consumption habits (just at half the speed) even if they were your clone.
Intuitively, someone living paycheck-to-paycheck may not be willing to wipe out their savings in exchange for a machine that adds costs to their lives and has a declining resale value.
In terms used in economics:
a) People earning low wages usually have higher discount rates than people earning high wages and so purchases of expensive durable goods will seem more attractive to people as their wages rise.
b) Going back to first year economics a consumer's indifference curve for automobiles may intersect with their budget constraint at q=0, and this is less likely the more income someone has.

The Ford example is one that drives me crazy. As Dr. Henderson noted the wage increase was to retain experienced workers. This helped keep the prices low enough that the workers who didn't work for Ford were able to buy the product.

fralupo,
I think adding consumer preferences just makes socialism even worse. 
For example, some socialists will advocate worker control of the firm. The problem is, many workers don't want to control the firm. They'd prefer to make certain, guaranteed wages rather than uncertain, varying profits (and losses). Whether the firm makes a profit or a loss this firm, they'd rather just receive their salary.
And as many professors can attest, having to serve on a governing committee can be awfully bothersome. Many workers would probably prefer to avoid the burden of having to help run the company.
So I think there's a general problem with socialism, viz. that many consumers don't want what socialists think they ought to want.

I would argue that low wage people should do as you say. An unfortunate number of them live paycheck to paycheck due to poor choices. Rent to own big screen TV instead of cash for a smaller or used unit for example. In my case, I bought a Silverado back when making $5.40 an hour, stupid and still embarrassing if I think about it. .

We should keep in mind that the Ford assembly line was VERY different from traditional hand-crafted "carriage" manufacture.  He needed workers who were very on-the-ball, because a small screw-up could "stop the line".  And it is likely that assembly line work, though more efficient, was probably very boring to do one small task hundreds of times per day compared with doing a wider range of handcrafting at a more relaxed pace.
Ford also had a kind of "secret service" who investigated the "moral character" of his employees.  He paid a lot, but he expected a lot as well.
I believe Ford did sell is $5 day as some kind of benificence to his employees, but it was only the improved productivity of the assembly line that could allow it, and the stringent requirements of the assembly line also demanded it to bring in the best workers.

My favorite argument against the "pay them more so they can buy the product" version is: even in the best-case scenario where every penny of the wage increase goes towards a Model T, all Ford has done is find an indirect method of giving away cars.

Tim Worstall had a bit of fun with this a few years back:
"Car production in the year before the pay rise was 170,000, in the year of it 202,000. As we can see above the total labour establishment was only 14,000 anyway. Even if all of his workers bought a car every year it wasn't going to make any but a marginal difference to the sales of the firm.
"We can go further too. As we've seen the rise in the daily wage was from $2.25 to $5 (including the bonuses etc). Say 240 working days in the year and 14,000 workers and we get a rise in the pay bill of  $9 1/4 million over the year. A Model T cost between $550 and $450 (depends on which year we're talking about). 14,000 cars sold at that price gives us $7 3/4 million to $6 1/4 million in income to the company.
"It should be obvious that paying the workforce an extra $9 million so that they can then buy $7 million's worth of company production just isn't a way to increase your profits. It's a great way to increase your losses though."

If the goal is to pay workers enough to buy back the product, and many minimum wage workers work in fast food (or other food service jobs), where the products are often $1 or just a little more, wouldn't that necessarily imply reducing the minimum wage?

Uneducated as he was, Henry Ford understood production. With a turnover rate approaching 300% in his work force the slowdown on the assembly line as they trained new workers was very costly. Hence the $5 wage. It ended turnover and production increased accordingly and profits increased.

Might it have had a psychological impact?
Cars, unlike airliners, were a new product that Ford workers could surely see a use for in their own lives. Getting paid enough to actually being able to afford to buy one might improve workers' job satisfaction.

The funny thing is, $15 minimum wage proponents suddenly remember the actual reason why Ford raised wages when talking about low wage jobs. (And assume it was the wage, not the worker the wage was attracting that led to the improvements.) It's one of those great stories: It can mean anything you want it to depending on how you tell it.

@Hasdrubal
Agreed, although there is an aspect of the argument minimum wage proponents who try to tout the minimum wage as an efficiency wage miss: the efficiency wage increases productivity by increasing unemployment.  
An efficiency wage is not much more than a self-imposed price floor, whose job is to limit workers shirking on the job.  The idea is, if a firm pays above-market wages, then a worker will work harder for fear of losing his job and being forced to take less pay somewhere else.  If all firms pay this efficiency wage, a worker will work harder because there is now unemployment in the labor market; there are others who are willing and able to take his job.  
So, when minimum wage proponents make the efficiency wage argument, they are implicitly allowing (indeed, calling for) unemployment to increase.

Nothing like hijacking one of David’s posts for a short rant…..
The “pay them enough to buy what they make” is an obviously silly argument. But our econ 101 answer, “pay them their marginal revenue product”, isn't helpful--it  doesn't do much to explain Ford's wages and leaves students vulnerable to bogus stories like this.
 As an opening sentence in a long novel on labor markets “w=MRP” is only slightly better than “It was a dark and stormy night.” Maybe it’s true, maybe it’s not. But it’s boring and misses all the color, passion and drama that are part of the story of real labor markets. Things like efficiency wages, various types of human capital, signaling and the non pecuniary aspects of work matter much more than the first derivative of a profit function with labor as an independent variable. 
There’s nothing wrong with teaching simple optimization. These are useful life skills that every freshman or MBA student should have. But when teaching labor don’t leave out the sex and violence parts of the novel just because it’s hard to think up good multiple choice questions. 
…rant concluded. (BTW not accusing David of ignoring this stuff in his teaching and writing.)

I was on an email discussion this morning with some free-market economists and some economically literate fans of free markets. One of them surprised me with this statement:
I always tell my students the Henry Ford $5 a day story in 1914, a great example of management looking out for labor and a "win win" formula for success.  It stopped Marxism's two big arguments:  that capitalists exploit workers and that capitalism alienates workers, forcing them to produce products they can't afford themselves.  But when Ford overnight raised workers pay to $5 a day, it was the first big example of sharing the profits -- and Ford workers could buy Model T's for the first time, thus destroying the Marxist argument of alienation. 
There's nothing necessarily incorrect in his actual statement above. But there is something misleading. It may well be the case that Ford workers could buy Model Ts for the first time because of the increased wages, but he makes it sound as if that was Henry Ford's motive. That's unlikely to have been Ford's motive because the number of Ford workers was probably well under 1% of the number of potential buyers. Would it really make sense to pay more than necessary to get workers so that your number of potential buyers can increase slightly, especially when the downside is that with the higher wages come higher costs and your larger potential market is likely to shrink?

I think it was a fortunate accident that Ford's workers were able to buy Fords. The reason I've read for Ford's success is that Ford was plagued with high turnover and high absenteeism and paying above market reduced turnover and absenteeism substantially. One can imagine this being particularly important in a relatively new industry and certainly an industry with a relatively new production method--the assembly line--because there was probably a bigger gain than normal from keeping people on the job who gradually got very good at it.
If you still think the "pay them more so they can buy the product" argument makes sense, then consider what Henry Hazlitt wrote on this issue in his 1946 classic, Economics in One Lesson:
Some sponsors of the theory seem to imply that the workers in each industry should receive enough to buy back the particular product they make. But they surely cannot mean that the makers of cheap dresses should get enough to buy back cheap dresses and the makers of mink coats enough to buy back mink coats; or that the men in the Ford plant should receive enough to buy Fords and the men in the Cadillac plant enough to buy Cadillacs. 
So a question for the person I quoted above, based on Hazlitt's quote, is this: Were Cadillac workers more alienated than Ford workers?

A few years ago, I used Hazlitt as a supplement to my main text and we covered this chapter. Remember that my students are largely military officers and disproportionately Naval officers. One U.S. Navy student had a great example to make Hazlitt's point. He pointed out it's not a good idea to pay workers making aircraft carriers high enough wages that each of them could buy an aircraft carrier.
Here's an earlier discussion of the issue.
