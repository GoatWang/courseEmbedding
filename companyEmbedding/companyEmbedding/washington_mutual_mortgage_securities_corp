Washington Mutual, Inc., abbreviated to WaMu, was a savings bank holding company and the former owner of Washington Mutual Bank, which was the United States' largest savings and loan association until its collapse in 2008.[5][6][7][8][9]
On Thursday, September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) seized Washington Mutual Bank from Washington Mutual, Inc. and placed it into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The OTS took the action due to the withdrawal of $16.7 billion in deposits during a 9-day bank run (amounting to 9% of the deposits it had held on June 30, 2008).[10] The FDIC sold the banking subsidiaries (minus unsecured debt and equity claims) to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion, which JPMorgan Chase had been planning to acquire as part of a confidential plan internally nicknamed Project West.[11][12][13] All WaMu branches were rebranded as Chase branches by the end of 2009. The holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc., was left with $33 billion in assets, and $8 billion debt, after being stripped of its banking subsidiary by the FDIC.[6][7][14][15] The next day, September 26, Washington Mutual, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 voluntary bankruptcy in Delaware, where it was incorporated.[7][14]
With respect to total assets under management, Washington Mutual Bank's closure and receivership is the largest bank failure in American financial history.[6][7] Before the receivership action, it was the sixth-largest bank in the United States.[16] According to Washington Mutual Inc.'s 2007 SEC filing, the holding company held assets valued at $327.9 billion.[17]
On March 20, 2009, Washington Mutual Inc. filed suit against the FDIC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking damages of approximately $13 billion for what it claims was an unjustified seizure and an extremely low sale price to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase promptly filed a counterclaim in the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, where the Washington Mutual bankruptcy proceedings had been continuing since the Office of Thrift Supervision's seizure of the holding company's bank subsidiaries.[18][19]

Business operations prior to bank receivership[edit]

Despite its name, Washington Mutual ceased being a mutual company in 1983 when it demutualized and became a public company on March 11.
On June 30, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank had total assets of US$307 billion, with 2,239 retail branch offices operating in 15 states, with 4,932 ATMs, and 43,198 employees. It held liabilities in the form of deposits of $188.3 billion, and owed $82.9 billion to the Federal Home Loan Bank, and had subordinated debt of $7.8 billion. It held as assets of $118.9 billion in single-family loans, of which $52.9 billion were "option adjustable rate mortgages" (Option ARMs), with $16 billion in subprime mortgage loans, and $53.4 billion of Home Equity lines of Credit (HELOCs) and credit cards receivables of $10.6 billion. It was servicing for itself and other banks loans totaling $689.7 billion, of which $442.7 were for other banks. It had non-performing assets of $11.6 billion, including $3.23 billion in payment option ARMs and $3.0 billion in subprime mortgage loans.[20]
On September 15, 2008, the holding company received a credit rating agency downgrade. From that date through September 24, 2008, WaMu experienced a bank run whereby customers withdrew $16.7 billion in deposits over those 9 days,[15] and in excess of $22 billion in cash outflow since July 2008, both conditions which ultimately led the Office of Thrift Supervision to close the bank.[20]
The FDIC then sold most of the bank's assets to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion in cash plus assumption of all secured debt and some unsecured debt. Claims of the subsidiary bank's equity holders, senior and subordinated debt (all primarily owned by the holding company) were not assumed by JPMorgan Chase[clarification needed].[7][21][22]
History[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower at 1201 Third Avenue in Seattle, Washington


Mutual savings bank[edit]
Washington Mutual was incorporated as the Washington National Building Loan and Investment Association on September 25, 1889, after the Great Seattle Fire destroyed 120 acres (49 ha) of the central business district of Seattle. The newly formed company made its first home mortgage loan on the West Coast on February 10, 1890. It changed its name to Washington Savings and Loan Association on June 25, 1908.[2] By September 12, 1917 it was operating under the name Washington Mutual Savings Bank.[23] The company purchased its first company, the financially distressed Continental Mutual Savings Bank, on July 25, 1930.[2] Its marketing slogan for much of its history was "The Friend of the Family".
Post demutualization growth[edit]
In April 1982, Washington Mutual purchased the brokerage firm Murphey Favre for undisclosed amount in cash[24] and demutualized the following year, converting into a capital stock savings bank.[25] Stock in the capital stock savings bank was first offered for sale on March 11, 1983.[26] By 1989, its assets had doubled.[2]
In November 1994, Washington Mutual formed a new holding called Washington Mutual, Inc. and separated its non-banking units from its primary banking unit, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, which was simultaneously renamed Washington Mutual Bank.[27][28][29] The company's stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under WAMU.
In October 2005, Washington Mutual purchased the formerly "subprime" credit card issuer Providian for approximately $6.5 billion, although Providian's new management team's strategy of targeting Prime credit card consumers had been underway since 2001, therefore the credit card unit's nonperforming loan portfolio had improved significantly prior to the company's sale to WaMu. In March 2006, Washington Mutual began the move into its new headquarters, WaMu Center, located in downtown Seattle. The company's previous headquarters, Washington Mutual Tower, stands about a block away from the new building on Second Avenue. In August 2006, Washington Mutual began using the official abbreviation of WaMu in all but legal situations.
Acquisitions[edit]

After the acquisition of Murphey Favre, WaMu made numerous acquisitions with the aim of expanding the corporation. By acquiring companies including PNC Mortgage, Fleet Mortgage and Homeside Lending, WaMu became the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. With the acquisition of Providian Financial Corporation in October 2005, WaMu became the nation's 9th-largest credit-card company.
A partial list of Washington Mutual acquisitions since demutualization:[30]

Commercial Capital Bancorp, California, 2006
Providian Financial Corporation, California, 2005
HomeSide Lending, Inc., Florida, a unit of National Australia Bank, 2002
Fleet Mortgage Corp., South Carolina, 2001
PNC Mortgage, Illinois, 2001
Alta Residential Mortgage Trust, California, 2000
Long Beach Financial Corp., California, 1999


Many of Washington Mutual's acquisitions became reviled as the rapid post-merger integrations resulted in numerous errors. The purchase of the original PNC Mortgage came at a time when subprime lending was in a "boom" period, with PNC Financial Services believing that the market was too volatile.[31] (PNC later re-entered the mortgage market in 2009 through its acquisition of National City Corp., with no plans to re-enter subprime lending.) The Dime merger resulted in account ownership to be split with account beneficiaries. The Fleet Mortgage merger resulted in entire loans simply disappearing — being serviced, but unable to be found by customer service representatives.[citation needed]
Expansion in Washington[edit]
In April 1983, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of three branch offices from the Tacoma-based United Mutual Savings Bank for $3.25 million.[32]

In January 1990, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of all seven offices of the Seattle-based Old Stone Bank of Washington from the Rhode Island-based Old Stone Corporation for an undisclosed amount.[39][40][41] Old Stone originally entered the state of Washington through the acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association in 1985 with the assistance of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.[42][43][44] The acquisition by Washington Mutual was completed in June 1990 for $10 million.[45][46]

In December 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of both Washington state branch offices of the California-based World Savings and Loan Association of America, a subsidiary of Golden West Financial, for an undisclosed amount.[58] The acquisition by was completed in March 1992.[59]
In August 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Lynnwood-based Pioneer Savings Bank for $181 million in stock.[60][61][62] The acquisition by was completed in March 1993.[63]
 In October 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Pacific First Financial Corporation with its Pacific First Bank subsidiary for $663 million from its Canada-based parent Royal Trustco. The acquisition was contingent on having Pacific First dispose of its branch offices in California and having its Canadian parent Royal Trustco assume all of Pacific First's bad loans.[64][65][66] The acquisition by was completed in April 1993.[67] At the time of the initial announcement in October 1992, Washington Mutual had 118 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Pacific First had 127 branch offices in Washington, Oregon and California. Pacific First had previously announced that it was trading its California offices for Great Western's Washington offices. As a result of the Pacific First acquisition, Washington Mutual became one of the largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits in the state of Washington, second only to Seafirst.[66]
In June 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Summit Bancorp with its Summit Savings Bank subsidiary for $25 million in stock.[68] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 231 branch offices in Washington and Oregon.

Unlike the previous acquisition targets, Enterprise held a commercial bank charter and not a thrift charter.
Expansion in Oregon[edit]
In April 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the 25 offices in the Portland, Oregon / Vancouver, Washington area from the ailing New York-based CrossLand Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Brooklyn Bancorp, for an undisclosed amount.[73] The acquisition by was completed in November 1991.[52] Seven of the 25 offices were located in Washington with the remainder in Oregon. As part of the transaction, CrossLand Savings closed seven offices in Oregon and three offices in Washington, leaving eleven offices in Oregon and four in Washington.[52] CrossLand had previously entered Oregon (and three other states) through the relatively recent acquisition of the troubled Utah-based Western Savings and Loan Association.[74][75][76] The CrossLand acquisition gave Washington Mutual a toe hold entry into Oregon via Portland.
As a result of the Pacific First acquisition in April 1993, Washington Mutual became the fourth largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits within the state of Oregon.[66] Originally, Pacific First grew quickly in Oregon during the late 1980s through the acquisition of troubled savings and loans.[77][78] By February 1991, Pacific First had 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift.[79] Pacific First had 71 branches in Oregon by July 1992.[80]
In April 1994, Washington Mutual announced the completed acquisition of three Portland-area offices of the failed Portland-based Far West Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $2.2 million.[81]
In October 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Coos Bay-based Western Bank for $156 million in stock.[82][83][84][85] The acquisition by was completed in February 1996.[86] Since Western Bank possessed a commercial bank charter and not a more restrictive savings & loan charter, Washington Mutual decided to allow Western Bank to keep its charter and name and to remain semi-autonomous for a while. At the time of the acquisition, Western Bank had 41 offices throughout Oregon. Five years later, Washington Mutual decided to abandon the Western Bank brand and integrate most of the former Western Bank offices into the existing Washington Mutual network in Oregon in 2001.[87][88] Due to branch overlaps between the two brands, 12 Western Bank branch offices and one Washington Mutual branch office were sold to the Klamath Falls-based Klamath First Bancorp for $33 million.[89][90]
Expansion in Idaho[edit]
In March 1994, Washington Mutual announced that they were planning to expand into the state of Idaho by building new branch offices inside Fred Meyer supermarket stores with the first three being opened in the Boise-area in July and August.[91][92][93][94]
In the following year, Washington Mutual opened a fourth Idaho location in a Moscow supermarket in February 1995.[95]
A branch office in Idaho Falls was acquired from the Utah-based United Savings Bank when Washington Mutual purchased the savings bank in January 1997.[96]
By March 2000, there were 9 locations within Idaho[97] and later 22 locations in 2008 when Chase acquired Washington Mutual.[98]
Expansion in Utah[edit]
In July 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank, FSB, subsidiary for $52.1 million in stock.[99][100] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 250 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Olympus had eight branch offices in Utah and two in Montana. The acquisition by was completed in May 1995.[101]
In March 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Ogden-based Utah Federal Savings Bank for an undisclosed amount.[102][103] At the time of the announcement, Utah Federal had five branch offices while Washington Mutual had 16 within Utah.

In September 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based United Western Financial Group Inc. with its United Savings Bank subsidiary for $80.3 million in cash.[105][106][107][108] At the time of the announcement, United Savings Bank had eight branch offices in Utah and one in Idaho. The acquisition by was completed in January 1997.[96]
Expansion in Montana[edit]
In May 1995, Washington Mutual acquired two branch offices in Butte as the result of the acquisition of the Utah-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank FSB subsidiary. Four years later, Washington Mutual later sold the two offices to Glacier Bancorp in 1999 for an undisclosed amount and quietly left the state of Montana.[109][110]
Expansion in California[edit]
 In July 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Fort Worth, Texas-based Keystone Holdings Inc. with its Irvine-based American Savings Bank subsidiary for $1.6 billion in stock.[111][112][113][114][115][116] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 317 branch offices in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana while American Savings Bank had 220 branch offices in California.[115] The acquisition by was completed in December 1996.[117][118][119][120] American kept its name after the acquisition. The result of the acquisition nearly doubled the total deposits of all Washington Mutual subsidiaries from $22 billion to $42 billion.
In February 1997, the Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial, the holding company for second largest thrift in the nation Great Western Bank, found itself the target of a hostile takeover attempt of arch-rival H. F. Ahmanson & Co., the holding company for the largest thrift in the nation Home Savings of America, that would have involved $5.8 billion worth of stock. Since the two companies had large overlapping territories, many Great Western offices would have been closed by the victor if the takeover attempt had succeeded.[121][122][123] The only way the combat a hostile takeover was to find another company, called a white knight that would allow a merger on much better terms. One such company was Washington Mutual. In March, Great Western Financial announced that it had accepted Washington Mutual's merger proposal for $6.6 billion in Washington Mutual stock.[124][125][126] Ahmanson quickly increased their bids[127] but the bids were also rejected.[128] Great Western approved the merger with Washington Mutual in June[129] and the merger was completed in July.[130][131] As part of its merger agreement, it was originally announced that Great Western offices would be allowed to keep the Great Western name and there were later discussion of converting the American Savings offices to the Great Western brand. In the end, it was felt that it was best for the company to have only one brand throughout the nation instead of multiple regional brands so it was announce in December 1997 that both Great Western and American names would be retired in favor of the Washington Mutual name.[132] The previous month, it was announced in November that 85 redundant branch offices were identified in California and were to be closed within the following year.[133][134] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 413 branch operating under various names across the country while Great Western had 416 branch offices operating in California and Florida.[135]
In March 1998, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irwindale-based H. F. Ahmanson & Company with its Home Savings of America subsidiary for approximately $10 billion in stock.[136][137][138] The acquisition by was completed in October 1998 for only $6.9 billion in stock.[139] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 892 branch operating under various names (Washington Mutual, American Savings, Great Western, etc.) across the country while Home Savings had 409 branch offices operating in California and Texas.[140][141] A few days after the completion of the merger, Washington Mutual announces plans to close 161 branch offices in California.[142][143]
Expansion in Texas[edit]
Through the 1998 acquisition of Home Savings, Washington Mutual had gained 48 branch offices in Texas.
In August 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Houston-based Bank United Corporation with its 155 branch offices, all located in Texas, for $1.49 billion in stock.[144][145][146] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[147][148]
As a result of branch overlap between Bank United and Washington Mutual, 17 branch offices were closed in Texas, 10 of which were in Houston.[149] [150]
Expansion in New York[edit]
In June 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the New York City-based Dime Bancorp with its Dime Savings Bank subsidiary for $5.2 billion in cash and stock.[151][152] The acquisition by was completed in January 2002.[153] Dime had 123 branch offices in the New York City area of both New York and New Jersey.[154]
Commercial banking[edit]
With a thrift charter, there were a few things that Washington Mutual was not able to do until it was able to obtain a commercial bank charter, such as making commercial loans above a certain size. To get around this problem, Washington Mutual began to purchase commercial banks and maintain them as separate business entities. In August 1995, Washington Mutual acquired the one office Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank in Washington. A few months later, Washington Mutual acquired the 41 office Coos Bay-based Western Bank in Oregon.[86] By 2007, Enterprise was merged into Western and operated as branch of Western.[155]
After Washington Mutual expanded into California through the acquisitions of American Savings, Great Western, and Home Savings, Washington Mutual quietly acquired the one-office Industrial Bank in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles an undisclosed amount in 1999[156][157] and renamed it WM Business Bank.[156]
By 2001, Washington Mutual had 38 specialized business banking centers operating under the Western Bank name in the Northwest and the WM Business Bank name in California when they decided to exit the commercial banking market that was then dominated with the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America.[87]
Mortgage banking[edit]
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Washington Mutual decided to aggressively expand in the subprime mortgage lending field through the acquisition of existing mortgage companies at a time when other financial institutions were leaving.
In May 1999, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Orange, California-based Long Beach Financial Corporation with its Long Beach Mortgage Company subsidiary for $350.4 million in cash and stock.[158][159] The acquisition by was completed in October 1999.[160] Long Beach had specialized in providing subprime mortgages. Some of Long Beach's questionable business practices may have led to Washington Mutual's failure in 2008.[161]
In January 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Los Angeles-based Alta Residential Mortgage Trust for $23 million.[162]
In October 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based PNC Mortgage Corporation and PNC Mortgage Securities Corporation from the PNC Financial Services Group for $605 million in cash.[163][164] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[165] The result of the PNC Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's third-largest lender.
In April 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Columbia, South Carolina-based Fleet Mortgage Corporation from FleetBoston Financial for $660 million in cash.[166] The acquisition by was completed in June 2001.[167] The result of the Fleet Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's second-largest mortgage-servicing business.
In December 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Jacksonville, Florida-based HomeSide Lending, Inc. from the National Australia Bank for $1.9 billion. The agreement did not include the mortgage servicing rights and related financial hedges for the business.[168][169] The acquisition by was completed in March 2002.[170] In August 2002, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the rest of HomeSide that included the mortgage servicing rights on a mortgage portfolio worth about $131 billion for $1.3 billion in cash and the assumption of $735 million in debt.[171] The acquisition by was completed in October 2002.[172]
In July 2002, the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Capital Corporation announced the pending sale of the mortgage loan portfolio for its Bay View Bank subsidiary to Washington Mutual for a "slight premium to book value".[173] The sale by was completed in the following month.[174]
In April 2006, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irvine, California-based Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. with its Commercial Capital Bank FSB subsidiary for $983 million in cash.[175][176] The acquisition by was completed in October 2006.[177] Commercial Capital had specialized in loans for the multifamily and small commercial real estate lending markets and was the third largest multifamily lender in California.
Rise and fall[edit]
"Wal-Mart of Banking"[edit]
Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger had pledged in 2003: "We hope to do to this industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe's, Home Depot did to their industry. And I think if we’ve done our job, five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank."[178]
Killinger's goal was to build WaMu into the "Wal-Mart of Banking", which would cater to lower- and middle-class consumers that other banks deemed too risky. Complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing, a strategy the bank extended in big cities, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. WaMu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets. WaMu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than $10,000 for bringing in borrowers. Variable-rate loans — Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (Option ARMs) in particular — were especially attractive, because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed WaMu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred. As WaMu was selling many of its loans to investors, it worried less about defaults.[9][178]
Subprime losses[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower (center right) in downtown Seattle was Washington Mutual's corporate headquarters from 1988 until 2006, when the company moved into the new WaMu Center (center left). These buildings have since been renamed; Washington Mutual Tower is now known as 1201 Third Avenue and WaMu Center is now known as Russell Investments Center.


In December 2007, the subsidiary Washington Mutual Bank reorganized its home-loan division, closing 160 of its 336 home-loan offices and removing 2,600 positions in its home-loan staff (a 22% reduction).[179]
In March 2008, on the same weekend that JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon negotiated the takeover of Bear Stearns, he secretly dispatched members of his team to Seattle to meet with WaMu executives, urging them to consider a quick deal. However, WaMu Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger rejected JPMorgan Chase's offer that valued WaMu at $8 a share, mostly in stock.[9][178]
In April 2008, the holding company, responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis, announced that 3,000 people companywide would lose their jobs, and the company stated its intent to close its approximately 176 remaining stand-alone, home-loan offices, including 23 in Washington and a loan-processing center in Bellevue, Washington. It stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as "wholesale lending." WaMu also announced a $7 billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by TPG Capital. TPG agreed to pump $2 billion into the Washington Mutual holding company; other investors, including some of WaMu's current institutional holders, agreed to buy an additional $5 billion in newly issued stock. This angered many investors, as TPG's investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, and as WaMu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses.[180]
In June 2008, Kerry Killinger stepped down as the Chairman, though remaining the Chief Executive Officer.[181] On September 8, 2008, under pressure from investors, the Washington Mutual holding company's board of directors dismissed Killinger as the CEO. Alan H. Fishman, chairman of mortgage broker Meridian Capital Group, and a former chief operating officer of Sovereign Bank, was named the new CEO for 17 days.[182]
Seizure by OTS and FDIC[edit]
By mid-September 2008, WaMu's share price had closed as low as $2.00. It had been worth over $30.00 in September 2007, and had briefly traded as high as $45 in the previous year.[183] While WaMu publicly insisted it could stay independent, earlier in the month it had quietly hired Goldman Sachs to identify potential bidders. However, several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid.[16] At the same time, WaMu suffered a massive run (mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfer[citation needed]); customers pulled out $16.7 billion in deposits in a ten-day span.[184]
This led the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to step up pressure for WaMu to find a buyer, as a takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could have been a severe drain on the FDIC insurance fund, which had already been hard hit by the failure of IndyMac that year. The FDIC ultimately held a secret auction of Washington Mutual Bank. Finally, on the morning of Thursday, September 25 (which happened to be the 119th anniversary of WaMu's establishment), regulators informed JPMorgan Chase that they were the winners.[16]
On Thursday night (shortly after the close of business on the West Coast), the Office of Thrift Supervision seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC. In a statement, the OTS said that the massive run meant that WaMu was no longer sound.[184] The FDIC, as receiver, sold most of Washington Mutual Bank's assets, including the branch network, to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. JPMorgan agreed to assume the bank's secured debts and liabilities to depositors. The transaction did not require any FDIC insurance funds.[185] Normally, bank seizures take place after the close of business on Fridays. However, due to the bank's deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent, regulators felt compelled to act a day early.[16]
Because JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual's assets for a low price, WaMu's stockholders were nearly wiped out. Its stock price dropped to $0.16 a share, far from $45 a share in 2007.[183] In its Chapter 11 filing, WaMu listed assets of $33 billion and debt of $8 billion. (ref. Appendix A). The filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors.
Within days of the seizure, a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist, Mike Stathis of AVA Investment Analytics, issued a formal complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, demonstrating evidence of insider trading. The complaint also alleged that Washington Mutual was not insolvent, and several Wall Street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock. He also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press who told him that he was contacted by a Washington Mutual executive hours before the seizure, telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons.” In later criticisms, Stathis discussed that neither the FDIC nor OTS ever disclosed any evidence of Washington Mutual's insolvency.[186] Stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint, he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning. As a result of this, Stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the SEC complaint into the public domain until a year later.[187][188]
Shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of Washington Mutual through such websites as WaMuCoup.com (dead link) and others, claiming that the OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of JPMorgan Chase, which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price. Shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover, the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the OTS 2 weeks earlier[189] and that the holding company's board and management was kept completely in the dark about the government's negotiations with Chase, hampering the bank's ability to sell itself on its own. Chief executive Alan H. Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed, and eventually received a $7.5 million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6 million (which he declined) after being CEO for 17 days.[190] Senator Maria Cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation[191] and Washington Mutual's former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares.[189]
The seizure of WaMu Bank resulted in the largest bank failure in American financial history, far exceeding the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984.[16][192][193]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc., and its remaining subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[194] Washington Mutual, Inc., was promptly delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and commenced trading via Pink Sheets. The bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks, after the Lehman Brothers filing eleven days earlier; both bankruptcies far outpaced WorldCom's 2002 filing, which had held the record with just under $104 billion in assets (Washington Mutual's alone, which was approximately half that of Lehman Brothers, was three times as much as WorldCom's).
All assets but only some liabilities (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank were assumed by JPMorgan Chase.[195] Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase acquired all the banking operations of WaMu, including $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits, for a price of $1.9 billion plus debt assumptions.[196] Unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the FDIC, leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery.[195] On Friday, Sep. 26, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank customers were informed that Deposits held by Washington Mutual became now liabilities of JPMorgan Chase.[197]
The IRS claimed $12.5 billion in back taxes from Washington Mutual, Inc.. The company filed court papers on January 22, 2009 alleging losses were $20 billion, and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt, stating that the IRS could owe Washington Mutual Inc. a tax refund.[198] In a settlement between Wash. Mutual Inc. (in receivership), the FDIC, and JPMorgan Chase that Wash. Mutual Inc. recently made public, a tax refund of about US$5.7 billion will be shared between Wash. Mutual Inc., JPMorgan Chase and FDIC.[199]
Washington Mutual, Inc., sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for US$13 billion after the sale of its banking operations to JPMorgan Chase.[200] WMI attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank, and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken.
On January 11, 2010, the United States Department of Justice, Office of the United States Trustee, District of Delaware, pursuant to Section 1102(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, appointed a Committee of Equity Security Holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock. All of the Motions to Disband the Committee of Equity Security Holders were denied on January 28, 2010 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath, District of Delaware.[201][202]
On July 20, 2010, bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath approved a motion of the EC for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of WMI, handing a victory to shareholders. The Judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase at the heart of WaMu's reorganization, but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company.[203]
On July 26, 2010, U.S. Trustee Roberta A. DeAngelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP partner Joshua R. Hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC. Hochberg is a partner in McKenna Long & Aldridge's Washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense, internal investigations and compliance.[204]
On August 10, 2010, the bankruptcy judge rejected Washington Mutual Inc.'s effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting. Attorneys for the EC said that WMI was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information. The judge agreed that WMI was not entitled to the information.[205]
On November 1, 2010, examiner Joshua R. Hochberg from McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP presented his long-awaited report, but it did not meet the expectations of the court, since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorney-client work. On December 12, the court decided to exclude the examiner's report during the plan confirmation hearings, saying it can't be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions.[206]
On January 7, 2011, the bankruptcy court rejected the 6th proposed plan of reorganization, which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Judge Mary Walrath focused many of her criticisms on the company's releases of liability granted to directors, officers and others including some hedge funds, who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement. She noted for example that shareholders, who will likely get nothing, should not have to release the company's board from the threat of being sued by them.[207] However, many WaMu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when Washington Mutual emerges from bankruptcy.
On September 14, 2011, the court also rejected the modified 6th proposed plan of reorganization. Judge Mary F. Walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt. The four hedge funds are Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management.[208]
A seventh plan of reorganization was announced in February 2012[209][210] and the company finally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month as WMI Holdings Corporation.[211] By 2015, WMI Holdings was able to raise $598 million and was looking for new acquisitions.[212]
Post receivership bank operations[edit]
During 2009, all of the Washington Mutual Bank branches that had been purchased from the FDIC after the bank had been placed into receivership, were rebranded to Chase or shuttered. All financial documents issued by WaMu were changed to carry the JPMorgan Chase logo. Credit and debit cards issued by WaMu or Providian were changed to carry the Chase logo.
Since 2009, Chase ATMs have been accessible for WaMu customers at no extra charge, and the branches and accounts were formally merged in 2009 as the WaMu brand was retired.[16] Branches in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Utah were rebranded in May 2009; branches in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Greater New York were rebranded in July 2009, and the remaining branches in Nevada, California, Arizona, and Colorado were rebranded in October 2009.[213][214] The last rebrandings formally retired the WaMu name.
In markets where Chase already had a dominant presence, such as Greater New York and Chicago owing to the presence of Chase and predecessor Bank One (in New York, the merger resulted in different branches on the same block), Chase further disposed of such branches to other banks.[215]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
"Free Checking Account"[edit]
This advertising campaign was introduced between 2005 and 2007. Numerous WaMu commercials showed traditionally-dressed 60-70-year-old overweight bankers laughing out loud at a WaMu representative (who is much younger and fitter), who says the words "Free Checking Account".
"The Power of Yes"[edit]
WaMu introduced an advertising campaign during the 2003 Academy Awards known as “The Power of Yes”. This was to promote the offering of loans to all consumers, particularly borrowers that the banks deemed too risky. Another commercial in the ad series showed WaMu representatives in casual clothes, contrasting with traditionally-dressed bankers in suits.
"Whoo hoo"[edit]




A promotional Washington Mutual "Whoo hoo!" bumper sticker.


"Whoo hoo!" was an advertising campaign introduced by Washington Mutual in February 2008. As fears of an economic crisis were rising, and WaMu was looking to become an "iconic brand that people love", they began courting consumers with a new slogan, designed to position WaMu as a consumer-friendly institution.[216]
During its run, the Whoo hoo! ads, created by TBWA\Chiat\Day of Playa del Rey, California,[216] become widespread in web navigation.[217] After WaMu launched the new advertisement, there was double digit growth at its website[217] and the term “wamu” appeared in searches over 1,000% more between January and March than in all of 2007.[217]
Washington Mutual (before the bank's September 2008 conservatorship and sale to JPMorgan Chase) applied to register a trademark in the phrase.[218][219] Initially, the bank wanted to use "woo hoo" (without the "h" in the first word) as the slogan, but they were concerned because of the existing use of the phrase by Homer Simpson, a character in The Simpsons.[218]
Occasio branch design[edit]
Washington Mutual introduced a unique branch design known as Occasio which eliminated traditional teller windows and queuing stanchions in favor of an open, circular floor plan with a greeter or "concierge" position and tellers working from behind podiums.[220][221] The Occasio design was introduced in 2000 and patented in 2004,[222] but was phased out following the JPMorgan Chase acquisition of Washington Mutual's retail banking operations.[223]

In one of the Pacific Northwest's biggest financial transactions of its kind, Washington Mutual Savings Bank said today it won the sweepstakes to take control of Pacific First Financial Corp., parent company to Pacific First Bank. The move will make Washington Mutual the second-largest financial institution in Washington and give it a huge initial presence in Oregon. Washington Mutual said it will pay $663 million for the rival institution - both have Seattle headquarters. After the deal is done next May or June, Washington Mutual will be second in size here only to Seafirst Bank. Just three years ago, then publicly held Pacific First was acquired by Royal Trustco of Toronto, Canada, for $212 million. But since then, Royal Trustco has run into problems elsewhere, and decided to abandon its strategy to string branches along the West Coast of the United States. It put Pacific First up for bid.

^ a b c Virgin, Bill (October 28, 1992). "Washington Mutual Plans to Buy Pacific First Bank". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. p. B5. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Savings Bank will buy Pacific First Bank in a deal that cements its position as one of the three leading financial institutions in the Pacific Northwest. It also brings to a somewhat messy and expensive end a foray into the American banking market by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, parent of Pacific First. While Royal Trustco is giving up its dream of building an American banking empire anchored in Seattle, it will be stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate loans that are in default or heading that way. And the $663 million acquisition of Pacific First Financial Corp. marks the third major upheaval of banking in Washington in a year, which will mean more sign changes, building closures and potential layoffs for employees. Washington Mutual already has $8.4 billion in assets and 118 branches and 17 loan centers in Washington and Oregon. Pacific First has assets of $6.9 billion, 127 branches in Washington, Oregon and California and eight mortgage offices. It previously agreed to trade its 10 California branches for Great Western Bank's 14 Washington branches. Once the Pacific First deal is completed, Washington Mutual will have assets of about $14 billion... Pacific First is merely the latest in a series of acquisitions Washington Mutual has made in the last few years, including Pioneer Savings in Lynnwood, Great Northwest in Bremerton and VanFed in Vancouver. With Pacific First's branches, Washington Mutual's share of consumer deposits in Washington will be 17.2 percent, ahead of KeyCorp-Puget Sound with 10.3 percent and trailing only Seafirst at 20.4 percent, Tejera said. In Oregon, Washington Mutual will become the fourth biggest in consumer deposits.

^ MacKenzie, Bill (February 22, 1991). "Pacific First Tops Oregon Thrifts". The Oregonian. p. E15. (Subscription required (help)). Pacific First Bank, a Seattle-based thrift, has quietly become the largest holder of deposits among all thrifts operating in Oregon. It also operates 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift. Its rise has been due, in part, to turmoil in the thrift industry that has led to deposit declines at competitors and the shift of one large thrift to a bank. Pacific First had $1.1 billion in deposits at its Oregon branches at the end of 1989. A year later, deposits had grown to $2.3 billion. It now holds about 27 percent of the thrift market in Oregon and about 9 percent of the combined thrift and bank market. The next-largest Oregon thrift is Far West Federal Bank with $1.3 billion in deposits... Pacific First has been serving Oregonians since 1936, but it had only a few branches until December 1988, when it bought 17 branches of Salem-based American Home Savings. One year later the thrift was acquired by Toronto, Canada-based Royal Trustco, Canada's largest trust company, which injected $100 million of capital into the thrift and set it on an aggressive expansion course. Pacific First acquired the 45 branches of Willamette Savings and Loan in June and added the 12 Oregon branches of the Williamsburg Federal Savings and Loan Association in September. Some recently acquired branches have been closed, leaving the thrift with 78 Oregon branches spread throughout the state, but principally in the Portland metropolitan area and the Willamette Valley.

Washington Mutual has traditionally emphasized the thrift business, which means home mortgage and consumer loans.

In addition, because American's loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward adjustable rate mortgages, the acquisition helps Washington Mutual reduce its vulnerability to interest rate swings...

Washington Mutual Inc., a Seattle financial services firm, said Monday it will buy American Savings Bank and its parent company in a stock for stock transaction worth $3.5 billion. Irvine-based American Savings Bank will keep its name, and officials said they expect all branches to remain open, officials said... Washington Mutual, which owns a network of banks, is the No. 1 residential mortgage originator in Washington and Oregon. American Savings is California's second largest home-mortgage originator. The deal gives Washington Mutual its first presence in California, allowing an immediate foothold in key locations that will solidify its West Coast position... Robert M. Bass and his investor group control Keystone Holdings Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, the parent company of American Savings. After the acquisition, Keystone will be merged into Washington Mutual. The investor group will get 26 million of the 48 million shares to be issued by Washington Mutual in the merger. With total outstanding shares of 117.5 million, the group's share amounts to a 22 percent ownership in the new company, with Bass holding an 8 percent stake. About 14 million of the new shares will go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will sell them after the merger. The rest will be held in escrow pending the outcome of a Keystone lawsuit against the federal government. Washington Mutual also will assume Keystone's $365 million of debt and $80 million in outstanding preferred stock. Mario Antoci, American Savings' chairman and CEO, will retire after the deal closes. Post-merger management changes have not been finalized. Antoci took over American Savings in 1988, when the Bass Group bought it. American Savings Bank was originally part of American Savings and Loan, a failed thrift that led to the largest savings and loan bailout in history. The original thrift was divided into two parts: American Savings Bank controlled the profitable assets and loans while the other unit was liquidated. American Savings Bank has 220 branches in California and Arizona. Washington Mutual has 317 branches in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana.

An investment group led by Fort Worth billionaire Robert M. Bass cashed in on a $400 million investment in California's American Savings yesterday, selling the thrift it acquired less than eight years ago. The deal was valued at more than $1.6 billion. Washington Mutual Inc., the parent of one of Washington state's largest savings banks, agreed to acquire the thrift for at least 40 million shares of Washington Mutual stock. That stock was worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at Friday's closing price. Washington Mutual will also assume $465 million in debt as part of the deal... Bass made his investment through Keystone Holdings, in which he owns about 36 percent. In 1988, Keystone acquired American Savings from the federal government, which had seized the thrift in 1984. Keystone invested $350 million in cash into American Savings and spent another $50 million in expenses to buy the institution, which at the time was America's biggest insolvent thrift. Keystone installed Mario J. Antoci, a respected thrift executive, to run American Savings. The thrift, stripped of its most troubled assets, immediately started making money... The Keystone group will also name two members of Washington Mutual's 13-person board, suggesting that the group is likely to retain its interest in the company.

Hoping to marry the nation's two largest savings and loans into a financial powerhouse, the corporate parent of Home Savings of America has offered to buy Great Western Financial Corp. in a deal valued at nearly $6 billion, sources close to the proposed transaction said late Monday. The unsolicited offer by Irwindale-based H.F. Ahmanson & Co. would form the third-largest financial institution in California--after giant Bank of America and Wells Fargo. It would also result in the closure of more than 100 bank branches and the probable loss of hundreds of jobs, sources said. 
^ "Great Western Spurns Ahmanson, Courts Rival Suitors". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. February 22, 1997. p. B8. (Subscription required (help)). Great Western Financial Corp. sought to buy time to fend off H.F. Ahmanson and Co.'s $6.2 billion takeover bid yesterday as its bankers met with potential rival suitors, sources close to Great Western said... Sources said possible bidders that Great Western may have contacted include First Bank System Inc., Washington Mutual Savings Bank and Norwest Corp. Local banking executives and analysts said Washington Mutual is likely to take a close look at a deal for Great Western, and said there are equally strong reasons why the Seattle-based thrift might bid or walk away. On the negative side, Washington Mutual is currently digesting a major California acquisition, a hurry-up deal wouldn't give it time to carefully review the transaction, it wouldn't get the same cost savings Ahmanson would to make the deal attractive, and a bidding war could become expensive.

Under the terms of the agreement, Washington Mutual will swap nine-tenths of a share of its stock for each share of Great Western, an offer worth about $6.6 billion based on yesterday's closing prices.

Washington Mutual Inc. completed its $8 billion acquisition of Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial Corp. on Wednesday, making it the largest savings and loan in the United States and expanding its presence in the resurgent California market. With the combination, Seattle-based Washington Mutual creates one of the biggest thrifts in the West, with $88.5 billion in assets, $52.5 billion in deposits and more than 1,150 branches in Washington, Oregon, California and Florida. The acquisition of Great Western, the second-largest U.S. thrift, also bolsters Washington Mutual's reputation as one of the most aggressive acquirers in the industry. Washington Mutual has completed 22 acquisitions and multiplied its assets more than twentyfold in 14 years.

Seattle-based Washington Mutual doubled its size to $90 billion in assets by buying Great Western Financial Corp., just months after the purchase of another California thrift doubled Washington Mutual to more than $40 billion in assets. Now comes the job of absorbing Great Western, a task complicated by the fact that this deal makes Washington Mutual a true coast-to-coast institution, with the addition of branches in Florida.

Ahmanson & Co. in a stock swap valued at $10.03 billion, or $81.69 a share, a transaction that would combine the nation's two largest thrift companies... The combined entity is to retain the Washington Mutual name and headquarters in Seattle.

Ahmanson is based in Irwindale, Calif... The deal, code-named "Project Grand Slam" by Washington Mutual, came together with startling speed. More than 60 Washington Mutual advisers registered under assumed names at the Doubletree Hotel in Pasadena, Calif., where they pored over Ahmanson's books, according to Philip Erlanger of Lehman Brothers, which advised Washington Mutual.  Alternate Link via ProQuest.

Washington Mutual Inc., looking to make itself as much a major player in Texas banking as it is in Washington and California, yesterday said it will buy a Houston-based company in a $1.5 billion stock deal. Seattle-based Washington Mutual will acquire Bank United Corp., the largest publicly traded Texas-based financial institution. Texas was something of an incidental market Washington Mutual picked up in its 1998 acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson & Co.; while the real prize in the Ahmanson deal was its huge share of the market in California, it also had 48 branches in Texas, primarily in Houston and Dallas... Bank United will provide that, with 155 branches, including 66 in Houston, 77 in Dallas-Fort Worth and a handful in Midland, Austin and San Antonio. 
^ Fuquay, Jim (August 22, 2000). "Bank United says yes to buyout - Washington Mutual to pay $1.5 billion in merger deal". Fort Worth Star-Telegram. p. 1. (Subscription required (help)). Bank United, the largest financial institution based in Texas, said yesterday that it agreed to be acquired by Washington Mutual, the nation's biggest savings and loan. The deal, valued at $1.5 billion and expected to close by year's end, will greatly increase Washington Mutual's presence in the state. The Seattle-based institution entered Texas in 1998 with its acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson & Co., parent of Savings of America, and the Bank United merger will give it 3 percent of Texas deposits, according to June 30, 1999, reports, the latest available. Washington Mutual, which ranks No. 8 among all U.S. banks and thrifts, also has a previous Texas connection. In 1995, it acquired American Savings, a California thrift owned by Fort Worth investor Robert M. Bass, who became a major Washington Mutual shareholder as a result of that deal. A Bass lieutenant, Jay Crandall, remains on Washington Mutual's board of directors... Bank United has 155 retail branches in the state, including 77 in North Texas, along with 42 commercial loan offices and 11 other sales offices. Washington Mutual has 48 branches in Texas, including two in Tarrant County... About a dozen Texas branches share overlapping market areas, the companies said. That includes downtown Fort Worth, where two branches are within blocks of each other.

For a company with $166 billion in assets and offices from coast to coast, the acquisition of Industrial Bank of Van Nuys, Calif., which has one office and $30 million in assets, created hardly a ripple. But the significance of the acquisition was not in the numbers, or Washington Mutual wouldn't have bothered making it.

Washington Mutual, Inc., abbreviated to WaMu, was a savings bank holding company and the former owner of Washington Mutual Bank, which was the United States' largest savings and loan association until its collapse in 2008.[5][6][7][8][9]
On Thursday, September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) seized Washington Mutual Bank from Washington Mutual, Inc. and placed it into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The OTS took the action due to the withdrawal of $16.7 billion in deposits during a 9-day bank run (amounting to 9% of the deposits it had held on June 30, 2008).[10] The FDIC sold the banking subsidiaries (minus unsecured debt and equity claims) to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion, which JPMorgan Chase had been planning to acquire as part of a confidential plan internally nicknamed Project West.[11][12][13] All WaMu branches were rebranded as Chase branches by the end of 2009. The holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc., was left with $33 billion in assets, and $8 billion debt, after being stripped of its banking subsidiary by the FDIC.[6][7][14][15] The next day, September 26, Washington Mutual, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 voluntary bankruptcy in Delaware, where it was incorporated.[7][14]
With respect to total assets under management, Washington Mutual Bank's closure and receivership is the largest bank failure in American financial history.[6][7] Before the receivership action, it was the sixth-largest bank in the United States.[16] According to Washington Mutual Inc.'s 2007 SEC filing, the holding company held assets valued at $327.9 billion.[17]
On March 20, 2009, Washington Mutual Inc. filed suit against the FDIC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking damages of approximately $13 billion for what it claims was an unjustified seizure and an extremely low sale price to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase promptly filed a counterclaim in the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, where the Washington Mutual bankruptcy proceedings had been continuing since the Office of Thrift Supervision's seizure of the holding company's bank subsidiaries.[18][19]

Business operations prior to bank receivership[edit]




A former WaMu branch in the Chinatown section of New York City (2004)


Despite its name, Washington Mutual ceased being a mutual company in 1983 when it demutualized and became a public company on March 11.
On June 30, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank had total assets of US$307 billion, with 2,239 retail branch offices operating in 15 states, with 4,932 ATMs, and 43,198 employees. It held liabilities in the form of deposits of $188.3 billion, and owed $82.9 billion to the Federal Home Loan Bank, and had subordinated debt of $7.8 billion. It held as assets of $118.9 billion in single-family loans, of which $52.9 billion were "option adjustable rate mortgages" (Option ARMs), with $16 billion in subprime mortgage loans, and $53.4 billion of Home Equity lines of Credit (HELOCs) and credit cards receivables of $10.6 billion. It was servicing for itself and other banks loans totaling $689.7 billion, of which $442.7 were for other banks. It had non-performing assets of $11.6 billion, including $3.23 billion in payment option ARMs and $3.0 billion in subprime mortgage loans.[20]
On September 15, 2008, the holding company received a credit rating agency downgrade. From that date through September 24, 2008, WaMu experienced a bank run whereby customers withdrew $16.7 billion in deposits over those 9 days,[15] and in excess of $22 billion in cash outflow since July 2008, both conditions which ultimately led the Office of Thrift Supervision to close the bank.[20]
The FDIC then sold most of the bank's assets to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion in cash plus assumption of all secured debt and some unsecured debt. Claims of the subsidiary bank's equity holders, senior and subordinated debt (all primarily owned by the holding company) were not assumed by JPMorgan Chase[clarification needed].[7][21][22]
History[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower at 1201 Third Avenue in Seattle, Washington


Mutual savings bank[edit]
Washington Mutual was incorporated as the Washington National Building Loan and Investment Association on September 25, 1889, after the Great Seattle Fire destroyed 120 acres (49 ha) of the central business district of Seattle. The newly formed company made its first home mortgage loan on the West Coast on February 10, 1890. It changed its name to Washington Savings and Loan Association on June 25, 1908.[2] By September 12, 1917 it was operating under the name Washington Mutual Savings Bank.[23] The company purchased its first company, the financially distressed Continental Mutual Savings Bank, on July 25, 1930.[2] Its marketing slogan for much of its history was "The Friend of the Family".
Post demutualization growth[edit]
In April 1982, Washington Mutual purchased the brokerage firm Murphey Favre for undisclosed amount in cash[24] and demutualized the following year, converting into a capital stock savings bank.[25] Stock in the capital stock savings bank was first offered for sale on March 11, 1983.[26] By 1989, its assets had doubled.[2]
In November 1994, Washington Mutual formed a new holding called Washington Mutual, Inc. and separated its non-banking units from its primary banking unit, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, which was simultaneously renamed Washington Mutual Bank.[27][28][29] The company's stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under WAMU.
In October 2005, Washington Mutual purchased the formerly "subprime" credit card issuer Providian for approximately $6.5 billion, although Providian's new management team's strategy of targeting Prime credit card consumers had been underway since 2001, therefore the credit card unit's nonperforming loan portfolio had improved significantly prior to the company's sale to WaMu. In March 2006, Washington Mutual began the move into its new headquarters, WaMu Center, located in downtown Seattle. The company's previous headquarters, Washington Mutual Tower, stands about a block away from the new building on Second Avenue. In August 2006, Washington Mutual began using the official abbreviation of WaMu in all but legal situations.
Acquisitions[edit]

After the acquisition of Murphey Favre, WaMu made numerous acquisitions with the aim of expanding the corporation. By acquiring companies including PNC Mortgage, Fleet Mortgage and Homeside Lending, WaMu became the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. With the acquisition of Providian Financial Corporation in October 2005, WaMu became the nation's 9th-largest credit-card company.
A partial list of Washington Mutual acquisitions since demutualization:[30]

Commercial Capital Bancorp, California, 2006
Providian Financial Corporation, California, 2005
HomeSide Lending, Inc., Florida, a unit of National Australia Bank, 2002
Fleet Mortgage Corp., South Carolina, 2001
PNC Mortgage, Illinois, 2001
Alta Residential Mortgage Trust, California, 2000
Long Beach Financial Corp., California, 1999


Many of Washington Mutual's acquisitions became reviled as the rapid post-merger integrations resulted in numerous errors. The purchase of the original PNC Mortgage came at a time when subprime lending was in a "boom" period, with PNC Financial Services believing that the market was too volatile.[31] (PNC later re-entered the mortgage market in 2009 through its acquisition of National City Corp., with no plans to re-enter subprime lending.) The Dime merger resulted in account ownership to be split with account beneficiaries. The Fleet Mortgage merger resulted in entire loans simply disappearing — being serviced, but unable to be found by customer service representatives.[citation needed]
Expansion in Washington[edit]
In April 1983, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of three branch offices from the Tacoma-based United Mutual Savings Bank for $3.25 million.[32]

In January 1990, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of all seven offices of the Seattle-based Old Stone Bank of Washington from the Rhode Island-based Old Stone Corporation for an undisclosed amount.[39][40][41] Old Stone originally entered the state of Washington through the acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association in 1985 with the assistance of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.[42][43][44] The acquisition by Washington Mutual was completed in June 1990 for $10 million.[45][46]

In December 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of both Washington state branch offices of the California-based World Savings and Loan Association of America, a subsidiary of Golden West Financial, for an undisclosed amount.[58] The acquisition by was completed in March 1992.[59]
In August 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Lynnwood-based Pioneer Savings Bank for $181 million in stock.[60][61][62] The acquisition by was completed in March 1993.[63]
 In October 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Pacific First Financial Corporation with its Pacific First Bank subsidiary for $663 million from its Canada-based parent Royal Trustco. The acquisition was contingent on having Pacific First dispose of its branch offices in California and having its Canadian parent Royal Trustco assume all of Pacific First's bad loans.[64][65][66] The acquisition by was completed in April 1993.[67] At the time of the initial announcement in October 1992, Washington Mutual had 118 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Pacific First had 127 branch offices in Washington, Oregon and California. Pacific First had previously announced that it was trading its California offices for Great Western's Washington offices. As a result of the Pacific First acquisition, Washington Mutual became one of the largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits in the state of Washington, second only to Seafirst.[66]
In June 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Summit Bancorp with its Summit Savings Bank subsidiary for $25 million in stock.[68] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 231 branch offices in Washington and Oregon.

Unlike the previous acquisition targets, Enterprise held a commercial bank charter and not a thrift charter.
Expansion in Oregon[edit]
In April 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the 25 offices in the Portland, Oregon / Vancouver, Washington area from the ailing New York-based CrossLand Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Brooklyn Bancorp, for an undisclosed amount.[73] The acquisition by was completed in November 1991.[52] Seven of the 25 offices were located in Washington with the remainder in Oregon. As part of the transaction, CrossLand Savings closed seven offices in Oregon and three offices in Washington, leaving eleven offices in Oregon and four in Washington.[52] CrossLand had previously entered Oregon (and three other states) through the relatively recent acquisition of the troubled Utah-based Western Savings and Loan Association.[74][75][76] The CrossLand acquisition gave Washington Mutual a toe hold entry into Oregon via Portland.
As a result of the Pacific First acquisition in April 1993, Washington Mutual became the fourth largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits within the state of Oregon.[66] Originally, Pacific First grew quickly in Oregon during the late 1980s through the acquisition of troubled savings and loans.[77][78] By February 1991, Pacific First had 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift.[79] Pacific First had 71 branches in Oregon by July 1992.[80]
In April 1994, Washington Mutual announced the completed acquisition of three Portland-area offices of the failed Portland-based Far West Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $2.2 million.[81]
In October 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Coos Bay-based Western Bank for $156 million in stock.[82][83][84][85] The acquisition by was completed in February 1996.[86] Since Western Bank possessed a commercial bank charter and not a more restrictive savings & loan charter, Washington Mutual decided to allow Western Bank to keep its charter and name and to remain semi-autonomous for a while. At the time of the acquisition, Western Bank had 41 offices throughout Oregon. Five years later, Washington Mutual decided to abandon the Western Bank brand and integrate most of the former Western Bank offices into the existing Washington Mutual network in Oregon in 2001.[87][88] Due to branch overlaps between the two brands, 12 Western Bank branch offices and one Washington Mutual branch office were sold to the Klamath Falls-based Klamath First Bancorp for $33 million.[89][90]
Expansion in Idaho[edit]
In March 1994, Washington Mutual announced that they were planning to expand into the state of Idaho by building new branch offices inside Fred Meyer supermarket stores with the first three being opened in the Boise-area in July and August.[91][92][93][94]
In the following year, Washington Mutual opened a fourth Idaho location in a Moscow supermarket in February 1995.[95]
A branch office in Idaho Falls was acquired from the Utah-based United Savings Bank when Washington Mutual purchased the savings bank in January 1997.[96]
By March 2000, there were 9 locations within Idaho[97] and later 22 locations in 2008 when Chase acquired Washington Mutual.[98]
Expansion in Utah[edit]
In July 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank, FSB, subsidiary for $52.1 million in stock.[99][100] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 250 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Olympus had eight branch offices in Utah and two in Montana. The acquisition by was completed in May 1995.[101]
In March 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Ogden-based Utah Federal Savings Bank for an undisclosed amount.[102][103] At the time of the announcement, Utah Federal had five branch offices while Washington Mutual had 16 within Utah. The acquisition by was completed in December 1996 for $15.2 million.[104]
In September 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based United Western Financial Group Inc. with its United Savings Bank subsidiary for $80.3 million in cash.[105][106][107][108] At the time of the announcement, United Savings Bank had eight branch offices in Utah and one in Idaho. The acquisition by was completed in January 1997.[96]
Expansion in Montana[edit]
In May 1995, Washington Mutual acquired two branch offices in Butte as the result of the acquisition of the Utah-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank FSB subsidiary. Four years later, Washington Mutual later sold the two offices to Glacier Bancorp in 1999 for an undisclosed amount and quietly left the state of Montana.[109][110]
Expansion in California[edit]
 In July 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Fort Worth, Texas-based Keystone Holdings Inc. with its Irvine-based American Savings Bank subsidiary for $1.6 billion in stock.[111][112][113][114][115][116] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 317 branch offices in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana while American Savings Bank had 220 branch offices in California.[115] The acquisition by was completed in December 1996.[117][118][119][120] American kept its name after the acquisition. The result of the acquisition nearly doubled the total deposits of all Washington Mutual subsidiaries from $22 billion to $42 billion.
In February 1997, the Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial, the holding company for second largest thrift in the nation Great Western Bank, found itself the target of a hostile takeover attempt of arch-rival H. F. Ahmanson & Co., the holding company for the largest thrift in the nation Home Savings of America, that would have involved $5.8 billion worth of stock. Since the two companies had large overlapping territories, many Great Western offices would have been closed by the victor if the takeover attempt had succeeded.[121][122][123] The only way the combat a hostile takeover was to find another company, called a white knight that would allow a merger on much better terms. One such company was Washington Mutual. In March, Great Western Financial announced that it had accepted Washington Mutual's merger proposal for $6.6 billion in Washington Mutual stock.[124][125][126] Ahmanson quickly increased their bids[127] but the bids were also rejected.[128] Great Western approved the merger with Washington Mutual in June[129] and the merger was completed in July.[130][131] As part of its merger agreement, it was originally announced that Great Western offices would be allowed to keep the Great Western name and there were later discussion of converting the American Savings offices to the Great Western brand. In the end, it was felt that it was best for the company to have only one brand throughout the nation instead of multiple regional brands so it was announce in December 1997 that both Great Western and American names would be retired in favor of the Washington Mutual name.[132] The previous month, it was announced in November that 85 redundant branch offices were identified in California and were to be closed within the following year.[133][134] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 413 branch operating under various names across the country while Great Western had 416 branch offices operating in California and Florida.[135]
In March 1998, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irwindale-based H. F. Ahmanson & Company with its Home Savings of America subsidiary for approximately $10 billion in stock.[136][137][138] The acquisition by was completed in October 1998 for only $6.9 billion in stock.[139] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 892 branch operating under various names (Washington Mutual, American Savings, Great Western, etc.) across the country while Home Savings had 409 branch offices operating in California and Texas.[140][141] A few days after the completion of the merger, Washington Mutual announces plans to close 161 branch offices in California.[142][143]
Expansion in Texas[edit]
Through the 1998 acquisition of Home Savings, Washington Mutual had gained 48 branch offices in Texas.
In August 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Houston-based Bank United Corporation with its 155 branch offices, all located in Texas, for $1.49 billion in stock.[144][145][146] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[147][148]
As a result of branch overlap between Bank United and Washington Mutual, 17 branch offices were closed in Texas, 10 of which were in Houston.[149] [150]
Expansion in New York[edit]
In June 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the New York City-based Dime Bancorp with its Dime Savings Bank subsidiary for $5.2 billion in cash and stock.[151][152] The acquisition by was completed in January 2002.[153] Dime had 123 branch offices in the New York City area of both New York and New Jersey.[154]
Commercial banking[edit]
With a thrift charter, there were a few things that Washington Mutual was not able to do until it was able to obtain a commercial bank charter, such as making commercial loans above a certain size. To get around this problem, Washington Mutual began to purchase commercial banks and maintain them as separate business entities. In August 1995, Washington Mutual acquired the one office Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank in Washington. A few months later, Washington Mutual acquired the 41 office Coos Bay-based Western Bank in Oregon.[86] By 2007, Enterprise was merged into Western and operated as branch of Western.[155]
After Washington Mutual expanded into California through the acquisitions of American Savings, Great Western, and Home Savings, Washington Mutual quietly acquired the one-office Industrial Bank in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles an undisclosed amount in 1999[156][157] and renamed it WM Business Bank.[156]
By 2001, Washington Mutual had 38 specialized business banking centers operating under the Western Bank name in the Northwest and the WM Business Bank name in California when they decided to exit the commercial banking market that was then dominated with the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America.[87]
Mortgage banking[edit]
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Washington Mutual decided to aggressively expand in the subprime mortgage lending field through the acquisition of existing mortgage companies at a time when other financial institutions were leaving.
In May 1999, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Orange, California-based Long Beach Financial Corporation with its Long Beach Mortgage Company subsidiary for $350.4 million in cash and stock.[158][159] The acquisition by was completed in October 1999.[160] Long Beach had specialized in providing subprime mortgages. Some of Long Beach's questionable business practices may have led to Washington Mutual's failure in 2008.[161]
In January 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Los Angeles-based Alta Residential Mortgage Trust for $23 million.[162]
In October 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based PNC Mortgage Corporation and PNC Mortgage Securities Corporation from the PNC Financial Services Group for $605 million in cash.[163][164] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[165] The result of the PNC Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's third-largest lender.
In April 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Columbia, South Carolina-based Fleet Mortgage Corporation from FleetBoston Financial for $660 million in cash.[166] The acquisition by was completed in June 2001.[167] The result of the Fleet Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's second-largest mortgage-servicing business.
In December 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Jacksonville, Florida-based HomeSide Lending, Inc. from the National Australia Bank for $1.9 billion. The agreement did not include the mortgage servicing rights and related financial hedges for the business.[168][169] The acquisition by was completed in March 2002.[170] In August 2002, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the rest of HomeSide that included the mortgage servicing rights on a mortgage portfolio worth about $131 billion for $1.3 billion in cash and the assumption of $735 million in debt.[171] The acquisition by was completed in October 2002.[172]
In July 2002, the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Capital Corporation announced the pending sale of the mortgage loan portfolio for its Bay View Bank subsidiary to Washington Mutual for a "slight premium to book value".[173] The sale by was completed in the following month.[174]
In April 2006, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irvine, California-based Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. with its Commercial Capital Bank FSB subsidiary for $983 million in cash.[175][176] The acquisition by was completed in October 2006.[177] Commercial Capital had specialized in loans for the multifamily and small commercial real estate lending markets and was the third largest multifamily lender in California.
Rise and fall[edit]
"Wal-Mart of Banking"[edit]
Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger had pledged in 2003: "We hope to do to this industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe's, Home Depot did to their industry. And I think if we’ve done our job, five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank."[178]
Killinger's goal was to build WaMu into the "Wal-Mart of Banking", which would cater to lower- and middle-class consumers that other banks deemed too risky. Complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing, a strategy the bank extended in big cities, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. WaMu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets. WaMu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than $10,000 for bringing in borrowers. Variable-rate loans — Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (Option ARMs) in particular — were especially attractive, because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed WaMu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred. As WaMu was selling many of its loans to investors, it worried less about defaults.[9][178]
Subprime losses[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower (center right) in downtown Seattle was Washington Mutual's corporate headquarters from 1988 until 2006, when the company moved into the new WaMu Center (center left). These buildings have since been renamed; Washington Mutual Tower is now known as 1201 Third Avenue and WaMu Center is now known as Russell Investments Center.


In December 2007, the subsidiary Washington Mutual Bank reorganized its home-loan division, closing 160 of its 336 home-loan offices and removing 2,600 positions in its home-loan staff (a 22% reduction).[179]
In March 2008, on the same weekend that JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon negotiated the takeover of Bear Stearns, he secretly dispatched members of his team to Seattle to meet with WaMu executives, urging them to consider a quick deal. However, WaMu Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger rejected JPMorgan Chase's offer that valued WaMu at $8 a share, mostly in stock.[9][178]
In April 2008, the holding company, responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis, announced that 3,000 people companywide would lose their jobs, and the company stated its intent to close its approximately 176 remaining stand-alone, home-loan offices, including 23 in Washington and a loan-processing center in Bellevue, Washington. It stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as "wholesale lending." WaMu also announced a $7 billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by TPG Capital. TPG agreed to pump $2 billion into the Washington Mutual holding company; other investors, including some of WaMu's current institutional holders, agreed to buy an additional $5 billion in newly issued stock. This angered many investors, as TPG's investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, and as WaMu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses.[180]
In June 2008, Kerry Killinger stepped down as the Chairman, though remaining the Chief Executive Officer.[181] On September 8, 2008, under pressure from investors, the Washington Mutual holding company's board of directors dismissed Killinger as the CEO. Alan H. Fishman, chairman of mortgage broker Meridian Capital Group, and a former chief operating officer of Sovereign Bank, was named the new CEO for 17 days.[182]
Seizure by OTS and FDIC[edit]
By mid-September 2008, WaMu's share price had closed as low as $2.00. It had been worth over $30.00 in September 2007, and had briefly traded as high as $45 in the previous year.[183] While WaMu publicly insisted it could stay independent, earlier in the month it had quietly hired Goldman Sachs to identify potential bidders. However, several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid.[16] At the same time, WaMu suffered a massive run (mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfer[citation needed]); customers pulled out $16.7 billion in deposits in a ten-day span.[184]
This led the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to step up pressure for WaMu to find a buyer, as a takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could have been a severe drain on the FDIC insurance fund, which had already been hard hit by the failure of IndyMac that year. The FDIC ultimately held a secret auction of Washington Mutual Bank. Finally, on the morning of Thursday, September 25 (which happened to be the 119th anniversary of WaMu's establishment), regulators informed JPMorgan Chase that they were the winners.[16]
On Thursday night (shortly after the close of business on the West Coast), the Office of Thrift Supervision seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC. In a statement, the OTS said that the massive run meant that WaMu was no longer sound.[184] The FDIC, as receiver, sold most of Washington Mutual Bank's assets, including the branch network, to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. JPMorgan agreed to assume the bank's secured debts and liabilities to depositors. The transaction did not require any FDIC insurance funds.[185] Normally, bank seizures take place after the close of business on Fridays. However, due to the bank's deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent, regulators felt compelled to act a day early.[16]
Because JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual's assets for a low price, WaMu's stockholders were nearly wiped out. Its stock price dropped to $0.16 a share, far from $45 a share in 2007.[183] In its Chapter 11 filing, WaMu listed assets of $33 billion and debt of $8 billion. (ref. Appendix A). The filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors.
Within days of the seizure, a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist, Mike Stathis of AVA Investment Analytics, issued a formal complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, demonstrating evidence of insider trading. The complaint also alleged that Washington Mutual was not insolvent, and several Wall Street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock. He also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press who told him that he was contacted by a Washington Mutual executive hours before the seizure, telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons.” In later criticisms, Stathis discussed that neither the FDIC nor OTS ever disclosed any evidence of Washington Mutual's insolvency.[186] Stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint, he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning. As a result of this, Stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the SEC complaint into the public domain until a year later.[187][188]
Shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of Washington Mutual through such websites as WaMuCoup.com (dead link) and others, claiming that the OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of JPMorgan Chase, which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price. Shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover, the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the OTS 2 weeks earlier[189] and that the holding company's board and management was kept completely in the dark about the government's negotiations with Chase, hampering the bank's ability to sell itself on its own. Chief executive Alan H. Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed, and eventually received a $7.5 million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6 million (which he declined) after being CEO for 17 days.[190] Senator Maria Cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation[191] and Washington Mutual's former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares.[189]
The seizure of WaMu Bank resulted in the largest bank failure in American financial history, far exceeding the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984.[16][192][193]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc., and its remaining subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[194] Washington Mutual, Inc., was promptly delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and commenced trading via Pink Sheets. The bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks, after the Lehman Brothers filing eleven days earlier; both bankruptcies far outpaced WorldCom's 2002 filing, which had held the record with just under $104 billion in assets (Washington Mutual's alone, which was approximately half that of Lehman Brothers, was three times as much as WorldCom's).
All assets but only some liabilities (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank were assumed by JPMorgan Chase.[195] Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase acquired all the banking operations of WaMu, including $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits, for a price of $1.9 billion plus debt assumptions.[196] Unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the FDIC, leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery.[195] On Friday, Sep. 26, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank customers were informed that Deposits held by Washington Mutual became now liabilities of JPMorgan Chase.[197]
The IRS claimed $12.5 billion in back taxes from Washington Mutual, Inc.. The company filed court papers on January 22, 2009 alleging losses were $20 billion, and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt, stating that the IRS could owe Washington Mutual Inc. a tax refund.[198] In a settlement between Wash. Mutual Inc. (in receivership), the FDIC, and JPMorgan Chase that Wash. Mutual Inc. recently made public, a tax refund of about US$5.7 billion will be shared between Wash. Mutual Inc., JPMorgan Chase and FDIC.[199]
Washington Mutual, Inc., sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for US$13 billion after the sale of its banking operations to JPMorgan Chase.[200] WMI attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank, and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken.
On January 11, 2010, the United States Department of Justice, Office of the United States Trustee, District of Delaware, pursuant to Section 1102(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, appointed a Committee of Equity Security Holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock. All of the Motions to Disband the Committee of Equity Security Holders were denied on January 28, 2010 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath, District of Delaware.[201][202]
On July 20, 2010, bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath approved a motion of the EC for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of WMI, handing a victory to shareholders. The Judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase at the heart of WaMu's reorganization, but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company.[203]
On July 26, 2010, U.S. Trustee Roberta A. DeAngelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP partner Joshua R. Hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC. Hochberg is a partner in McKenna Long & Aldridge's Washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense, internal investigations and compliance.[204]
On August 10, 2010, the bankruptcy judge rejected Washington Mutual Inc.'s effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting. Attorneys for the EC said that WMI was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information. The judge agreed that WMI was not entitled to the information.[205]
On November 1, 2010, examiner Joshua R. Hochberg from McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP presented his long-awaited report, but it did not meet the expectations of the court, since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorney-client work. On December 12, the court decided to exclude the examiner's report during the plan confirmation hearings, saying it can't be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions.[206]
On January 7, 2011, the bankruptcy court rejected the 6th proposed plan of reorganization, which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Judge Mary Walrath focused many of her criticisms on the company's releases of liability granted to directors, officers and others including some hedge funds, who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement. She noted for example that shareholders, who will likely get nothing, should not have to release the company's board from the threat of being sued by them.[207] However, many WaMu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when Washington Mutual emerges from bankruptcy.
On September 14, 2011, the court also rejected the modified 6th proposed plan of reorganization. Judge Mary F. Walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt. The four hedge funds are Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management.[208]
A seventh plan of reorganization was announced in February 2012[209][210] and the company finally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month as WMI Holdings Corporation.[211] By 2015, WMI Holdings was able to raise $598 million and was looking for new acquisitions.[212]
Post receivership bank operations[edit]
During 2009, all of the Washington Mutual Bank branches that had been purchased from the FDIC after the bank had been placed into receivership, were rebranded to Chase or shuttered. All financial documents issued by WaMu were changed to carry the JPMorgan Chase logo. Credit and debit cards issued by WaMu or Providian were changed to carry the Chase logo.
Since 2009, Chase ATMs have been accessible for WaMu customers at no extra charge, and the branches and accounts were formally merged in 2009 as the WaMu brand was retired.[16] Branches in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Utah were rebranded in May 2009; branches in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Greater New York were rebranded in July 2009, and the remaining branches in Nevada, California, Arizona, and Colorado were rebranded in October 2009.[213][214] The last rebrandings formally retired the WaMu name.
In markets where Chase already had a dominant presence, such as Greater New York and Chicago owing to the presence of Chase and predecessor Bank One (in New York, the merger resulted in different branches on the same block), Chase further disposed of such branches to other banks.[215]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
"Free Checking Account"[edit]
This advertising campaign was introduced between 2005 and 2007. Numerous WaMu commercials showed traditionally-dressed 60-70-year-old overweight bankers laughing out loud at a WaMu representative (who is much younger and fitter), who says the words "Free Checking Account".
"The Power of Yes"[edit]
WaMu introduced an advertising campaign during the 2003 Academy Awards known as “The Power of Yes”. This was to promote the offering of loans to all consumers, particularly borrowers that the banks deemed too risky. Another commercial in the ad series showed WaMu representatives in casual clothes, contrasting with traditionally-dressed bankers in suits.
"Whoo hoo"[edit]




A promotional Washington Mutual "Whoo hoo!" bumper sticker.


"Whoo hoo!" was an advertising campaign introduced by Washington Mutual in February 2008. As fears of an economic crisis were rising, and WaMu was looking to become an "iconic brand that people love", they began courting consumers with a new slogan, designed to position WaMu as a consumer-friendly institution.[216]
During its run, the Whoo hoo! ads, created by TBWA\Chiat\Day of Playa del Rey, California,[216] become widespread in web navigation.[217] After WaMu launched the new advertisement, there was double digit growth at its website[217] and the term “wamu” appeared in searches over 1,000% more between January and March than in all of 2007.[217]
Washington Mutual (before the bank's September 2008 conservatorship and sale to JPMorgan Chase) applied to register a trademark in the phrase.[218][219] Initially, the bank wanted to use "woo hoo" (without the "h" in the first word) as the slogan, but they were concerned because of the existing use of the phrase by Homer Simpson, a character in The Simpsons.[218]
Occasio branch design[edit]
Washington Mutual introduced a unique branch design known as Occasio which eliminated traditional teller windows and queuing stanchions in favor of an open, circular floor plan with a greeter or "concierge" position and tellers working from behind podiums.[220][221] The Occasio design was introduced in 2000 and patented in 2004,[222] but was phased out following the JPMorgan Chase acquisition of Washington Mutual's retail banking operations.[223]

After the merger, Washington Mutual Financial Group will have 76 branches, which can be used by customers of Washington Mutual Savings Bank and Columbia Federal. Washington Mutual's assets will increase to $6.2 billion from $5.5 billion. The Seattle-based savings bank paid about $39 million, or $17.53 a share, for Columbia Federal, and $7.5 million, or $5 a share, for Shoreline.

In one of the Pacific Northwest's biggest financial transactions of its kind, Washington Mutual Savings Bank said today it won the sweepstakes to take control of Pacific First Financial Corp., parent company to Pacific First Bank. The move will make Washington Mutual the second-largest financial institution in Washington and give it a huge initial presence in Oregon. Washington Mutual said it will pay $663 million for the rival institution - both have Seattle headquarters. After the deal is done next May or June, Washington Mutual will be second in size here only to Seafirst Bank. Just three years ago, then publicly held Pacific First was acquired by Royal Trustco of Toronto, Canada, for $212 million. But since then, Royal Trustco has run into problems elsewhere, and decided to abandon its strategy to string branches along the West Coast of the United States. It put Pacific First up for bid.

^ a b c Virgin, Bill (October 28, 1992). "Washington Mutual Plans to Buy Pacific First Bank". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. p. B5. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Savings Bank will buy Pacific First Bank in a deal that cements its position as one of the three leading financial institutions in the Pacific Northwest. It also brings to a somewhat messy and expensive end a foray into the American banking market by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, parent of Pacific First. While Royal Trustco is giving up its dream of building an American banking empire anchored in Seattle, it will be stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate loans that are in default or heading that way. And the $663 million acquisition of Pacific First Financial Corp. marks the third major upheaval of banking in Washington in a year, which will mean more sign changes, building closures and potential layoffs for employees. Washington Mutual already has $8.4 billion in assets and 118 branches and 17 loan centers in Washington and Oregon. Pacific First has assets of $6.9 billion, 127 branches in Washington, Oregon and California and eight mortgage offices. It previously agreed to trade its 10 California branches for Great Western Bank's 14 Washington branches. Once the Pacific First deal is completed, Washington Mutual will have assets of about $14 billion... Pacific First is merely the latest in a series of acquisitions Washington Mutual has made in the last few years, including Pioneer Savings in Lynnwood, Great Northwest in Bremerton and VanFed in Vancouver. With Pacific First's branches, Washington Mutual's share of consumer deposits in Washington will be 17.2 percent, ahead of KeyCorp-Puget Sound with 10.3 percent and trailing only Seafirst at 20.4 percent, Tejera said. In Oregon, Washington Mutual will become the fourth biggest in consumer deposits.

^ MacKenzie, Bill (February 22, 1991). "Pacific First Tops Oregon Thrifts". The Oregonian. p. E15. (Subscription required (help)). Pacific First Bank, a Seattle-based thrift, has quietly become the largest holder of deposits among all thrifts operating in Oregon. It also operates 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift. Its rise has been due, in part, to turmoil in the thrift industry that has led to deposit declines at competitors and the shift of one large thrift to a bank. Pacific First had $1.1 billion in deposits at its Oregon branches at the end of 1989. A year later, deposits had grown to $2.3 billion. It now holds about 27 percent of the thrift market in Oregon and about 9 percent of the combined thrift and bank market. The next-largest Oregon thrift is Far West Federal Bank with $1.3 billion in deposits... Pacific First has been serving Oregonians since 1936, but it had only a few branches until December 1988, when it bought 17 branches of Salem-based American Home Savings. One year later the thrift was acquired by Toronto, Canada-based Royal Trustco, Canada's largest trust company, which injected $100 million of capital into the thrift and set it on an aggressive expansion course. Pacific First acquired the 45 branches of Willamette Savings and Loan in June and added the 12 Oregon branches of the Williamsburg Federal Savings and Loan Association in September. Some recently acquired branches have been closed, leaving the thrift with 78 Oregon branches spread throughout the state, but principally in the Portland metropolitan area and the Willamette Valley.

Washington Mutual is already the leading residential real estate lender in Oregon. But the deal also increases Washington Mutual's reach into the commercial banking market. Washington Mutual has traditionally emphasized the thrift business, which means home mortgage and consumer loans. Western, being a commercial bank, focuses on lending to small- and medium-sized businesses. Commercial banking is a business Washington Mutual has been increasingly interested in.

Washington Mutual Inc., a Seattle financial services firm, said Monday it will buy American Savings Bank and its parent company in a stock for stock transaction worth $3.5 billion. Irvine-based American Savings Bank will keep its name, and officials said they expect all branches to remain open, officials said... Washington Mutual, which owns a network of banks, is the No. 1 residential mortgage originator in Washington and Oregon. American Savings is California's second largest home-mortgage originator. The deal gives Washington Mutual its first presence in California, allowing an immediate foothold in key locations that will solidify its West Coast position... Robert M. Bass and his investor group control Keystone Holdings Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, the parent company of American Savings. After the acquisition, Keystone will be merged into Washington Mutual. The investor group will get 26 million of the 48 million shares to be issued by Washington Mutual in the merger. With total outstanding shares of 117.5 million, the group's share amounts to a 22 percent ownership in the new company, with Bass holding an 8 percent stake. About 14 million of the new shares will go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will sell them after the merger. The rest will be held in escrow pending the outcome of a Keystone lawsuit against the federal government. Washington Mutual also will assume Keystone's $365 million of debt and $80 million in outstanding preferred stock. Mario Antoci, American Savings' chairman and CEO, will retire after the deal closes. Post-merger management changes have not been finalized. Antoci took over American Savings in 1988, when the Bass Group bought it. American Savings Bank was originally part of American Savings and Loan, a failed thrift that led to the largest savings and loan bailout in history. The original thrift was divided into two parts: American Savings Bank controlled the profitable assets and loans while the other unit was liquidated. American Savings Bank has 220 branches in California and Arizona. Washington Mutual has 317 branches in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana. 
^ Fuquay, Jim (July 23, 1996). "Bass group bonanza - Keystone Holdings sells a California thrift in a deal valued at $1.6 billion.". Fort Worth Star-Telegram. p. 1. (Subscription required (help)). An investment group led by Fort Worth billionaire Robert M. Bass cashed in on a $400 million investment in California's American Savings yesterday, selling the thrift it acquired less than eight years ago. The deal was valued at more than $1.6 billion. Washington Mutual Inc., the parent of one of Washington state's largest savings banks, agreed to acquire the thrift for at least 40 million shares of Washington Mutual stock. That stock was worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at Friday's closing price. Washington Mutual will also assume $465 million in debt as part of the deal... Bass made his investment through Keystone Holdings, in which he owns about 36 percent. In 1988, Keystone acquired American Savings from the federal government, which had seized the thrift in 1984. Keystone invested $350 million in cash into American Savings and spent another $50 million in expenses to buy the institution, which at the time was America's biggest insolvent thrift. Keystone installed Mario J. Antoci, a respected thrift executive, to run American Savings. The thrift, stripped of its most troubled assets, immediately started making money... The Keystone group will also name two members of Washington Mutual's 13-person board, suggesting that the group is likely to retain its interest in the company.

Hoping to marry the nation's two largest savings and loans into a financial powerhouse, the corporate parent of Home Savings of America has offered to buy Great Western Financial Corp. in a deal valued at nearly $6 billion, sources close to the proposed transaction said late Monday. The unsolicited offer by Irwindale-based H.F. Ahmanson & Co. would form the third-largest financial institution in California--after giant Bank of America and Wells Fargo. It would also result in the closure of more than 100 bank branches and the probable loss of hundreds of jobs, sources said.

Great Western Financial Corp. sought to buy time to fend off H.F. Ahmanson and Co.'s $6.2 billion takeover bid yesterday as its bankers met with potential rival suitors, sources close to Great Western said... Sources said possible bidders that Great Western may have contacted include First Bank System Inc., Washington Mutual Savings Bank and Norwest Corp. Local banking executives and analysts said Washington Mutual is likely to take a close look at a deal for Great Western, and said there are equally strong reasons why the Seattle-based thrift might bid or walk away. On the negative side, Washington Mutual is currently digesting a major California acquisition, a hurry-up deal wouldn't give it time to carefully review the transaction, it wouldn't get the same cost savings Ahmanson would to make the deal attractive, and a bidding war could become expensive.

With the combination, Seattle-based Washington Mutual creates one of the biggest thrifts in the West, with $88.5 billion in assets, $52.5 billion in deposits and more than 1,150 branches in Washington, Oregon, California and Florida. The acquisition of Great Western, the second-largest U.S. thrift, also bolsters Washington Mutual's reputation as one of the most aggressive acquirers in the industry. Washington Mutual has completed 22 acquisitions and multiplied its assets more than twentyfold in 14 years.

Seattle-based Washington Mutual will acquire Bank United Corp., the largest publicly traded Texas-based financial institution. Texas was something of an incidental market Washington Mutual picked up in its 1998 acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson & Co.; while the real prize in the Ahmanson deal was its huge share of the market in California, it also had 48 branches in Texas, primarily in Houston and Dallas... Bank United will provide that, with 155 branches, including 66 in Houston, 77 in Dallas-Fort Worth and a handful in Midland, Austin and San Antonio.

Bank United, the largest financial institution based in Texas, said yesterday that it agreed to be acquired by Washington Mutual, the nation's biggest savings and loan. The deal, valued at $1.5 billion and expected to close by year's end, will greatly increase Washington Mutual's presence in the state. The Seattle-based institution entered Texas in 1998 with its acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson & Co., parent of Savings of America, and the Bank United merger will give it 3 percent of Texas deposits, according to June 30, 1999, reports, the latest available. Washington Mutual, which ranks No. 8 among all U.S. banks and thrifts, also has a previous Texas connection. In 1995, it acquired American Savings, a California thrift owned by Fort Worth investor Robert M. Bass, who became a major Washington Mutual shareholder as a result of that deal. A Bass lieutenant, Jay Crandall, remains on Washington Mutual's board of directors... Bank United has 155 retail branches in the state, including 77 in North Texas, along with 42 commercial loan offices and 11 other sales offices. Washington Mutual has 48 branches in Texas, including two in Tarrant County... About a dozen Texas branches share overlapping market areas, the companies said. That includes downtown Fort Worth, where two branches are within blocks of each other.

Washington Mutual, Inc., abbreviated to WaMu, was a savings bank holding company and the former owner of Washington Mutual Bank, which was the United States' largest savings and loan association until its collapse in 2008.[5][6][7][8][9]
On Thursday, September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) seized Washington Mutual Bank from Washington Mutual, Inc. and placed it into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The OTS took the action due to the withdrawal of $16.7 billion in deposits during a 9-day bank run (amounting to 9% of the deposits it had held on June 30, 2008).[10] The FDIC sold the banking subsidiaries (minus unsecured debt and equity claims) to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion, which JPMorgan Chase had been planning to acquire as part of a confidential plan internally nicknamed Project West.[11][12][13] All WaMu branches were rebranded as Chase branches by the end of 2009. The holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc., was left with $33 billion in assets, and $8 billion debt, after being stripped of its banking subsidiary by the FDIC.[6][7][14][15] The next day, September 26, Washington Mutual, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 voluntary bankruptcy in Delaware, where it was incorporated.[7][14]
With respect to total assets under management, Washington Mutual Bank's closure and receivership is the largest bank failure in American financial history.[6][7] Before the receivership action, it was the sixth-largest bank in the United States.[16] According to Washington Mutual Inc.'s 2007 SEC filing, the holding company held assets valued at $327.9 billion.[17]
On March 20, 2009, Washington Mutual Inc. filed suit against the FDIC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking damages of approximately $13 billion for what it claims was an unjustified seizure and an extremely low sale price to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase promptly filed a counterclaim in the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, where the Washington Mutual bankruptcy proceedings had been continuing since the Office of Thrift Supervision's seizure of the holding company's bank subsidiaries.[18][19]

Business operations prior to bank receivership[edit]




A former WaMu branch in the Chinatown section of New York City (2004)


Despite its name, Washington Mutual ceased being a mutual company in 1983 when it demutualized and became a public company on March 11.
On June 30, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank had total assets of US$307 billion, with 2,239 retail branch offices operating in 15 states, with 4,932 ATMs, and 43,198 employees. It held liabilities in the form of deposits of $188.3 billion, and owed $82.9 billion to the Federal Home Loan Bank, and had subordinated debt of $7.8 billion. It held as assets of $118.9 billion in single-family loans, of which $52.9 billion were "option adjustable rate mortgages" (Option ARMs), with $16 billion in subprime mortgage loans, and $53.4 billion of Home Equity lines of Credit (HELOCs) and credit cards receivables of $10.6 billion. It was servicing for itself and other banks loans totaling $689.7 billion, of which $442.7 were for other banks. It had non-performing assets of $11.6 billion, including $3.23 billion in payment option ARMs and $3.0 billion in subprime mortgage loans.[20]
On September 15, 2008, the holding company received a credit rating agency downgrade. From that date through September 24, 2008, WaMu experienced a bank run whereby customers withdrew $16.7 billion in deposits over those 9 days,[15] and in excess of $22 billion in cash outflow since July 2008, both conditions which ultimately led the Office of Thrift Supervision to close the bank.[20]
The FDIC then sold most of the bank's assets to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion in cash plus assumption of all secured debt and some unsecured debt. Claims of the subsidiary bank's equity holders, senior and subordinated debt (all primarily owned by the holding company) were not assumed by JPMorgan Chase[clarification needed].[7][21][22]
History[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower at 1201 Third Avenue in Seattle, Washington


Mutual savings bank[edit]
Washington Mutual was incorporated as the Washington National Building Loan and Investment Association on September 25, 1889, after the Great Seattle Fire destroyed 120 acres (49 ha) of the central business district of Seattle. The newly formed company made its first home mortgage loan on the West Coast on February 10, 1890. It changed its name to Washington Savings and Loan Association on June 25, 1908.[2] By September 12, 1917 it was operating under the name Washington Mutual Savings Bank.[23] The company purchased its first company, the financially distressed Continental Mutual Savings Bank, on July 25, 1930.[2] Its marketing slogan for much of its history was "The Friend of the Family".
Post demutualization growth[edit]
In April 1982, Washington Mutual purchased the brokerage firm Murphey Favre for undisclosed amount in cash[24] and demutualized the following year, converting into a capital stock savings bank.[25] Stock in the capital stock savings bank was first offered for sale on March 11, 1983.[26] By 1989, its assets had doubled.[2]
In November 1994, Washington Mutual formed a new holding called Washington Mutual, Inc. and separated its non-banking units from its primary banking unit, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, which was simultaneously renamed Washington Mutual Bank.[27][28][29] The company's stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under WAMU.
In October 2005, Washington Mutual purchased the formerly "subprime" credit card issuer Providian for approximately $6.5 billion, although Providian's new management team's strategy of targeting Prime credit card consumers had been underway since 2001, therefore the credit card unit's nonperforming loan portfolio had improved significantly prior to the company's sale to WaMu. In March 2006, Washington Mutual began the move into its new headquarters, WaMu Center, located in downtown Seattle. The company's previous headquarters, Washington Mutual Tower, stands about a block away from the new building on Second Avenue. In August 2006, Washington Mutual began using the official abbreviation of WaMu in all but legal situations.
Acquisitions[edit]

After the acquisition of Murphey Favre, WaMu made numerous acquisitions with the aim of expanding the corporation. By acquiring companies including PNC Mortgage, Fleet Mortgage and Homeside Lending, WaMu became the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. With the acquisition of Providian Financial Corporation in October 2005, WaMu became the nation's 9th-largest credit-card company.
A partial list of Washington Mutual acquisitions since demutualization:[30]

Commercial Capital Bancorp, California, 2006
Providian Financial Corporation, California, 2005
HomeSide Lending, Inc., Florida, a unit of National Australia Bank, 2002
Fleet Mortgage Corp., South Carolina, 2001
PNC Mortgage, Illinois, 2001
Alta Residential Mortgage Trust, California, 2000
Long Beach Financial Corp., California, 1999


Many of Washington Mutual's acquisitions became reviled as the rapid post-merger integrations resulted in numerous errors. The purchase of the original PNC Mortgage came at a time when subprime lending was in a "boom" period, with PNC Financial Services believing that the market was too volatile.[31] (PNC later re-entered the mortgage market in 2009 through its acquisition of National City Corp., with no plans to re-enter subprime lending.) The Dime merger resulted in account ownership to be split with account beneficiaries. The Fleet Mortgage merger resulted in entire loans simply disappearing — being serviced, but unable to be found by customer service representatives.[citation needed]
Expansion in Washington[edit]
In April 1983, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of three branch offices from the Tacoma-based United Mutual Savings Bank for $3.25 million.[32]

In January 1990, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of all seven offices of the Seattle-based Old Stone Bank of Washington from the Rhode Island-based Old Stone Corporation for an undisclosed amount.[39][40][41] Old Stone originally entered the state of Washington through the acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association in 1985 with the assistance of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.[42][43][44] The acquisition by Washington Mutual was completed in June 1990 for $10 million.[45][46]

In August 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Seattle-based Sound Savings and Loan Association for an undisclosed amount.[53] At the time of the announcement in August 1991, Washington Mutual had 84 branch offices, all within Washington state.[53] The acquisition by was completed in January 1992.[54]

In December 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of both Washington state branch offices of the California-based World Savings and Loan Association of America, a subsidiary of Golden West Financial, for an undisclosed amount.[58] The acquisition by was completed in March 1992.[59]
In August 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Lynnwood-based Pioneer Savings Bank for $181 million in stock.[60][61][62] The acquisition by was completed in March 1993.[63]
 In October 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Pacific First Financial Corporation with its Pacific First Bank subsidiary for $663 million from its Canada-based parent Royal Trustco. The acquisition was contingent on having Pacific First dispose of its branch offices in California and having its Canadian parent Royal Trustco assume all of Pacific First's bad loans.[64][65][66] The acquisition by was completed in April 1993.[67] At the time of the initial announcement in October 1992, Washington Mutual had 118 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Pacific First had 127 branch offices in Washington, Oregon and California. Pacific First had previously announced that it was trading its California offices for Great Western's Washington offices. As a result of the Pacific First acquisition, Washington Mutual became one of the largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits in the state of Washington, second only to Seafirst.[66]
In June 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Summit Bancorp with its Summit Savings Bank subsidiary for $25 million in stock.[68] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 231 branch offices in Washington and Oregon. The acquisition by was completed in November 1994.[69]
In June 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank for $26.8 million in stock.[70][71][72] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 260 branch offices. Unlike the previous acquisition targets, Enterprise held a commercial bank charter and not a thrift charter.
Expansion in Oregon[edit]
In April 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the 25 offices in the Portland, Oregon / Vancouver, Washington area from the ailing New York-based CrossLand Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Brooklyn Bancorp, for an undisclosed amount.[73] The acquisition by was completed in November 1991.[52] Seven of the 25 offices were located in Washington with the remainder in Oregon. As part of the transaction, CrossLand Savings closed seven offices in Oregon and three offices in Washington, leaving eleven offices in Oregon and four in Washington.[52] CrossLand had previously entered Oregon (and three other states) through the relatively recent acquisition of the troubled Utah-based Western Savings and Loan Association.[74][75][76] The CrossLand acquisition gave Washington Mutual a toe hold entry into Oregon via Portland.
As a result of the Pacific First acquisition in April 1993, Washington Mutual became the fourth largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits within the state of Oregon.[66] Originally, Pacific First grew quickly in Oregon during the late 1980s through the acquisition of troubled savings and loans.[77][78] By February 1991, Pacific First had 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift.[79] Pacific First had 71 branches in Oregon by July 1992.[80]
In April 1994, Washington Mutual announced the completed acquisition of three Portland-area offices of the failed Portland-based Far West Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $2.2 million.[81]
In October 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Coos Bay-based Western Bank for $156 million in stock.[82][83][84][85] The acquisition by was completed in February 1996.[86] Since Western Bank possessed a commercial bank charter and not a more restrictive savings & loan charter, Washington Mutual decided to allow Western Bank to keep its charter and name and to remain semi-autonomous for a while. At the time of the acquisition, Western Bank had 41 offices throughout Oregon. Five years later, Washington Mutual decided to abandon the Western Bank brand and integrate most of the former Western Bank offices into the existing Washington Mutual network in Oregon in 2001.[87][88] Due to branch overlaps between the two brands, 12 Western Bank branch offices and one Washington Mutual branch office were sold to the Klamath Falls-based Klamath First Bancorp for $33 million.[89][90]
Expansion in Idaho[edit]
In March 1994, Washington Mutual announced that they were planning to expand into the state of Idaho by building new branch offices inside Fred Meyer supermarket stores with the first three being opened in the Boise-area in July and August.[91][92][93][94]
In the following year, Washington Mutual opened a fourth Idaho location in a Moscow supermarket in February 1995.[95]
A branch office in Idaho Falls was acquired from the Utah-based United Savings Bank when Washington Mutual purchased the savings bank in January 1997.[96]
By March 2000, there were 9 locations within Idaho[97] and later 22 locations in 2008 when Chase acquired Washington Mutual.[98]
Expansion in Utah[edit]
In July 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank, FSB, subsidiary for $52.1 million in stock.[99][100] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 250 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Olympus had eight branch offices in Utah and two in Montana. The acquisition by was completed in May 1995.[101]
In March 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Ogden-based Utah Federal Savings Bank for an undisclosed amount.[102][103] At the time of the announcement, Utah Federal had five branch offices while Washington Mutual had 16 within Utah. The acquisition by was completed in December 1996 for $15.2 million.[104]
In September 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based United Western Financial Group Inc. with its United Savings Bank subsidiary for $80.3 million in cash.[105][106][107][108] At the time of the announcement, United Savings Bank had eight branch offices in Utah and one in Idaho. The acquisition by was completed in January 1997.[96]
Expansion in Montana[edit]
In May 1995, Washington Mutual acquired two branch offices in Butte as the result of the acquisition of the Utah-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank FSB subsidiary. Four years later, Washington Mutual later sold the two offices to Glacier Bancorp in 1999 for an undisclosed amount and quietly left the state of Montana.[109][110]
Expansion in California[edit]
 In July 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Fort Worth, Texas-based Keystone Holdings Inc. with its Irvine-based American Savings Bank subsidiary for $1.6 billion in stock.[111][112][113][114][115][116] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 317 branch offices in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana while American Savings Bank had 220 branch offices in California.[115] The acquisition by was completed in December 1996.[117][118][119][120] American kept its name after the acquisition. The result of the acquisition nearly doubled the total deposits of all Washington Mutual subsidiaries from $22 billion to $42 billion.
In February 1997, the Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial, the holding company for second largest thrift in the nation Great Western Bank, found itself the target of a hostile takeover attempt of arch-rival H. F. Ahmanson & Co., the holding company for the largest thrift in the nation Home Savings of America, that would have involved $5.8 billion worth of stock. Since the two companies had large overlapping territories, many Great Western offices would have been closed by the victor if the takeover attempt had succeeded.[121][122][123] The only way the combat a hostile takeover was to find another company, called a white knight that would allow a merger on much better terms. One such company was Washington Mutual. In March, Great Western Financial announced that it had accepted Washington Mutual's merger proposal for $6.6 billion in Washington Mutual stock.[124][125][126] Ahmanson quickly increased their bids[127] but the bids were also rejected.[128] Great Western approved the merger with Washington Mutual in June[129] and the merger was completed in July.[130][131] As part of its merger agreement, it was originally announced that Great Western offices would be allowed to keep the Great Western name and there were later discussion of converting the American Savings offices to the Great Western brand. In the end, it was felt that it was best for the company to have only one brand throughout the nation instead of multiple regional brands so it was announce in December 1997 that both Great Western and American names would be retired in favor of the Washington Mutual name.[132] The previous month, it was announced in November that 85 redundant branch offices were identified in California and were to be closed within the following year.[133][134] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 413 branch operating under various names across the country while Great Western had 416 branch offices operating in California and Florida.[135]
In March 1998, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irwindale-based H. F. Ahmanson & Company with its Home Savings of America subsidiary for approximately $10 billion in stock.[136][137][138] The acquisition by was completed in October 1998 for only $6.9 billion in stock.[139] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 892 branch operating under various names (Washington Mutual, American Savings, Great Western, etc.) across the country while Home Savings had 409 branch offices operating in California and Texas.[140][141] A few days after the completion of the merger, Washington Mutual announces plans to close 161 branch offices in California.[142][143]
Expansion in Texas[edit]
Through the 1998 acquisition of Home Savings, Washington Mutual had gained 48 branch offices in Texas.
In August 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Houston-based Bank United Corporation with its 155 branch offices, all located in Texas, for $1.49 billion in stock.[144][145][146] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[147][148]
As a result of branch overlap between Bank United and Washington Mutual, 17 branch offices were closed in Texas, 10 of which were in Houston.[149] [150]
Expansion in New York[edit]
In June 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the New York City-based Dime Bancorp with its Dime Savings Bank subsidiary for $5.2 billion in cash and stock.[151][152] The acquisition by was completed in January 2002.[153] Dime had 123 branch offices in the New York City area of both New York and New Jersey.[154]
Commercial banking[edit]
With a thrift charter, there were a few things that Washington Mutual was not able to do until it was able to obtain a commercial bank charter, such as making commercial loans above a certain size. To get around this problem, Washington Mutual began to purchase commercial banks and maintain them as separate business entities. In August 1995, Washington Mutual acquired the one office Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank in Washington. A few months later, Washington Mutual acquired the 41 office Coos Bay-based Western Bank in Oregon.[86] By 2007, Enterprise was merged into Western and operated as branch of Western.[155]
After Washington Mutual expanded into California through the acquisitions of American Savings, Great Western, and Home Savings, Washington Mutual quietly acquired the one-office Industrial Bank in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles an undisclosed amount in 1999[156][157] and renamed it WM Business Bank.[156]
By 2001, Washington Mutual had 38 specialized business banking centers operating under the Western Bank name in the Northwest and the WM Business Bank name in California when they decided to exit the commercial banking market that was then dominated with the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America.[87]
Mortgage banking[edit]
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Washington Mutual decided to aggressively expand in the subprime mortgage lending field through the acquisition of existing mortgage companies at a time when other financial institutions were leaving.
In May 1999, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Orange, California-based Long Beach Financial Corporation with its Long Beach Mortgage Company subsidiary for $350.4 million in cash and stock.[158][159] The acquisition by was completed in October 1999.[160] Long Beach had specialized in providing subprime mortgages. Some of Long Beach's questionable business practices may have led to Washington Mutual's failure in 2008.[161]
In January 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Los Angeles-based Alta Residential Mortgage Trust for $23 million.[162]
In October 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based PNC Mortgage Corporation and PNC Mortgage Securities Corporation from the PNC Financial Services Group for $605 million in cash.[163][164] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[165] The result of the PNC Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's third-largest lender.
In April 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Columbia, South Carolina-based Fleet Mortgage Corporation from FleetBoston Financial for $660 million in cash.[166] The acquisition by was completed in June 2001.[167] The result of the Fleet Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's second-largest mortgage-servicing business.
In December 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Jacksonville, Florida-based HomeSide Lending, Inc. from the National Australia Bank for $1.9 billion. The agreement did not include the mortgage servicing rights and related financial hedges for the business.[168][169] The acquisition by was completed in March 2002.[170] In August 2002, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the rest of HomeSide that included the mortgage servicing rights on a mortgage portfolio worth about $131 billion for $1.3 billion in cash and the assumption of $735 million in debt.[171] The acquisition by was completed in October 2002.[172]
In July 2002, the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Capital Corporation announced the pending sale of the mortgage loan portfolio for its Bay View Bank subsidiary to Washington Mutual for a "slight premium to book value".[173] The sale by was completed in the following month.[174]
In April 2006, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irvine, California-based Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. with its Commercial Capital Bank FSB subsidiary for $983 million in cash.[175][176] The acquisition by was completed in October 2006.[177] Commercial Capital had specialized in loans for the multifamily and small commercial real estate lending markets and was the third largest multifamily lender in California.
Rise and fall[edit]
"Wal-Mart of Banking"[edit]
Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger had pledged in 2003: "We hope to do to this industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe's, Home Depot did to their industry. And I think if we’ve done our job, five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank."[178]
Killinger's goal was to build WaMu into the "Wal-Mart of Banking", which would cater to lower- and middle-class consumers that other banks deemed too risky. Complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing, a strategy the bank extended in big cities, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. WaMu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets. WaMu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than $10,000 for bringing in borrowers. Variable-rate loans — Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (Option ARMs) in particular — were especially attractive, because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed WaMu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred. As WaMu was selling many of its loans to investors, it worried less about defaults.[9][178]
Subprime losses[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower (center right) in downtown Seattle was Washington Mutual's corporate headquarters from 1988 until 2006, when the company moved into the new WaMu Center (center left). These buildings have since been renamed; Washington Mutual Tower is now known as 1201 Third Avenue and WaMu Center is now known as Russell Investments Center.


In December 2007, the subsidiary Washington Mutual Bank reorganized its home-loan division, closing 160 of its 336 home-loan offices and removing 2,600 positions in its home-loan staff (a 22% reduction).[179]
In March 2008, on the same weekend that JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon negotiated the takeover of Bear Stearns, he secretly dispatched members of his team to Seattle to meet with WaMu executives, urging them to consider a quick deal. However, WaMu Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger rejected JPMorgan Chase's offer that valued WaMu at $8 a share, mostly in stock.[9][178]
In April 2008, the holding company, responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis, announced that 3,000 people companywide would lose their jobs, and the company stated its intent to close its approximately 176 remaining stand-alone, home-loan offices, including 23 in Washington and a loan-processing center in Bellevue, Washington. It stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as "wholesale lending." WaMu also announced a $7 billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by TPG Capital. TPG agreed to pump $2 billion into the Washington Mutual holding company; other investors, including some of WaMu's current institutional holders, agreed to buy an additional $5 billion in newly issued stock. This angered many investors, as TPG's investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, and as WaMu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses.[180]
In June 2008, Kerry Killinger stepped down as the Chairman, though remaining the Chief Executive Officer.[181] On September 8, 2008, under pressure from investors, the Washington Mutual holding company's board of directors dismissed Killinger as the CEO. Alan H. Fishman, chairman of mortgage broker Meridian Capital Group, and a former chief operating officer of Sovereign Bank, was named the new CEO for 17 days.[182]
Seizure by OTS and FDIC[edit]
By mid-September 2008, WaMu's share price had closed as low as $2.00. It had been worth over $30.00 in September 2007, and had briefly traded as high as $45 in the previous year.[183] While WaMu publicly insisted it could stay independent, earlier in the month it had quietly hired Goldman Sachs to identify potential bidders. However, several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid.[16] At the same time, WaMu suffered a massive run (mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfer[citation needed]); customers pulled out $16.7 billion in deposits in a ten-day span.[184]
This led the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to step up pressure for WaMu to find a buyer, as a takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could have been a severe drain on the FDIC insurance fund, which had already been hard hit by the failure of IndyMac that year. The FDIC ultimately held a secret auction of Washington Mutual Bank. Finally, on the morning of Thursday, September 25 (which happened to be the 119th anniversary of WaMu's establishment), regulators informed JPMorgan Chase that they were the winners.[16]
On Thursday night (shortly after the close of business on the West Coast), the Office of Thrift Supervision seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC. In a statement, the OTS said that the massive run meant that WaMu was no longer sound.[184] The FDIC, as receiver, sold most of Washington Mutual Bank's assets, including the branch network, to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. JPMorgan agreed to assume the bank's secured debts and liabilities to depositors. The transaction did not require any FDIC insurance funds.[185] Normally, bank seizures take place after the close of business on Fridays. However, due to the bank's deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent, regulators felt compelled to act a day early.[16]
Because JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual's assets for a low price, WaMu's stockholders were nearly wiped out. Its stock price dropped to $0.16 a share, far from $45 a share in 2007.[183] In its Chapter 11 filing, WaMu listed assets of $33 billion and debt of $8 billion. (ref. Appendix A). The filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors.
Within days of the seizure, a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist, Mike Stathis of AVA Investment Analytics, issued a formal complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, demonstrating evidence of insider trading. The complaint also alleged that Washington Mutual was not insolvent, and several Wall Street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock. He also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press who told him that he was contacted by a Washington Mutual executive hours before the seizure, telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons.” In later criticisms, Stathis discussed that neither the FDIC nor OTS ever disclosed any evidence of Washington Mutual's insolvency.[186] Stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint, he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning. As a result of this, Stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the SEC complaint into the public domain until a year later.[187][188]
Shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of Washington Mutual through such websites as WaMuCoup.com (dead link) and others, claiming that the OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of JPMorgan Chase, which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price. Shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover, the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the OTS 2 weeks earlier[189] and that the holding company's board and management was kept completely in the dark about the government's negotiations with Chase, hampering the bank's ability to sell itself on its own. Chief executive Alan H. Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed, and eventually received a $7.5 million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6 million (which he declined) after being CEO for 17 days.[190] Senator Maria Cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation[191] and Washington Mutual's former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares.[189]
The seizure of WaMu Bank resulted in the largest bank failure in American financial history, far exceeding the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984.[16][192][193]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc., and its remaining subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[194] Washington Mutual, Inc., was promptly delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and commenced trading via Pink Sheets. The bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks, after the Lehman Brothers filing eleven days earlier; both bankruptcies far outpaced WorldCom's 2002 filing, which had held the record with just under $104 billion in assets (Washington Mutual's alone, which was approximately half that of Lehman Brothers, was three times as much as WorldCom's).
All assets but only some liabilities (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank were assumed by JPMorgan Chase.[195] Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase acquired all the banking operations of WaMu, including $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits, for a price of $1.9 billion plus debt assumptions.[196] Unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the FDIC, leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery.[195] On Friday, Sep. 26, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank customers were informed that Deposits held by Washington Mutual became now liabilities of JPMorgan Chase.[197]
The IRS claimed $12.5 billion in back taxes from Washington Mutual, Inc.. The company filed court papers on January 22, 2009 alleging losses were $20 billion, and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt, stating that the IRS could owe Washington Mutual Inc. a tax refund.[198] In a settlement between Wash. Mutual Inc. (in receivership), the FDIC, and JPMorgan Chase that Wash. Mutual Inc. recently made public, a tax refund of about US$5.7 billion will be shared between Wash. Mutual Inc., JPMorgan Chase and FDIC.[199]
Washington Mutual, Inc., sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for US$13 billion after the sale of its banking operations to JPMorgan Chase.[200] WMI attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank, and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken.
On January 11, 2010, the United States Department of Justice, Office of the United States Trustee, District of Delaware, pursuant to Section 1102(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, appointed a Committee of Equity Security Holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock. All of the Motions to Disband the Committee of Equity Security Holders were denied on January 28, 2010 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath, District of Delaware.[201][202]
On July 20, 2010, bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath approved a motion of the EC for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of WMI, handing a victory to shareholders. The Judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase at the heart of WaMu's reorganization, but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company.[203]
On July 26, 2010, U.S. Trustee Roberta A. DeAngelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP partner Joshua R. Hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC. Hochberg is a partner in McKenna Long & Aldridge's Washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense, internal investigations and compliance.[204]
On August 10, 2010, the bankruptcy judge rejected Washington Mutual Inc.'s effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting. Attorneys for the EC said that WMI was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information. The judge agreed that WMI was not entitled to the information.[205]
On November 1, 2010, examiner Joshua R. Hochberg from McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP presented his long-awaited report, but it did not meet the expectations of the court, since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorney-client work. On December 12, the court decided to exclude the examiner's report during the plan confirmation hearings, saying it can't be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions.[206]
On January 7, 2011, the bankruptcy court rejected the 6th proposed plan of reorganization, which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Judge Mary Walrath focused many of her criticisms on the company's releases of liability granted to directors, officers and others including some hedge funds, who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement. She noted for example that shareholders, who will likely get nothing, should not have to release the company's board from the threat of being sued by them.[207] However, many WaMu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when Washington Mutual emerges from bankruptcy.
On September 14, 2011, the court also rejected the modified 6th proposed plan of reorganization. Judge Mary F. Walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt. The four hedge funds are Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management.[208]
A seventh plan of reorganization was announced in February 2012[209][210] and the company finally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month as WMI Holdings Corporation.[211] By 2015, WMI Holdings was able to raise $598 million and was looking for new acquisitions.[212]
Post receivership bank operations[edit]
During 2009, all of the Washington Mutual Bank branches that had been purchased from the FDIC after the bank had been placed into receivership, were rebranded to Chase or shuttered. All financial documents issued by WaMu were changed to carry the JPMorgan Chase logo. Credit and debit cards issued by WaMu or Providian were changed to carry the Chase logo.
Since 2009, Chase ATMs have been accessible for WaMu customers at no extra charge, and the branches and accounts were formally merged in 2009 as the WaMu brand was retired.[16] Branches in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Utah were rebranded in May 2009; branches in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Greater New York were rebranded in July 2009, and the remaining branches in Nevada, California, Arizona, and Colorado were rebranded in October 2009.[213][214] The last rebrandings formally retired the WaMu name.
In markets where Chase already had a dominant presence, such as Greater New York and Chicago owing to the presence of Chase and predecessor Bank One (in New York, the merger resulted in different branches on the same block), Chase further disposed of such branches to other banks.[215]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
"Free Checking Account"[edit]
This advertising campaign was introduced between 2005 and 2007. Numerous WaMu commercials showed traditionally-dressed 60-70-year-old overweight bankers laughing out loud at a WaMu representative (who is much younger and fitter), who says the words "Free Checking Account".
"The Power of Yes"[edit]
WaMu introduced an advertising campaign during the 2003 Academy Awards known as “The Power of Yes”. This was to promote the offering of loans to all consumers, particularly borrowers that the banks deemed too risky. Another commercial in the ad series showed WaMu representatives in casual clothes, contrasting with traditionally-dressed bankers in suits.
"Whoo hoo"[edit]




A promotional Washington Mutual "Whoo hoo!" bumper sticker.


"Whoo hoo!" was an advertising campaign introduced by Washington Mutual in February 2008. As fears of an economic crisis were rising, and WaMu was looking to become an "iconic brand that people love", they began courting consumers with a new slogan, designed to position WaMu as a consumer-friendly institution.[216]
During its run, the Whoo hoo! ads, created by TBWA\Chiat\Day of Playa del Rey, California,[216] become widespread in web navigation.[217] After WaMu launched the new advertisement, there was double digit growth at its website[217] and the term “wamu” appeared in searches over 1,000% more between January and March than in all of 2007.[217]
Washington Mutual (before the bank's September 2008 conservatorship and sale to JPMorgan Chase) applied to register a trademark in the phrase.[218][219] Initially, the bank wanted to use "woo hoo" (without the "h" in the first word) as the slogan, but they were concerned because of the existing use of the phrase by Homer Simpson, a character in The Simpsons.[218]
Occasio branch design[edit]
Washington Mutual introduced a unique branch design known as Occasio which eliminated traditional teller windows and queuing stanchions in favor of an open, circular floor plan with a greeter or "concierge" position and tellers working from behind podiums.[220][221] The Occasio design was introduced in 2000 and patented in 2004,[222] but was phased out following the JPMorgan Chase acquisition of Washington Mutual's retail banking operations.[223]

Washington Mutual has 50 branches. Shoreline operates 15 branches, Columbia Federal has 12. An earlier agreement in which Shoreline would sell three branches to Washington Mutual was vetoed by regulators, ostensibly because it would have further weakened the ailing institution.

In one of the Pacific Northwest's biggest financial transactions of its kind, Washington Mutual Savings Bank said today it won the sweepstakes to take control of Pacific First Financial Corp., parent company to Pacific First Bank. The move will make Washington Mutual the second-largest financial institution in Washington and give it a huge initial presence in Oregon. Washington Mutual said it will pay $663 million for the rival institution - both have Seattle headquarters. After the deal is done next May or June, Washington Mutual will be second in size here only to Seafirst Bank. Just three years ago, then publicly held Pacific First was acquired by Royal Trustco of Toronto, Canada, for $212 million. But since then, Royal Trustco has run into problems elsewhere, and decided to abandon its strategy to string branches along the West Coast of the United States. It put Pacific First up for bid.

^ a b c Virgin, Bill (October 28, 1992). "Washington Mutual Plans to Buy Pacific First Bank". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. p. B5. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Savings Bank will buy Pacific First Bank in a deal that cements its position as one of the three leading financial institutions in the Pacific Northwest. It also brings to a somewhat messy and expensive end a foray into the American banking market by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, parent of Pacific First. While Royal Trustco is giving up its dream of building an American banking empire anchored in Seattle, it will be stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate loans that are in default or heading that way. And the $663 million acquisition of Pacific First Financial Corp. marks the third major upheaval of banking in Washington in a year, which will mean more sign changes, building closures and potential layoffs for employees. Washington Mutual already has $8.4 billion in assets and 118 branches and 17 loan centers in Washington and Oregon. Pacific First has assets of $6.9 billion, 127 branches in Washington, Oregon and California and eight mortgage offices. It previously agreed to trade its 10 California branches for Great Western Bank's 14 Washington branches. Once the Pacific First deal is completed, Washington Mutual will have assets of about $14 billion... Pacific First is merely the latest in a series of acquisitions Washington Mutual has made in the last few years, including Pioneer Savings in Lynnwood, Great Northwest in Bremerton and VanFed in Vancouver. With Pacific First's branches, Washington Mutual's share of consumer deposits in Washington will be 17.2 percent, ahead of KeyCorp-Puget Sound with 10.3 percent and trailing only Seafirst at 20.4 percent, Tejera said. In Oregon, Washington Mutual will become the fourth biggest in consumer deposits.

Pacific First Bank, a Seattle-based thrift, has quietly become the largest holder of deposits among all thrifts operating in Oregon. It also operates 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift. Its rise has been due, in part, to turmoil in the thrift industry that has led to deposit declines at competitors and the shift of one large thrift to a bank. Pacific First had $1.1 billion in deposits at its Oregon branches at the end of 1989. A year later, deposits had grown to $2.3 billion. It now holds about 27 percent of the thrift market in Oregon and about 9 percent of the combined thrift and bank market. The next-largest Oregon thrift is Far West Federal Bank with $1.3 billion in deposits... Pacific First has been serving Oregonians since 1936, but it had only a few branches until December 1988, when it bought 17 branches of Salem-based American Home Savings. One year later the thrift was acquired by Toronto, Canada-based Royal Trustco, Canada's largest trust company, which injected $100 million of capital into the thrift and set it on an aggressive expansion course. Pacific First acquired the 45 branches of Willamette Savings and Loan in June and added the 12 Oregon branches of the Williamsburg Federal Savings and Loan Association in September. Some recently acquired branches have been closed, leaving the thrift with 78 Oregon branches spread throughout the state, but principally in the Portland metropolitan area and the Willamette Valley.

In an acquisition that will virtually double the size of the savings bank the day it is completed, Seattle-based Washington Mutual said it will acquire Keystone Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary, American Savings Bank of Irvine, Calif., in a stock deal worth about $1.4 billion, based on yesterday's closing price... In addition, because American's loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward adjustable rate mortgages, the acquisition helps Washington Mutual reduce its vulnerability to interest rate swings... The third attraction for investors is the presence of billionaire investor Robert Bass, who bought into American Savings when it was taken over by the government and reorganized in 1988. He assures me he has totally bought into the business plan. We believe he will be a good long-term shareholder, Killinger said of Bass. Bass will name two additional members to Washington Mutual's board, although Killinger said it's not likely Bass himself will serve... Washington Mutual, already at $22 million in assets, will grow to more than $42 million. It already operates 248 branches in Washington, Oregon, Utah, Idaho and Montana. American Savings will add 158 branches in California... A new shareholder in Washington Mutual will be the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which as part of the bailout of American holds about a third of the company. The FDIC is expected to sell those shares. 
^ a b Adamson, Deborah (July 23, 1996). "American Savings Merging - Washington Mutual to Strengthen Coastal Presence With Deal". Los Angeles Daily News. p. B1. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Inc., a Seattle financial services firm, said Monday it will buy American Savings Bank and its parent company in a stock for stock transaction worth $3.5 billion. Irvine-based American Savings Bank will keep its name, and officials said they expect all branches to remain open, officials said... Washington Mutual, which owns a network of banks, is the No. 1 residential mortgage originator in Washington and Oregon. American Savings is California's second largest home-mortgage originator. The deal gives Washington Mutual its first presence in California, allowing an immediate foothold in key locations that will solidify its West Coast position... Robert M. Bass and his investor group control Keystone Holdings Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, the parent company of American Savings. After the acquisition, Keystone will be merged into Washington Mutual. The investor group will get 26 million of the 48 million shares to be issued by Washington Mutual in the merger. With total outstanding shares of 117.5 million, the group's share amounts to a 22 percent ownership in the new company, with Bass holding an 8 percent stake. About 14 million of the new shares will go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will sell them after the merger. The rest will be held in escrow pending the outcome of a Keystone lawsuit against the federal government. Washington Mutual also will assume Keystone's $365 million of debt and $80 million in outstanding preferred stock. Mario Antoci, American Savings' chairman and CEO, will retire after the deal closes. Post-merger management changes have not been finalized. Antoci took over American Savings in 1988, when the Bass Group bought it. American Savings Bank was originally part of American Savings and Loan, a failed thrift that led to the largest savings and loan bailout in history. The original thrift was divided into two parts: American Savings Bank controlled the profitable assets and loans while the other unit was liquidated. American Savings Bank has 220 branches in California and Arizona. Washington Mutual has 317 branches in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana. 
^ Fuquay, Jim (July 23, 1996). "Bass group bonanza - Keystone Holdings sells a California thrift in a deal valued at $1.6 billion.". Fort Worth Star-Telegram. p. 1. (Subscription required (help)). An investment group led by Fort Worth billionaire Robert M. Bass cashed in on a $400 million investment in California's American Savings yesterday, selling the thrift it acquired less than eight years ago. The deal was valued at more than $1.6 billion. Washington Mutual Inc., the parent of one of Washington state's largest savings banks, agreed to acquire the thrift for at least 40 million shares of Washington Mutual stock. That stock was worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at Friday's closing price. Washington Mutual will also assume $465 million in debt as part of the deal... Bass made his investment through Keystone Holdings, in which he owns about 36 percent. In 1988, Keystone acquired American Savings from the federal government, which had seized the thrift in 1984. Keystone invested $350 million in cash into American Savings and spent another $50 million in expenses to buy the institution, which at the time was America's biggest insolvent thrift. Keystone installed Mario J. Antoci, a respected thrift executive, to run American Savings. The thrift, stripped of its most troubled assets, immediately started making money... The Keystone group will also name two members of Washington Mutual's 13-person board, suggesting that the group is likely to retain its interest in the company.

Hoping to marry the nation's two largest savings and loans into a financial powerhouse, the corporate parent of Home Savings of America has offered to buy Great Western Financial Corp. in a deal valued at nearly $6 billion, sources close to the proposed transaction said late Monday. The unsolicited offer by Irwindale-based H.F. Ahmanson & Co. would form the third-largest financial institution in California--after giant Bank of America and Wells Fargo. It would also result in the closure of more than 100 bank branches and the probable loss of hundreds of jobs, sources said.

Ahmanson and Co.'s $6.2 billion takeover bid yesterday as its bankers met with potential rival suitors, sources close to Great Western said... Sources said possible bidders that Great Western may have contacted include First Bank System Inc., Washington Mutual Savings Bank and Norwest Corp. Local banking executives and analysts said Washington Mutual is likely to take a close look at a deal for Great Western, and said there are equally strong reasons why the Seattle-based thrift might bid or walk away. On the negative side, Washington Mutual is currently digesting a major California acquisition, a hurry-up deal wouldn't give it time to carefully review the transaction, it wouldn't get the same cost savings Ahmanson would to make the deal attractive, and a bidding war could become expensive.

Seattle-based Washington Mutual will acquire Bank United Corp., the largest publicly traded Texas-based financial institution. Texas was something of an incidental market Washington Mutual picked up in its 1998 acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson & Co.; while the real prize in the Ahmanson deal was its huge share of the market in California, it also had 48 branches in Texas, primarily in Houston and Dallas...

The deal, valued at $1.5 billion and expected to close by year's end, will greatly increase Washington Mutual's presence in the state. The Seattle-based institution entered Texas in 1998 with its acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson & Co., parent of Savings of America, and the Bank United merger will give it 3 percent of Texas deposits, according to June 30, 1999, reports, the latest available. Washington Mutual, which ranks No. 8 among all U.S. banks and thrifts, also has a previous Texas connection. In 1995, it acquired American Savings, a California thrift owned by Fort Worth investor Robert M. Bass, who became a major Washington Mutual shareholder as a result of that deal. A Bass lieutenant, Jay Crandall, remains on Washington Mutual's board of directors... Bank United has 155 retail branches in the state, including 77 in North Texas, along with 42 commercial loan offices and 11 other sales offices. Washington Mutual has 48 branches in Texas, including two in Tarrant County... About a dozen Texas branches share overlapping market areas, the companies said.

Washington Mutual, Inc., abbreviated to WaMu, was a savings bank holding company and the former owner of Washington Mutual Bank, which was the United States' largest savings and loan association until its collapse in 2008.[5][6][7][8][9]
On Thursday, September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) seized Washington Mutual Bank from Washington Mutual, Inc. and placed it into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The OTS took the action due to the withdrawal of $16.7 billion in deposits during a 9-day bank run (amounting to 9% of the deposits it had held on June 30, 2008).[10] The FDIC sold the banking subsidiaries (minus unsecured debt and equity claims) to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion, which JPMorgan Chase had been planning to acquire as part of a confidential plan internally nicknamed Project West.[11][12][13] All WaMu branches were rebranded as Chase branches by the end of 2009. The holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc., was left with $33 billion in assets, and $8 billion debt, after being stripped of its banking subsidiary by the FDIC.[6][7][14][15] The next day, September 26, Washington Mutual, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 voluntary bankruptcy in Delaware, where it was incorporated.[7][14]
With respect to total assets under management, Washington Mutual Bank's closure and receivership is the largest bank failure in American financial history.[6][7] Before the receivership action, it was the sixth-largest bank in the United States.[16] According to Washington Mutual Inc.'s 2007 SEC filing, the holding company held assets valued at $327.9 billion.[17]
On March 20, 2009, Washington Mutual Inc. filed suit against the FDIC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking damages of approximately $13 billion for what it claims was an unjustified seizure and an extremely low sale price to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase promptly filed a counterclaim in the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, where the Washington Mutual bankruptcy proceedings had been continuing since the Office of Thrift Supervision's seizure of the holding company's bank subsidiaries.[18][19]

Business operations prior to bank receivership[edit]




A former WaMu branch in the Chinatown section of New York City (2004)


Despite its name, Washington Mutual ceased being a mutual company in 1983 when it demutualized and became a public company on March 11.
On June 30, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank had total assets of US$307 billion, with 2,239 retail branch offices operating in 15 states, with 4,932 ATMs, and 43,198 employees. It held liabilities in the form of deposits of $188.3 billion, and owed $82.9 billion to the Federal Home Loan Bank, and had subordinated debt of $7.8 billion. It held as assets of $118.9 billion in single-family loans, of which $52.9 billion were "option adjustable rate mortgages" (Option ARMs), with $16 billion in subprime mortgage loans, and $53.4 billion of Home Equity lines of Credit (HELOCs) and credit cards receivables of $10.6 billion. It was servicing for itself and other banks loans totaling $689.7 billion, of which $442.7 were for other banks. It had non-performing assets of $11.6 billion, including $3.23 billion in payment option ARMs and $3.0 billion in subprime mortgage loans.[20]
On September 15, 2008, the holding company received a credit rating agency downgrade. From that date through September 24, 2008, WaMu experienced a bank run whereby customers withdrew $16.7 billion in deposits over those 9 days,[15] and in excess of $22 billion in cash outflow since July 2008, both conditions which ultimately led the Office of Thrift Supervision to close the bank.[20]
The FDIC then sold most of the bank's assets to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion in cash plus assumption of all secured debt and some unsecured debt. Claims of the subsidiary bank's equity holders, senior and subordinated debt (all primarily owned by the holding company) were not assumed by JPMorgan Chase[clarification needed].[7][21][22]
History[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower at 1201 Third Avenue in Seattle, Washington


Mutual savings bank[edit]
Washington Mutual was incorporated as the Washington National Building Loan and Investment Association on September 25, 1889, after the Great Seattle Fire destroyed 120 acres (49 ha) of the central business district of Seattle. The newly formed company made its first home mortgage loan on the West Coast on February 10, 1890. It changed its name to Washington Savings and Loan Association on June 25, 1908.[2] By September 12, 1917 it was operating under the name Washington Mutual Savings Bank.[23] The company purchased its first company, the financially distressed Continental Mutual Savings Bank, on July 25, 1930.[2] Its marketing slogan for much of its history was "The Friend of the Family".
Post demutualization growth[edit]
In April 1982, Washington Mutual purchased the brokerage firm Murphey Favre for undisclosed amount in cash[24] and demutualized the following year, converting into a capital stock savings bank.[25] Stock in the capital stock savings bank was first offered for sale on March 11, 1983.[26] By 1989, its assets had doubled.[2]
In November 1994, Washington Mutual formed a new holding called Washington Mutual, Inc. and separated its non-banking units from its primary banking unit, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, which was simultaneously renamed Washington Mutual Bank.[27][28][29] The company's stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under WAMU.
In October 2005, Washington Mutual purchased the formerly "subprime" credit card issuer Providian for approximately $6.5 billion, although Providian's new management team's strategy of targeting Prime credit card consumers had been underway since 2001, therefore the credit card unit's nonperforming loan portfolio had improved significantly prior to the company's sale to WaMu. In March 2006, Washington Mutual began the move into its new headquarters, WaMu Center, located in downtown Seattle. The company's previous headquarters, Washington Mutual Tower, stands about a block away from the new building on Second Avenue. In August 2006, Washington Mutual began using the official abbreviation of WaMu in all but legal situations.
Acquisitions[edit]

After the acquisition of Murphey Favre, WaMu made numerous acquisitions with the aim of expanding the corporation. By acquiring companies including PNC Mortgage, Fleet Mortgage and Homeside Lending, WaMu became the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. With the acquisition of Providian Financial Corporation in October 2005, WaMu became the nation's 9th-largest credit-card company.
A partial list of Washington Mutual acquisitions since demutualization:[30]

Commercial Capital Bancorp, California, 2006
Providian Financial Corporation, California, 2005
HomeSide Lending, Inc., Florida, a unit of National Australia Bank, 2002
Fleet Mortgage Corp., South Carolina, 2001
PNC Mortgage, Illinois, 2001
Alta Residential Mortgage Trust, California, 2000
Long Beach Financial Corp., California, 1999


Many of Washington Mutual's acquisitions became reviled as the rapid post-merger integrations resulted in numerous errors. The purchase of the original PNC Mortgage came at a time when subprime lending was in a "boom" period, with PNC Financial Services believing that the market was too volatile.[31] (PNC later re-entered the mortgage market in 2009 through its acquisition of National City Corp., with no plans to re-enter subprime lending.) The Dime merger resulted in account ownership to be split with account beneficiaries. The Fleet Mortgage merger resulted in entire loans simply disappearing — being serviced, but unable to be found by customer service representatives.[citation needed]
Expansion in Washington[edit]
In April 1983, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of three branch offices from the Tacoma-based United Mutual Savings Bank for $3.25 million.[32]

In January 1990, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of all seven offices of the Seattle-based Old Stone Bank of Washington from the Rhode Island-based Old Stone Corporation for an undisclosed amount.[39][40][41] Old Stone originally entered the state of Washington through the acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association in 1985 with the assistance of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.[42][43][44] The acquisition by Washington Mutual was completed in June 1990 for $10 million.[45][46]

In August 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Seattle-based Sound Savings and Loan Association for an undisclosed amount.[53] At the time of the announcement in August 1991, Washington Mutual had 84 branch offices, all within Washington state.[53] The acquisition by was completed in January 1992.[54]

In December 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of both Washington state branch offices of the California-based World Savings and Loan Association of America, a subsidiary of Golden West Financial, for an undisclosed amount.[58] The acquisition by was completed in March 1992.[59]
In August 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Lynnwood-based Pioneer Savings Bank for $181 million in stock.[60][61][62] The acquisition by was completed in March 1993.[63]
 In October 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Pacific First Financial Corporation with its Pacific First Bank subsidiary for $663 million from its Canada-based parent Royal Trustco. The acquisition was contingent on having Pacific First dispose of its branch offices in California and having its Canadian parent Royal Trustco assume all of Pacific First's bad loans.[64][65][66] The acquisition by was completed in April 1993.[67] At the time of the initial announcement in October 1992, Washington Mutual had 118 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Pacific First had 127 branch offices in Washington, Oregon and California. Pacific First had previously announced that it was trading its California offices for Great Western's Washington offices. As a result of the Pacific First acquisition, Washington Mutual became one of the largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits in the state of Washington, second only to Seafirst.[66]
In June 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Summit Bancorp with its Summit Savings Bank subsidiary for $25 million in stock.[68] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 231 branch offices in Washington and Oregon.

Unlike the previous acquisition targets, Enterprise held a commercial bank charter and not a thrift charter.
Expansion in Oregon[edit]
In April 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the 25 offices in the Portland, Oregon / Vancouver, Washington area from the ailing New York-based CrossLand Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Brooklyn Bancorp, for an undisclosed amount.[73] The acquisition by was completed in November 1991.[52] Seven of the 25 offices were located in Washington with the remainder in Oregon. As part of the transaction, CrossLand Savings closed seven offices in Oregon and three offices in Washington, leaving eleven offices in Oregon and four in Washington.[52] CrossLand had previously entered Oregon (and three other states) through the relatively recent acquisition of the troubled Utah-based Western Savings and Loan Association.[74][75][76] The CrossLand acquisition gave Washington Mutual a toe hold entry into Oregon via Portland.
As a result of the Pacific First acquisition in April 1993, Washington Mutual became the fourth largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits within the state of Oregon.[66] Originally, Pacific First grew quickly in Oregon during the late 1980s through the acquisition of troubled savings and loans.[77][78] By February 1991, Pacific First had 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift.[79] Pacific First had 71 branches in Oregon by July 1992.[80]
In April 1994, Washington Mutual announced the completed acquisition of three Portland-area offices of the failed Portland-based Far West Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $2.2 million.[81]
In October 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Coos Bay-based Western Bank for $156 million in stock.[82][83][84][85] The acquisition by was completed in February 1996.[86] Since Western Bank possessed a commercial bank charter and not a more restrictive savings & loan charter, Washington Mutual decided to allow Western Bank to keep its charter and name and to remain semi-autonomous for a while. At the time of the acquisition, Western Bank had 41 offices throughout Oregon. Five years later, Washington Mutual decided to abandon the Western Bank brand and integrate most of the former Western Bank offices into the existing Washington Mutual network in Oregon in 2001.[87][88] Due to branch overlaps between the two brands, 12 Western Bank branch offices and one Washington Mutual branch office were sold to the Klamath Falls-based Klamath First Bancorp for $33 million.[89][90]
Expansion in Idaho[edit]
In March 1994, Washington Mutual announced that they were planning to expand into the state of Idaho by building new branch offices inside Fred Meyer supermarket stores with the first three being opened in the Boise-area in July and August.[91][92][93][94]
In the following year, Washington Mutual opened a fourth Idaho location in a Moscow supermarket in February 1995.[95]
A branch office in Idaho Falls was acquired from the Utah-based United Savings Bank when Washington Mutual purchased the savings bank in January 1997.[96]
By March 2000, there were 9 locations within Idaho[97] and later 22 locations in 2008 when Chase acquired Washington Mutual.[98]
Expansion in Utah[edit]
In July 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank, FSB, subsidiary for $52.1 million in stock.[99][100] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 250 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Olympus had eight branch offices in Utah and two in Montana. The acquisition by was completed in May 1995.[101]
In March 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Ogden-based Utah Federal Savings Bank for an undisclosed amount.[102][103] At the time of the announcement, Utah Federal had five branch offices while Washington Mutual had 16 within Utah. The acquisition by was completed in December 1996 for $15.2 million.[104]
In September 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based United Western Financial Group Inc. with its United Savings Bank subsidiary for $80.3 million in cash.[105][106][107][108] At the time of the announcement, United Savings Bank had eight branch offices in Utah and one in Idaho. The acquisition by was completed in January 1997.[96]
Expansion in Montana[edit]
In May 1995, Washington Mutual acquired two branch offices in Butte as the result of the acquisition of the Utah-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank FSB subsidiary. Four years later, Washington Mutual later sold the two offices to Glacier Bancorp in 1999 for an undisclosed amount and quietly left the state of Montana.[109][110]
Expansion in California[edit]
 In July 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Fort Worth, Texas-based Keystone Holdings Inc. with its Irvine-based American Savings Bank subsidiary for $1.6 billion in stock.[111][112][113][114][115][116] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 317 branch offices in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana while American Savings Bank had 220 branch offices in California.[115] The acquisition by was completed in December 1996.[117][118][119][120] American kept its name after the acquisition. The result of the acquisition nearly doubled the total deposits of all Washington Mutual subsidiaries from $22 billion to $42 billion.
In February 1997, the Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial, the holding company for second largest thrift in the nation Great Western Bank, found itself the target of a hostile takeover attempt of arch-rival H. F. Ahmanson & Co., the holding company for the largest thrift in the nation Home Savings of America, that would have involved $5.8 billion worth of stock. Since the two companies had large overlapping territories, many Great Western offices would have been closed by the victor if the takeover attempt had succeeded.[121][122][123] The only way the combat a hostile takeover was to find another company, called a white knight that would allow a merger on much better terms. One such company was Washington Mutual. In March, Great Western Financial announced that it had accepted Washington Mutual's merger proposal for $6.6 billion in Washington Mutual stock.[124][125][126] Ahmanson quickly increased their bids[127] but the bids were also rejected.[128] Great Western approved the merger with Washington Mutual in June[129] and the merger was completed in July.[130][131] As part of its merger agreement, it was originally announced that Great Western offices would be allowed to keep the Great Western name and there were later discussion of converting the American Savings offices to the Great Western brand. In the end, it was felt that it was best for the company to have only one brand throughout the nation instead of multiple regional brands so it was announce in December 1997 that both Great Western and American names would be retired in favor of the Washington Mutual name.[132] The previous month, it was announced in November that 85 redundant branch offices were identified in California and were to be closed within the following year.[133][134] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 413 branch operating under various names across the country while Great Western had 416 branch offices operating in California and Florida.[135]
In March 1998, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irwindale-based H. F. Ahmanson & Company with its Home Savings of America subsidiary for approximately $10 billion in stock.[136][137][138] The acquisition by was completed in October 1998 for only $6.9 billion in stock.[139] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 892 branch operating under various names (Washington Mutual, American Savings, Great Western, etc.) across the country while Home Savings had 409 branch offices operating in California and Texas.[140][141] A few days after the completion of the merger, Washington Mutual announces plans to close 161 branch offices in California.[142][143]
Expansion in Texas[edit]
Through the 1998 acquisition of Home Savings, Washington Mutual had gained 48 branch offices in Texas.
In August 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Houston-based Bank United Corporation with its 155 branch offices, all located in Texas, for $1.49 billion in stock.[144][145][146] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[147][148]
As a result of branch overlap between Bank United and Washington Mutual, 17 branch offices were closed in Texas, 10 of which were in Houston.[149] [150]
Expansion in New York[edit]
In June 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the New York City-based Dime Bancorp with its Dime Savings Bank subsidiary for $5.2 billion in cash and stock.[151][152] The acquisition by was completed in January 2002.[153] Dime had 123 branch offices in the New York City area of both New York and New Jersey.[154]
Commercial banking[edit]
With a thrift charter, there were a few things that Washington Mutual was not able to do until it was able to obtain a commercial bank charter, such as making commercial loans above a certain size. To get around this problem, Washington Mutual began to purchase commercial banks and maintain them as separate business entities. In August 1995, Washington Mutual acquired the one office Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank in Washington. A few months later, Washington Mutual acquired the 41 office Coos Bay-based Western Bank in Oregon.[86] By 2007, Enterprise was merged into Western and operated as branch of Western.[155]
After Washington Mutual expanded into California through the acquisitions of American Savings, Great Western, and Home Savings, Washington Mutual quietly acquired the one-office Industrial Bank in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles an undisclosed amount in 1999[156][157] and renamed it WM Business Bank.[156]
By 2001, Washington Mutual had 38 specialized business banking centers operating under the Western Bank name in the Northwest and the WM Business Bank name in California when they decided to exit the commercial banking market that was then dominated with the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America.[87]
Mortgage banking[edit]
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Washington Mutual decided to aggressively expand in the subprime mortgage lending field through the acquisition of existing mortgage companies at a time when other financial institutions were leaving.
In May 1999, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Orange, California-based Long Beach Financial Corporation with its Long Beach Mortgage Company subsidiary for $350.4 million in cash and stock.[158][159] The acquisition by was completed in October 1999.[160] Long Beach had specialized in providing subprime mortgages. Some of Long Beach's questionable business practices may have led to Washington Mutual's failure in 2008.[161]
In January 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Los Angeles-based Alta Residential Mortgage Trust for $23 million.[162]
In October 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based PNC Mortgage Corporation and PNC Mortgage Securities Corporation from the PNC Financial Services Group for $605 million in cash.[163][164] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[165] The result of the PNC Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's third-largest lender.
In April 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Columbia, South Carolina-based Fleet Mortgage Corporation from FleetBoston Financial for $660 million in cash.[166] The acquisition by was completed in June 2001.[167] The result of the Fleet Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's second-largest mortgage-servicing business.
In December 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Jacksonville, Florida-based HomeSide Lending, Inc. from the National Australia Bank for $1.9 billion. The agreement did not include the mortgage servicing rights and related financial hedges for the business.[168][169] The acquisition by was completed in March 2002.[170] In August 2002, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the rest of HomeSide that included the mortgage servicing rights on a mortgage portfolio worth about $131 billion for $1.3 billion in cash and the assumption of $735 million in debt.[171] The acquisition by was completed in October 2002.[172]
In July 2002, the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Capital Corporation announced the pending sale of the mortgage loan portfolio for its Bay View Bank subsidiary to Washington Mutual for a "slight premium to book value".[173] The sale by was completed in the following month.[174]
In April 2006, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irvine, California-based Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. with its Commercial Capital Bank FSB subsidiary for $983 million in cash.[175][176] The acquisition by was completed in October 2006.[177] Commercial Capital had specialized in loans for the multifamily and small commercial real estate lending markets and was the third largest multifamily lender in California.
Rise and fall[edit]
"Wal-Mart of Banking"[edit]
Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger had pledged in 2003: "We hope to do to this industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe's, Home Depot did to their industry. And I think if we’ve done our job, five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank."[178]
Killinger's goal was to build WaMu into the "Wal-Mart of Banking", which would cater to lower- and middle-class consumers that other banks deemed too risky. Complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing, a strategy the bank extended in big cities, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. WaMu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets. WaMu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than $10,000 for bringing in borrowers. Variable-rate loans — Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (Option ARMs) in particular — were especially attractive, because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed WaMu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred. As WaMu was selling many of its loans to investors, it worried less about defaults.[9][178]
Subprime losses[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower (center right) in downtown Seattle was Washington Mutual's corporate headquarters from 1988 until 2006, when the company moved into the new WaMu Center (center left). These buildings have since been renamed; Washington Mutual Tower is now known as 1201 Third Avenue and WaMu Center is now known as Russell Investments Center.


In December 2007, the subsidiary Washington Mutual Bank reorganized its home-loan division, closing 160 of its 336 home-loan offices and removing 2,600 positions in its home-loan staff (a 22% reduction).[179]
In March 2008, on the same weekend that JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon negotiated the takeover of Bear Stearns, he secretly dispatched members of his team to Seattle to meet with WaMu executives, urging them to consider a quick deal. However, WaMu Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger rejected JPMorgan Chase's offer that valued WaMu at $8 a share, mostly in stock.[9][178]
In April 2008, the holding company, responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis, announced that 3,000 people companywide would lose their jobs, and the company stated its intent to close its approximately 176 remaining stand-alone, home-loan offices, including 23 in Washington and a loan-processing center in Bellevue, Washington. It stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as "wholesale lending." WaMu also announced a $7 billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by TPG Capital. TPG agreed to pump $2 billion into the Washington Mutual holding company; other investors, including some of WaMu's current institutional holders, agreed to buy an additional $5 billion in newly issued stock. This angered many investors, as TPG's investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, and as WaMu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses.[180]
In June 2008, Kerry Killinger stepped down as the Chairman, though remaining the Chief Executive Officer.[181] On September 8, 2008, under pressure from investors, the Washington Mutual holding company's board of directors dismissed Killinger as the CEO. Alan H. Fishman, chairman of mortgage broker Meridian Capital Group, and a former chief operating officer of Sovereign Bank, was named the new CEO for 17 days.[182]
Seizure by OTS and FDIC[edit]
By mid-September 2008, WaMu's share price had closed as low as $2.00. It had been worth over $30.00 in September 2007, and had briefly traded as high as $45 in the previous year.[183] While WaMu publicly insisted it could stay independent, earlier in the month it had quietly hired Goldman Sachs to identify potential bidders. However, several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid.[16] At the same time, WaMu suffered a massive run (mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfer[citation needed]); customers pulled out $16.7 billion in deposits in a ten-day span.[184]
This led the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to step up pressure for WaMu to find a buyer, as a takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could have been a severe drain on the FDIC insurance fund, which had already been hard hit by the failure of IndyMac that year. The FDIC ultimately held a secret auction of Washington Mutual Bank. Finally, on the morning of Thursday, September 25 (which happened to be the 119th anniversary of WaMu's establishment), regulators informed JPMorgan Chase that they were the winners.[16]
On Thursday night (shortly after the close of business on the West Coast), the Office of Thrift Supervision seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC. In a statement, the OTS said that the massive run meant that WaMu was no longer sound.[184] The FDIC, as receiver, sold most of Washington Mutual Bank's assets, including the branch network, to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. JPMorgan agreed to assume the bank's secured debts and liabilities to depositors. The transaction did not require any FDIC insurance funds.[185] Normally, bank seizures take place after the close of business on Fridays. However, due to the bank's deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent, regulators felt compelled to act a day early.[16]
Because JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual's assets for a low price, WaMu's stockholders were nearly wiped out. Its stock price dropped to $0.16 a share, far from $45 a share in 2007.[183] In its Chapter 11 filing, WaMu listed assets of $33 billion and debt of $8 billion. (ref. Appendix A). The filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors.
Within days of the seizure, a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist, Mike Stathis of AVA Investment Analytics, issued a formal complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, demonstrating evidence of insider trading. The complaint also alleged that Washington Mutual was not insolvent, and several Wall Street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock. He also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press who told him that he was contacted by a Washington Mutual executive hours before the seizure, telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons.” In later criticisms, Stathis discussed that neither the FDIC nor OTS ever disclosed any evidence of Washington Mutual's insolvency.[186] Stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint, he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning. As a result of this, Stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the SEC complaint into the public domain until a year later.[187][188]
Shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of Washington Mutual through such websites as WaMuCoup.com (dead link) and others, claiming that the OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of JPMorgan Chase, which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price. Shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover, the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the OTS 2 weeks earlier[189] and that the holding company's board and management was kept completely in the dark about the government's negotiations with Chase, hampering the bank's ability to sell itself on its own. Chief executive Alan H. Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed, and eventually received a $7.5 million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6 million (which he declined) after being CEO for 17 days.[190] Senator Maria Cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation[191] and Washington Mutual's former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares.[189]
The seizure of WaMu Bank resulted in the largest bank failure in American financial history, far exceeding the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984.[16][192][193]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc., and its remaining subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[194] Washington Mutual, Inc., was promptly delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and commenced trading via Pink Sheets. The bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks, after the Lehman Brothers filing eleven days earlier; both bankruptcies far outpaced WorldCom's 2002 filing, which had held the record with just under $104 billion in assets (Washington Mutual's alone, which was approximately half that of Lehman Brothers, was three times as much as WorldCom's).
All assets but only some liabilities (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank were assumed by JPMorgan Chase.[195] Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase acquired all the banking operations of WaMu, including $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits, for a price of $1.9 billion plus debt assumptions.[196] Unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the FDIC, leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery.[195] On Friday, Sep. 26, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank customers were informed that Deposits held by Washington Mutual became now liabilities of JPMorgan Chase.[197]
The IRS claimed $12.5 billion in back taxes from Washington Mutual, Inc.. The company filed court papers on January 22, 2009 alleging losses were $20 billion, and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt, stating that the IRS could owe Washington Mutual Inc. a tax refund.[198] In a settlement between Wash. Mutual Inc. (in receivership), the FDIC, and JPMorgan Chase that Wash. Mutual Inc. recently made public, a tax refund of about US$5.7 billion will be shared between Wash. Mutual Inc., JPMorgan Chase and FDIC.[199]
Washington Mutual, Inc., sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for US$13 billion after the sale of its banking operations to JPMorgan Chase.[200] WMI attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank, and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken.
On January 11, 2010, the United States Department of Justice, Office of the United States Trustee, District of Delaware, pursuant to Section 1102(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, appointed a Committee of Equity Security Holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock. All of the Motions to Disband the Committee of Equity Security Holders were denied on January 28, 2010 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath, District of Delaware.[201][202]
On July 20, 2010, bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath approved a motion of the EC for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of WMI, handing a victory to shareholders. The Judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase at the heart of WaMu's reorganization, but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company.[203]
On July 26, 2010, U.S. Trustee Roberta A. DeAngelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP partner Joshua R. Hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC. Hochberg is a partner in McKenna Long & Aldridge's Washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense, internal investigations and compliance.[204]
On August 10, 2010, the bankruptcy judge rejected Washington Mutual Inc.'s effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting. Attorneys for the EC said that WMI was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information. The judge agreed that WMI was not entitled to the information.[205]
On November 1, 2010, examiner Joshua R. Hochberg from McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP presented his long-awaited report, but it did not meet the expectations of the court, since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorney-client work. On December 12, the court decided to exclude the examiner's report during the plan confirmation hearings, saying it can't be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions.[206]
On January 7, 2011, the bankruptcy court rejected the 6th proposed plan of reorganization, which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Judge Mary Walrath focused many of her criticisms on the company's releases of liability granted to directors, officers and others including some hedge funds, who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement. She noted for example that shareholders, who will likely get nothing, should not have to release the company's board from the threat of being sued by them.[207] However, many WaMu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when Washington Mutual emerges from bankruptcy.
On September 14, 2011, the court also rejected the modified 6th proposed plan of reorganization. Judge Mary F. Walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt. The four hedge funds are Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management.[208]
A seventh plan of reorganization was announced in February 2012[209][210] and the company finally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month as WMI Holdings Corporation.[211] By 2015, WMI Holdings was able to raise $598 million and was looking for new acquisitions.[212]
Post receivership bank operations[edit]
During 2009, all of the Washington Mutual Bank branches that had been purchased from the FDIC after the bank had been placed into receivership, were rebranded to Chase or shuttered. All financial documents issued by WaMu were changed to carry the JPMorgan Chase logo. Credit and debit cards issued by WaMu or Providian were changed to carry the Chase logo.
Since 2009, Chase ATMs have been accessible for WaMu customers at no extra charge, and the branches and accounts were formally merged in 2009 as the WaMu brand was retired.[16] Branches in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Utah were rebranded in May 2009; branches in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Greater New York were rebranded in July 2009, and the remaining branches in Nevada, California, Arizona, and Colorado were rebranded in October 2009.[213][214] The last rebrandings formally retired the WaMu name.
In markets where Chase already had a dominant presence, such as Greater New York and Chicago owing to the presence of Chase and predecessor Bank One (in New York, the merger resulted in different branches on the same block), Chase further disposed of such branches to other banks.[215]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
"Free Checking Account"[edit]
This advertising campaign was introduced between 2005 and 2007. Numerous WaMu commercials showed traditionally-dressed 60-70-year-old overweight bankers laughing out loud at a WaMu representative (who is much younger and fitter), who says the words "Free Checking Account".
"The Power of Yes"[edit]
WaMu introduced an advertising campaign during the 2003 Academy Awards known as “The Power of Yes”. This was to promote the offering of loans to all consumers, particularly borrowers that the banks deemed too risky. Another commercial in the ad series showed WaMu representatives in casual clothes, contrasting with traditionally-dressed bankers in suits.
"Whoo hoo"[edit]




A promotional Washington Mutual "Whoo hoo!" bumper sticker.


"Whoo hoo!" was an advertising campaign introduced by Washington Mutual in February 2008. As fears of an economic crisis were rising, and WaMu was looking to become an "iconic brand that people love", they began courting consumers with a new slogan, designed to position WaMu as a consumer-friendly institution.[216]
During its run, the Whoo hoo! ads, created by TBWA\Chiat\Day of Playa del Rey, California,[216] become widespread in web navigation.[217] After WaMu launched the new advertisement, there was double digit growth at its website[217] and the term “wamu” appeared in searches over 1,000% more between January and March than in all of 2007.[217]
Washington Mutual (before the bank's September 2008 conservatorship and sale to JPMorgan Chase) applied to register a trademark in the phrase.[218][219] Initially, the bank wanted to use "woo hoo" (without the "h" in the first word) as the slogan, but they were concerned because of the existing use of the phrase by Homer Simpson, a character in The Simpsons.[218]
Occasio branch design[edit]
Washington Mutual introduced a unique branch design known as Occasio which eliminated traditional teller windows and queuing stanchions in favor of an open, circular floor plan with a greeter or "concierge" position and tellers working from behind podiums.[220][221] The Occasio design was introduced in 2000 and patented in 2004,[222] but was phased out following the JPMorgan Chase acquisition of Washington Mutual's retail banking operations.[223]

The move will make Washington Mutual the second-largest financial institution in Washington and give it a huge initial presence in Oregon. Washington Mutual said it will pay $663 million for the rival institution - both have Seattle headquarters. After the deal is done next May or June, Washington Mutual will be second in size here only to Seafirst Bank. Just three years ago, then publicly held Pacific First was acquired by Royal Trustco of Toronto, Canada, for $212 million. But since then, Royal Trustco has run into problems elsewhere, and decided to abandon its strategy to string branches along the West Coast of the United States. It put Pacific First up for bid.

^ a b c Virgin, Bill (October 28, 1992). "Washington Mutual Plans to Buy Pacific First Bank". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. p. B5. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Savings Bank will buy Pacific First Bank in a deal that cements its position as one of the three leading financial institutions in the Pacific Northwest. It also brings to a somewhat messy and expensive end a foray into the American banking market by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, parent of Pacific First. While Royal Trustco is giving up its dream of building an American banking empire anchored in Seattle, it will be stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate loans that are in default or heading that way. And the $663 million acquisition of Pacific First Financial Corp. marks the third major upheaval of banking in Washington in a year, which will mean more sign changes, building closures and potential layoffs for employees. Washington Mutual already has $8.4 billion in assets and 118 branches and 17 loan centers in Washington and Oregon. Pacific First has assets of $6.9 billion, 127 branches in Washington, Oregon and California and eight mortgage offices. It previously agreed to trade its 10 California branches for Great Western Bank's 14 Washington branches. Once the Pacific First deal is completed, Washington Mutual will have assets of about $14 billion... Pacific First is merely the latest in a series of acquisitions Washington Mutual has made in the last few years, including Pioneer Savings in Lynnwood, Great Northwest in Bremerton and VanFed in Vancouver. With Pacific First's branches, Washington Mutual's share of consumer deposits in Washington will be 17.2 percent, ahead of KeyCorp-Puget Sound with 10.3 percent and trailing only Seafirst at 20.4 percent, Tejera said. In Oregon, Washington Mutual will become the fourth biggest in consumer deposits.

^ MacKenzie, Bill (February 22, 1991). "Pacific First Tops Oregon Thrifts". The Oregonian. p. E15. (Subscription required (help)). Pacific First Bank, a Seattle-based thrift, has quietly become the largest holder of deposits among all thrifts operating in Oregon. It also operates 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift. Its rise has been due, in part, to turmoil in the thrift industry that has led to deposit declines at competitors and the shift of one large thrift to a bank. Pacific First had $1.1 billion in deposits at its Oregon branches at the end of 1989. A year later, deposits had grown to $2.3 billion. It now holds about 27 percent of the thrift market in Oregon and about 9 percent of the combined thrift and bank market. The next-largest Oregon thrift is Far West Federal Bank with $1.3 billion in deposits... Pacific First has been serving Oregonians since 1936, but it had only a few branches until December 1988, when it bought 17 branches of Salem-based American Home Savings. One year later the thrift was acquired by Toronto, Canada-based Royal Trustco, Canada's largest trust company, which injected $100 million of capital into the thrift and set it on an aggressive expansion course. Pacific First acquired the 45 branches of Willamette Savings and Loan in June and added the 12 Oregon branches of the Williamsburg Federal Savings and Loan Association in September. Some recently acquired branches have been closed, leaving the thrift with 78 Oregon branches spread throughout the state, but principally in the Portland metropolitan area and the Willamette Valley.

In a deal that will both expand it geographically and diversify its lines of business, Washington Mutual Inc. said yesterday it has an agreement to buy Western Bank of Coos Bay, Ore... Western Bank has 41 offices in 33 Oregon communities, so the acquisition will add to Washington Mutual's 72 branches in that state. It also adds 20 towns Washington Mutual isn't already in. Washington Mutual is already the leading residential real estate lender in Oregon. But the deal also increases Washington Mutual's reach into the commercial banking market. Washington Mutual has traditionally emphasized the thrift business, which means home mortgage and consumer loans. Western, being a commercial bank, focuses on lending to small- and medium-sized businesses. Commercial banking is a business Washington Mutual has been increasingly interested in. Last month it wrapped up a deal to acquire the 90 percent of Bellevue's Enterprise Bank it didn't already own.

In an acquisition that will virtually double the size of the savings bank the day it is completed, Seattle-based Washington Mutual said it will acquire Keystone Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary, American Savings Bank of Irvine, Calif., in a stock deal worth about $1.4 billion, based on yesterday's closing price... In addition, because American's loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward adjustable rate mortgages, the acquisition helps Washington Mutual reduce its vulnerability to interest rate swings... The third attraction for investors is the presence of billionaire investor Robert Bass, who bought into American Savings when it was taken over by the government and reorganized in 1988. He assures me he has totally bought into the business plan. We believe he will be a good long-term shareholder, Killinger said of Bass. Bass will name two additional members to Washington Mutual's board, although Killinger said it's not likely Bass himself will serve... Washington Mutual, already at $22 million in assets, will grow to more than $42 million. It already operates 248 branches in Washington, Oregon, Utah, Idaho and Montana.

^ a b Adamson, Deborah (July 23, 1996). "American Savings Merging - Washington Mutual to Strengthen Coastal Presence With Deal". Los Angeles Daily News. p. B1. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Inc., a Seattle financial services firm, said Monday it will buy American Savings Bank and its parent company in a stock for stock transaction worth $3.5 billion. Irvine-based American Savings Bank will keep its name, and officials said they expect all branches to remain open, officials said... Washington Mutual, which owns a network of banks, is the No. 1 residential mortgage originator in Washington and Oregon. American Savings is California's second largest home-mortgage originator. The deal gives Washington Mutual its first presence in California, allowing an immediate foothold in key locations that will solidify its West Coast position... Robert M. Bass and his investor group control Keystone Holdings Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, the parent company of American Savings. After the acquisition, Keystone will be merged into Washington Mutual. The investor group will get 26 million of the 48 million shares to be issued by Washington Mutual in the merger. With total outstanding shares of 117.5 million, the group's share amounts to a 22 percent ownership in the new company, with Bass holding an 8 percent stake. About 14 million of the new shares will go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will sell them after the merger. The rest will be held in escrow pending the outcome of a Keystone lawsuit against the federal government. Washington Mutual also will assume Keystone's $365 million of debt and $80 million in outstanding preferred stock. Mario Antoci, American Savings' chairman and CEO, will retire after the deal closes. Post-merger management changes have not been finalized. Antoci took over American Savings in 1988, when the Bass Group bought it. American Savings Bank was originally part of American Savings and Loan, a failed thrift that led to the largest savings and loan bailout in history. The original thrift was divided into two parts: American Savings Bank controlled the profitable assets and loans while the other unit was liquidated. American Savings Bank has 220 branches in California and Arizona. Washington Mutual has 317 branches in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana. 
^ Fuquay, Jim (July 23, 1996). "Bass group bonanza - Keystone Holdings sells a California thrift in a deal valued at $1.6 billion.". Fort Worth Star-Telegram. p. 1. (Subscription required (help)). An investment group led by Fort Worth billionaire Robert M. Bass cashed in on a $400 million investment in California's American Savings yesterday, selling the thrift it acquired less than eight years ago. The deal was valued at more than $1.6 billion. Washington Mutual Inc., the parent of one of Washington state's largest savings banks, agreed to acquire the thrift for at least 40 million shares of Washington Mutual stock. That stock was worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at Friday's closing price. Washington Mutual will also assume $465 million in debt as part of the deal... Bass made his investment through Keystone Holdings, in which he owns about 36 percent. In 1988, Keystone acquired American Savings from the federal government, which had seized the thrift in 1984. Keystone invested $350 million in cash into American Savings and spent another $50 million in expenses to buy the institution, which at the time was America's biggest insolvent thrift. Keystone installed Mario J. Antoci, a respected thrift executive, to run American Savings. The thrift, stripped of its most troubled assets, immediately started making money... The Keystone group will also name two members of Washington Mutual's 13-person board, suggesting that the group is likely to retain its interest in the company.

The unsolicited offer by Irwindale-based H.F. Ahmanson & Co. would form the third-largest financial institution in California--after giant Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

On the negative side, Washington Mutual is currently digesting a major California acquisition, a hurry-up deal wouldn't give it time to carefully review the transaction, it wouldn't get the same cost savings Ahmanson would to make the deal attractive, and a bidding war could become expensive.

Texas was something of an incidental market Washington Mutual picked up in its 1998 acquisition of H.F.

Ahmanson & Co., parent of Savings of America, and the Bank United merger will give it 3 percent of Texas deposits, according to June 30, 1999, reports, the latest available. Washington Mutual, which ranks No. 8 among all U.S. banks and thrifts, also has a previous Texas connection. In 1995, it acquired American Savings, a California thrift owned by Fort Worth investor Robert M. Bass, who became a major Washington Mutual shareholder as a result of that deal. A Bass lieutenant, Jay Crandall, remains on Washington Mutual's board of directors... Bank United has 155 retail branches in the state, including 77 in North Texas, along with 42 commercial loan offices and 11 other sales offices.

Washington Mutual, Inc., abbreviated to WaMu, was a savings bank holding company and the former owner of Washington Mutual Bank, which was the United States' largest savings and loan association until its collapse in 2008.[5][6][7][8][9]
On Thursday, September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) seized Washington Mutual Bank from Washington Mutual, Inc. and placed it into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The OTS took the action due to the withdrawal of $16.7 billion in deposits during a 9-day bank run (amounting to 9% of the deposits it had held on June 30, 2008).[10] The FDIC sold the banking subsidiaries (minus unsecured debt and equity claims) to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion, which JPMorgan Chase had been planning to acquire as part of a confidential plan internally nicknamed Project West.[11][12][13] All WaMu branches were rebranded as Chase branches by the end of 2009. The holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc., was left with $33 billion in assets, and $8 billion debt, after being stripped of its banking subsidiary by the FDIC.[6][7][14][15] The next day, September 26, Washington Mutual, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 voluntary bankruptcy in Delaware, where it was incorporated.[7][14]
With respect to total assets under management, Washington Mutual Bank's closure and receivership is the largest bank failure in American financial history.[6][7] Before the receivership action, it was the sixth-largest bank in the United States.[16] According to Washington Mutual Inc.'s 2007 SEC filing, the holding company held assets valued at $327.9 billion.[17]
On March 20, 2009, Washington Mutual Inc. filed suit against the FDIC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking damages of approximately $13 billion for what it claims was an unjustified seizure and an extremely low sale price to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase promptly filed a counterclaim in the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, where the Washington Mutual bankruptcy proceedings had been continuing since the Office of Thrift Supervision's seizure of the holding company's bank subsidiaries.[18][19]

Business operations prior to bank receivership[edit]




A former WaMu branch in the Chinatown section of New York City (2004)


Despite its name, Washington Mutual ceased being a mutual company in 1983 when it demutualized and became a public company on March 11.
On June 30, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank had total assets of US$307 billion, with 2,239 retail branch offices operating in 15 states, with 4,932 ATMs, and 43,198 employees. It held liabilities in the form of deposits of $188.3 billion, and owed $82.9 billion to the Federal Home Loan Bank, and had subordinated debt of $7.8 billion. It held as assets of $118.9 billion in single-family loans, of which $52.9 billion were "option adjustable rate mortgages" (Option ARMs), with $16 billion in subprime mortgage loans, and $53.4 billion of Home Equity lines of Credit (HELOCs) and credit cards receivables of $10.6 billion. It was servicing for itself and other banks loans totaling $689.7 billion, of which $442.7 were for other banks. It had non-performing assets of $11.6 billion, including $3.23 billion in payment option ARMs and $3.0 billion in subprime mortgage loans.[20]
On September 15, 2008, the holding company received a credit rating agency downgrade. From that date through September 24, 2008, WaMu experienced a bank run whereby customers withdrew $16.7 billion in deposits over those 9 days,[15] and in excess of $22 billion in cash outflow since July 2008, both conditions which ultimately led the Office of Thrift Supervision to close the bank.[20]
The FDIC then sold most of the bank's assets to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion in cash plus assumption of all secured debt and some unsecured debt. Claims of the subsidiary bank's equity holders, senior and subordinated debt (all primarily owned by the holding company) were not assumed by JPMorgan Chase[clarification needed].[7][21][22]
History[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower at 1201 Third Avenue in Seattle, Washington


Mutual savings bank[edit]
Washington Mutual was incorporated as the Washington National Building Loan and Investment Association on September 25, 1889, after the Great Seattle Fire destroyed 120 acres (49 ha) of the central business district of Seattle. The newly formed company made its first home mortgage loan on the West Coast on February 10, 1890. It changed its name to Washington Savings and Loan Association on June 25, 1908.[2] By September 12, 1917 it was operating under the name Washington Mutual Savings Bank.[23] The company purchased its first company, the financially distressed Continental Mutual Savings Bank, on July 25, 1930.[2] Its marketing slogan for much of its history was "The Friend of the Family".
Post demutualization growth[edit]
In April 1982, Washington Mutual purchased the brokerage firm Murphey Favre for undisclosed amount in cash[24] and demutualized the following year, converting into a capital stock savings bank.[25] Stock in the capital stock savings bank was first offered for sale on March 11, 1983.[26] By 1989, its assets had doubled.[2]
In November 1994, Washington Mutual formed a new holding called Washington Mutual, Inc. and separated its non-banking units from its primary banking unit, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, which was simultaneously renamed Washington Mutual Bank.[27][28][29] The company's stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under WAMU.
In October 2005, Washington Mutual purchased the formerly "subprime" credit card issuer Providian for approximately $6.5 billion, although Providian's new management team's strategy of targeting Prime credit card consumers had been underway since 2001, therefore the credit card unit's nonperforming loan portfolio had improved significantly prior to the company's sale to WaMu. In March 2006, Washington Mutual began the move into its new headquarters, WaMu Center, located in downtown Seattle. The company's previous headquarters, Washington Mutual Tower, stands about a block away from the new building on Second Avenue. In August 2006, Washington Mutual began using the official abbreviation of WaMu in all but legal situations.
Acquisitions[edit]

After the acquisition of Murphey Favre, WaMu made numerous acquisitions with the aim of expanding the corporation. By acquiring companies including PNC Mortgage, Fleet Mortgage and Homeside Lending, WaMu became the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. With the acquisition of Providian Financial Corporation in October 2005, WaMu became the nation's 9th-largest credit-card company.
A partial list of Washington Mutual acquisitions since demutualization:[30]

Commercial Capital Bancorp, California, 2006
Providian Financial Corporation, California, 2005
HomeSide Lending, Inc., Florida, a unit of National Australia Bank, 2002
Fleet Mortgage Corp., South Carolina, 2001
PNC Mortgage, Illinois, 2001
Alta Residential Mortgage Trust, California, 2000
Long Beach Financial Corp., California, 1999


Many of Washington Mutual's acquisitions became reviled as the rapid post-merger integrations resulted in numerous errors. The purchase of the original PNC Mortgage came at a time when subprime lending was in a "boom" period, with PNC Financial Services believing that the market was too volatile.[31] (PNC later re-entered the mortgage market in 2009 through its acquisition of National City Corp., with no plans to re-enter subprime lending.) The Dime merger resulted in account ownership to be split with account beneficiaries. The Fleet Mortgage merger resulted in entire loans simply disappearing — being serviced, but unable to be found by customer service representatives.[citation needed]
Expansion in Washington[edit]
In April 1983, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of three branch offices from the Tacoma-based United Mutual Savings Bank for $3.25 million.[32]

In August 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Lynnwood-based Pioneer Savings Bank for $181 million in stock.[60][61][62] The acquisition by was completed in March 1993.[63]
 In October 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Pacific First Financial Corporation with its Pacific First Bank subsidiary for $663 million from its Canada-based parent Royal Trustco. The acquisition was contingent on having Pacific First dispose of its branch offices in California and having its Canadian parent Royal Trustco assume all of Pacific First's bad loans.[64][65][66] The acquisition by was completed in April 1993.[67] At the time of the initial announcement in October 1992, Washington Mutual had 118 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Pacific First had 127 branch offices in Washington, Oregon and California.

Unlike the previous acquisition targets, Enterprise held a commercial bank charter and not a thrift charter.
Expansion in Oregon[edit]
In April 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the 25 offices in the Portland, Oregon / Vancouver, Washington area from the ailing New York-based CrossLand Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Brooklyn Bancorp, for an undisclosed amount.[73] The acquisition by was completed in November 1991.[52] Seven of the 25 offices were located in Washington with the remainder in Oregon. As part of the transaction, CrossLand Savings closed seven offices in Oregon and three offices in Washington, leaving eleven offices in Oregon and four in Washington.[52] CrossLand had previously entered Oregon (and three other states) through the relatively recent acquisition of the troubled Utah-based Western Savings and Loan Association.[74][75][76] The CrossLand acquisition gave Washington Mutual a toe hold entry into Oregon via Portland.
As a result of the Pacific First acquisition in April 1993, Washington Mutual became the fourth largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits within the state of Oregon.[66] Originally, Pacific First grew quickly in Oregon during the late 1980s through the acquisition of troubled savings and loans.[77][78] By February 1991, Pacific First had 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift.[79] Pacific First had 71 branches in Oregon by July 1992.[80]

In October 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Coos Bay-based Western Bank for $156 million in stock.[82][83][84][85] The acquisition by was completed in February 1996.[86] Since Western Bank possessed a commercial bank charter and not a more restrictive savings & loan charter, Washington Mutual decided to allow Western Bank to keep its charter and name and to remain semi-autonomous for a while. At the time of the acquisition, Western Bank had 41 offices throughout Oregon. Five years later, Washington Mutual decided to abandon the Western Bank brand and integrate most of the former Western Bank offices into the existing Washington Mutual network in Oregon in 2001.[87][88] Due to branch overlaps between the two brands, 12 Western Bank branch offices and one Washington Mutual branch office were sold to the Klamath Falls-based Klamath First Bancorp for $33 million.[89][90]
Expansion in Idaho[edit]
In March 1994, Washington Mutual announced that they were planning to expand into the state of Idaho by building new branch offices inside Fred Meyer supermarket stores with the first three being opened in the Boise-area in July and August.[91][92][93][94]
In the following year, Washington Mutual opened a fourth Idaho location in a Moscow supermarket in February 1995.[95]
A branch office in Idaho Falls was acquired from the Utah-based United Savings Bank when Washington Mutual purchased the savings bank in January 1997.[96]
By March 2000, there were 9 locations within Idaho[97] and later 22 locations in 2008 when Chase acquired Washington Mutual.[98]
Expansion in Utah[edit]
In July 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank, FSB, subsidiary for $52.1 million in stock.[99][100] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 250 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Olympus had eight branch offices in Utah and two in Montana. The acquisition by was completed in May 1995.[101]

The acquisition by was completed in January 1997.[96]
Expansion in Montana[edit]
In May 1995, Washington Mutual acquired two branch offices in Butte as the result of the acquisition of the Utah-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank FSB subsidiary. Four years later, Washington Mutual later sold the two offices to Glacier Bancorp in 1999 for an undisclosed amount and quietly left the state of Montana.[109][110]
Expansion in California[edit]
 In July 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Fort Worth, Texas-based Keystone Holdings Inc. with its Irvine-based American Savings Bank subsidiary for $1.6 billion in stock.[111][112][113][114][115][116] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 317 branch offices in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana while American Savings Bank had 220 branch offices in California.[115] The acquisition by was completed in December 1996.[117][118][119][120] American kept its name after the acquisition. The result of the acquisition nearly doubled the total deposits of all Washington Mutual subsidiaries from $22 billion to $42 billion.
In February 1997, the Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial, the holding company for second largest thrift in the nation Great Western Bank, found itself the target of a hostile takeover attempt of arch-rival H. F. Ahmanson & Co., the holding company for the largest thrift in the nation Home Savings of America, that would have involved $5.8 billion worth of stock. Since the two companies had large overlapping territories, many Great Western offices would have been closed by the victor if the takeover attempt had succeeded.[121][122][123] The only way the combat a hostile takeover was to find another company, called a white knight that would allow a merger on much better terms. One such company was Washington Mutual. In March, Great Western Financial announced that it had accepted Washington Mutual's merger proposal for $6.6 billion in Washington Mutual stock.[124][125][126] Ahmanson quickly increased their bids[127] but the bids were also rejected.[128] Great Western approved the merger with Washington Mutual in June[129] and the merger was completed in July.[130][131] As part of its merger agreement, it was originally announced that Great Western offices would be allowed to keep the Great Western name and there were later discussion of converting the American Savings offices to the Great Western brand. In the end, it was felt that it was best for the company to have only one brand throughout the nation instead of multiple regional brands so it was announce in December 1997 that both Great Western and American names would be retired in favor of the Washington Mutual name.[132] The previous month, it was announced in November that 85 redundant branch offices were identified in California and were to be closed within the following year.[133][134] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 413 branch operating under various names across the country while Great Western had 416 branch offices operating in California and Florida.[135]
In March 1998, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irwindale-based H. F. Ahmanson & Company with its Home Savings of America subsidiary for approximately $10 billion in stock.[136][137][138] The acquisition by was completed in October 1998 for only $6.9 billion in stock.[139] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 892 branch operating under various names (Washington Mutual, American Savings, Great Western, etc.) across the country while Home Savings had 409 branch offices operating in California and Texas.[140][141] A few days after the completion of the merger, Washington Mutual announces plans to close 161 branch offices in California.[142][143]
Expansion in Texas[edit]
Through the 1998 acquisition of Home Savings, Washington Mutual had gained 48 branch offices in Texas.
In August 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Houston-based Bank United Corporation with its 155 branch offices, all located in Texas, for $1.49 billion in stock.[144][145][146] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[147][148]
As a result of branch overlap between Bank United and Washington Mutual, 17 branch offices were closed in Texas, 10 of which were in Houston.[149] [150]
Expansion in New York[edit]
In June 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the New York City-based Dime Bancorp with its Dime Savings Bank subsidiary for $5.2 billion in cash and stock.[151][152] The acquisition by was completed in January 2002.[153] Dime had 123 branch offices in the New York City area of both New York and New Jersey.[154]
Commercial banking[edit]
With a thrift charter, there were a few things that Washington Mutual was not able to do until it was able to obtain a commercial bank charter, such as making commercial loans above a certain size. To get around this problem, Washington Mutual began to purchase commercial banks and maintain them as separate business entities. In August 1995, Washington Mutual acquired the one office Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank in Washington. A few months later, Washington Mutual acquired the 41 office Coos Bay-based Western Bank in Oregon.[86] By 2007, Enterprise was merged into Western and operated as branch of Western.[155]
After Washington Mutual expanded into California through the acquisitions of American Savings, Great Western, and Home Savings, Washington Mutual quietly acquired the one-office Industrial Bank in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles an undisclosed amount in 1999[156][157] and renamed it WM Business Bank.[156]
By 2001, Washington Mutual had 38 specialized business banking centers operating under the Western Bank name in the Northwest and the WM Business Bank name in California when they decided to exit the commercial banking market that was then dominated with the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America.[87]
Mortgage banking[edit]
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Washington Mutual decided to aggressively expand in the subprime mortgage lending field through the acquisition of existing mortgage companies at a time when other financial institutions were leaving.
In May 1999, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Orange, California-based Long Beach Financial Corporation with its Long Beach Mortgage Company subsidiary for $350.4 million in cash and stock.[158][159] The acquisition by was completed in October 1999.[160] Long Beach had specialized in providing subprime mortgages. Some of Long Beach's questionable business practices may have led to Washington Mutual's failure in 2008.[161]
In January 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Los Angeles-based Alta Residential Mortgage Trust for $23 million.[162]
In October 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based PNC Mortgage Corporation and PNC Mortgage Securities Corporation from the PNC Financial Services Group for $605 million in cash.[163][164] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[165] The result of the PNC Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's third-largest lender.
In April 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Columbia, South Carolina-based Fleet Mortgage Corporation from FleetBoston Financial for $660 million in cash.[166] The acquisition by was completed in June 2001.[167] The result of the Fleet Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's second-largest mortgage-servicing business.
In December 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Jacksonville, Florida-based HomeSide Lending, Inc. from the National Australia Bank for $1.9 billion. The agreement did not include the mortgage servicing rights and related financial hedges for the business.[168][169] The acquisition by was completed in March 2002.[170] In August 2002, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the rest of HomeSide that included the mortgage servicing rights on a mortgage portfolio worth about $131 billion for $1.3 billion in cash and the assumption of $735 million in debt.[171] The acquisition by was completed in October 2002.[172]
In July 2002, the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Capital Corporation announced the pending sale of the mortgage loan portfolio for its Bay View Bank subsidiary to Washington Mutual for a "slight premium to book value".[173] The sale by was completed in the following month.[174]
In April 2006, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irvine, California-based Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. with its Commercial Capital Bank FSB subsidiary for $983 million in cash.[175][176] The acquisition by was completed in October 2006.[177] Commercial Capital had specialized in loans for the multifamily and small commercial real estate lending markets and was the third largest multifamily lender in California.
Rise and fall[edit]
"Wal-Mart of Banking"[edit]
Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger had pledged in 2003: "We hope to do to this industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe's, Home Depot did to their industry. And I think if we’ve done our job, five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank."[178]
Killinger's goal was to build WaMu into the "Wal-Mart of Banking", which would cater to lower- and middle-class consumers that other banks deemed too risky. Complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing, a strategy the bank extended in big cities, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. WaMu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets. WaMu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than $10,000 for bringing in borrowers. Variable-rate loans — Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (Option ARMs) in particular — were especially attractive, because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed WaMu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred. As WaMu was selling many of its loans to investors, it worried less about defaults.[9][178]
Subprime losses[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower (center right) in downtown Seattle was Washington Mutual's corporate headquarters from 1988 until 2006, when the company moved into the new WaMu Center (center left). These buildings have since been renamed; Washington Mutual Tower is now known as 1201 Third Avenue and WaMu Center is now known as Russell Investments Center.


In December 2007, the subsidiary Washington Mutual Bank reorganized its home-loan division, closing 160 of its 336 home-loan offices and removing 2,600 positions in its home-loan staff (a 22% reduction).[179]
In March 2008, on the same weekend that JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon negotiated the takeover of Bear Stearns, he secretly dispatched members of his team to Seattle to meet with WaMu executives, urging them to consider a quick deal. However, WaMu Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger rejected JPMorgan Chase's offer that valued WaMu at $8 a share, mostly in stock.[9][178]
In April 2008, the holding company, responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis, announced that 3,000 people companywide would lose their jobs, and the company stated its intent to close its approximately 176 remaining stand-alone, home-loan offices, including 23 in Washington and a loan-processing center in Bellevue, Washington. It stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as "wholesale lending." WaMu also announced a $7 billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by TPG Capital. TPG agreed to pump $2 billion into the Washington Mutual holding company; other investors, including some of WaMu's current institutional holders, agreed to buy an additional $5 billion in newly issued stock. This angered many investors, as TPG's investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, and as WaMu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses.[180]
In June 2008, Kerry Killinger stepped down as the Chairman, though remaining the Chief Executive Officer.[181] On September 8, 2008, under pressure from investors, the Washington Mutual holding company's board of directors dismissed Killinger as the CEO. Alan H. Fishman, chairman of mortgage broker Meridian Capital Group, and a former chief operating officer of Sovereign Bank, was named the new CEO for 17 days.[182]
Seizure by OTS and FDIC[edit]
By mid-September 2008, WaMu's share price had closed as low as $2.00. It had been worth over $30.00 in September 2007, and had briefly traded as high as $45 in the previous year.[183] While WaMu publicly insisted it could stay independent, earlier in the month it had quietly hired Goldman Sachs to identify potential bidders. However, several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid.[16] At the same time, WaMu suffered a massive run (mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfer[citation needed]); customers pulled out $16.7 billion in deposits in a ten-day span.[184]
This led the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to step up pressure for WaMu to find a buyer, as a takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could have been a severe drain on the FDIC insurance fund, which had already been hard hit by the failure of IndyMac that year. The FDIC ultimately held a secret auction of Washington Mutual Bank. Finally, on the morning of Thursday, September 25 (which happened to be the 119th anniversary of WaMu's establishment), regulators informed JPMorgan Chase that they were the winners.[16]
On Thursday night (shortly after the close of business on the West Coast), the Office of Thrift Supervision seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC. In a statement, the OTS said that the massive run meant that WaMu was no longer sound.[184] The FDIC, as receiver, sold most of Washington Mutual Bank's assets, including the branch network, to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. JPMorgan agreed to assume the bank's secured debts and liabilities to depositors. The transaction did not require any FDIC insurance funds.[185] Normally, bank seizures take place after the close of business on Fridays. However, due to the bank's deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent, regulators felt compelled to act a day early.[16]
Because JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual's assets for a low price, WaMu's stockholders were nearly wiped out. Its stock price dropped to $0.16 a share, far from $45 a share in 2007.[183] In its Chapter 11 filing, WaMu listed assets of $33 billion and debt of $8 billion. (ref. Appendix A). The filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors.
Within days of the seizure, a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist, Mike Stathis of AVA Investment Analytics, issued a formal complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, demonstrating evidence of insider trading. The complaint also alleged that Washington Mutual was not insolvent, and several Wall Street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock. He also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press who told him that he was contacted by a Washington Mutual executive hours before the seizure, telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons.” In later criticisms, Stathis discussed that neither the FDIC nor OTS ever disclosed any evidence of Washington Mutual's insolvency.[186] Stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint, he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning. As a result of this, Stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the SEC complaint into the public domain until a year later.[187][188]
Shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of Washington Mutual through such websites as WaMuCoup.com (dead link) and others, claiming that the OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of JPMorgan Chase, which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price. Shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover, the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the OTS 2 weeks earlier[189] and that the holding company's board and management was kept completely in the dark about the government's negotiations with Chase, hampering the bank's ability to sell itself on its own. Chief executive Alan H. Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed, and eventually received a $7.5 million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6 million (which he declined) after being CEO for 17 days.[190] Senator Maria Cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation[191] and Washington Mutual's former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares.[189]
The seizure of WaMu Bank resulted in the largest bank failure in American financial history, far exceeding the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984.[16][192][193]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc., and its remaining subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[194] Washington Mutual, Inc., was promptly delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and commenced trading via Pink Sheets. The bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks, after the Lehman Brothers filing eleven days earlier; both bankruptcies far outpaced WorldCom's 2002 filing, which had held the record with just under $104 billion in assets (Washington Mutual's alone, which was approximately half that of Lehman Brothers, was three times as much as WorldCom's).
All assets but only some liabilities (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank were assumed by JPMorgan Chase.[195] Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase acquired all the banking operations of WaMu, including $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits, for a price of $1.9 billion plus debt assumptions.[196] Unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the FDIC, leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery.[195] On Friday, Sep. 26, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank customers were informed that Deposits held by Washington Mutual became now liabilities of JPMorgan Chase.[197]
The IRS claimed $12.5 billion in back taxes from Washington Mutual, Inc.. The company filed court papers on January 22, 2009 alleging losses were $20 billion, and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt, stating that the IRS could owe Washington Mutual Inc. a tax refund.[198] In a settlement between Wash. Mutual Inc. (in receivership), the FDIC, and JPMorgan Chase that Wash. Mutual Inc. recently made public, a tax refund of about US$5.7 billion will be shared between Wash. Mutual Inc., JPMorgan Chase and FDIC.[199]
Washington Mutual, Inc., sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for US$13 billion after the sale of its banking operations to JPMorgan Chase.[200] WMI attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank, and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken.
On January 11, 2010, the United States Department of Justice, Office of the United States Trustee, District of Delaware, pursuant to Section 1102(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, appointed a Committee of Equity Security Holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock. All of the Motions to Disband the Committee of Equity Security Holders were denied on January 28, 2010 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath, District of Delaware.[201][202]
On July 20, 2010, bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath approved a motion of the EC for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of WMI, handing a victory to shareholders. The Judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase at the heart of WaMu's reorganization, but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company.[203]
On July 26, 2010, U.S. Trustee Roberta A. DeAngelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP partner Joshua R. Hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC. Hochberg is a partner in McKenna Long & Aldridge's Washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense, internal investigations and compliance.[204]
On August 10, 2010, the bankruptcy judge rejected Washington Mutual Inc.'s effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting. Attorneys for the EC said that WMI was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information. The judge agreed that WMI was not entitled to the information.[205]
On November 1, 2010, examiner Joshua R. Hochberg from McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP presented his long-awaited report, but it did not meet the expectations of the court, since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorney-client work. On December 12, the court decided to exclude the examiner's report during the plan confirmation hearings, saying it can't be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions.[206]
On January 7, 2011, the bankruptcy court rejected the 6th proposed plan of reorganization, which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Judge Mary Walrath focused many of her criticisms on the company's releases of liability granted to directors, officers and others including some hedge funds, who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement. She noted for example that shareholders, who will likely get nothing, should not have to release the company's board from the threat of being sued by them.[207] However, many WaMu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when Washington Mutual emerges from bankruptcy.
On September 14, 2011, the court also rejected the modified 6th proposed plan of reorganization. Judge Mary F. Walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt. The four hedge funds are Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management.[208]
A seventh plan of reorganization was announced in February 2012[209][210] and the company finally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month as WMI Holdings Corporation.[211] By 2015, WMI Holdings was able to raise $598 million and was looking for new acquisitions.[212]
Post receivership bank operations[edit]
During 2009, all of the Washington Mutual Bank branches that had been purchased from the FDIC after the bank had been placed into receivership, were rebranded to Chase or shuttered. All financial documents issued by WaMu were changed to carry the JPMorgan Chase logo. Credit and debit cards issued by WaMu or Providian were changed to carry the Chase logo.
Since 2009, Chase ATMs have been accessible for WaMu customers at no extra charge, and the branches and accounts were formally merged in 2009 as the WaMu brand was retired.[16] Branches in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Utah were rebranded in May 2009; branches in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Greater New York were rebranded in July 2009, and the remaining branches in Nevada, California, Arizona, and Colorado were rebranded in October 2009.[213][214] The last rebrandings formally retired the WaMu name.
In markets where Chase already had a dominant presence, such as Greater New York and Chicago owing to the presence of Chase and predecessor Bank One (in New York, the merger resulted in different branches on the same block), Chase further disposed of such branches to other banks.[215]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
"Free Checking Account"[edit]
This advertising campaign was introduced between 2005 and 2007. Numerous WaMu commercials showed traditionally-dressed 60-70-year-old overweight bankers laughing out loud at a WaMu representative (who is much younger and fitter), who says the words "Free Checking Account".
"The Power of Yes"[edit]
WaMu introduced an advertising campaign during the 2003 Academy Awards known as “The Power of Yes”. This was to promote the offering of loans to all consumers, particularly borrowers that the banks deemed too risky. Another commercial in the ad series showed WaMu representatives in casual clothes, contrasting with traditionally-dressed bankers in suits.
"Whoo hoo"[edit]




A promotional Washington Mutual "Whoo hoo!" bumper sticker.


"Whoo hoo!" was an advertising campaign introduced by Washington Mutual in February 2008. As fears of an economic crisis were rising, and WaMu was looking to become an "iconic brand that people love", they began courting consumers with a new slogan, designed to position WaMu as a consumer-friendly institution.[216]
During its run, the Whoo hoo! ads, created by TBWA\Chiat\Day of Playa del Rey, California,[216] become widespread in web navigation.[217] After WaMu launched the new advertisement, there was double digit growth at its website[217] and the term “wamu” appeared in searches over 1,000% more between January and March than in all of 2007.[217]
Washington Mutual (before the bank's September 2008 conservatorship and sale to JPMorgan Chase) applied to register a trademark in the phrase.[218][219] Initially, the bank wanted to use "woo hoo" (without the "h" in the first word) as the slogan, but they were concerned because of the existing use of the phrase by Homer Simpson, a character in The Simpsons.[218]
Occasio branch design[edit]
Washington Mutual introduced a unique branch design known as Occasio which eliminated traditional teller windows and queuing stanchions in favor of an open, circular floor plan with a greeter or "concierge" position and tellers working from behind podiums.[220][221] The Occasio design was introduced in 2000 and patented in 2004,[222] but was phased out following the JPMorgan Chase acquisition of Washington Mutual's retail banking operations.[223]

Faster than you can say mergers and acquisitions, Washington Mutual Savings Bank added two new friends of the family. The state's third-largest financial institution, which keys its advertising off the friends of the family theme, in less than 48 hours said it was acquiring both Wenatchee-based Columbia Federal Savings Bank and north Seattle's Shoreline Savings Bank... Washington Mutual has 50 branches. Shoreline operates 15 branches, Columbia Federal has 12. An earlier agreement in which Shoreline would sell three branches to Washington Mutual was vetoed by regulators, ostensibly because it would have further weakened the ailing institution. The Columbia Federal acquisition would give Washington Mutual its first significant presence in Central Washington. It obtained a strong Eastern Washington foothold in 1985 when it acquired Spokane-based Lincoln Mutual Savings Bank.

In one of the Pacific Northwest's biggest financial transactions of its kind, Washington Mutual Savings Bank said today it won the sweepstakes to take control of Pacific First Financial Corp., parent company to Pacific First Bank. The move will make Washington Mutual the second-largest financial institution in Washington and give it a huge initial presence in Oregon. Washington Mutual said it will pay $663 million for the rival institution - both have Seattle headquarters. After the deal is done next May or June, Washington Mutual will be second in size here only to Seafirst Bank. Just three years ago, then publicly held Pacific First was acquired by Royal Trustco of Toronto, Canada, for $212 million. But since then, Royal Trustco has run into problems elsewhere, and decided to abandon its strategy to string branches along the West Coast of the United States. It put Pacific First up for bid.

^ a b c Virgin, Bill (October 28, 1992). "Washington Mutual Plans to Buy Pacific First Bank". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. p. B5. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Savings Bank will buy Pacific First Bank in a deal that cements its position as one of the three leading financial institutions in the Pacific Northwest. It also brings to a somewhat messy and expensive end a foray into the American banking market by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, parent of Pacific First. While Royal Trustco is giving up its dream of building an American banking empire anchored in Seattle, it will be stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate loans that are in default or heading that way. And the $663 million acquisition of Pacific First Financial Corp. marks the third major upheaval of banking in Washington in a year, which will mean more sign changes, building closures and potential layoffs for employees. Washington Mutual already has $8.4 billion in assets and 118 branches and 17 loan centers in Washington and Oregon. Pacific First has assets of $6.9 billion, 127 branches in Washington, Oregon and California and eight mortgage offices. It previously agreed to trade its 10 California branches for Great Western Bank's 14 Washington branches. Once the Pacific First deal is completed, Washington Mutual will have assets of about $14 billion... Pacific First is merely the latest in a series of acquisitions Washington Mutual has made in the last few years, including Pioneer Savings in Lynnwood, Great Northwest in Bremerton and VanFed in Vancouver. With Pacific First's branches, Washington Mutual's share of consumer deposits in Washington will be 17.2 percent, ahead of KeyCorp-Puget Sound with 10.3 percent and trailing only Seafirst at 20.4 percent, Tejera said. In Oregon, Washington Mutual will become the fourth biggest in consumer deposits.

Pacific First Bank, a Seattle-based thrift, has quietly become the largest holder of deposits among all thrifts operating in Oregon. It also operates 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift. Its rise has been due, in part, to turmoil in the thrift industry that has led to deposit declines at competitors and the shift of one large thrift to a bank. Pacific First had $1.1 billion in deposits at its Oregon branches at the end of 1989. A year later, deposits had grown to $2.3 billion. It now holds about 27 percent of the thrift market in Oregon and about 9 percent of the combined thrift and bank market. The next-largest Oregon thrift is Far West Federal Bank with $1.3 billion in deposits... Pacific First has been serving Oregonians since 1936, but it had only a few branches until December 1988, when it bought 17 branches of Salem-based American Home Savings. One year later the thrift was acquired by Toronto, Canada-based Royal Trustco, Canada's largest trust company, which injected $100 million of capital into the thrift and set it on an aggressive expansion course. Pacific First acquired the 45 branches of Willamette Savings and Loan in June and added the 12 Oregon branches of the Williamsburg Federal Savings and Loan Association in September. Some recently acquired branches have been closed, leaving the thrift with 78 Oregon branches spread throughout the state, but principally in the Portland metropolitan area and the Willamette Valley.

In an acquisition that will virtually double the size of the savings bank the day it is completed, Seattle-based Washington Mutual said it will acquire Keystone Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary, American Savings Bank of Irvine, Calif., in a stock deal worth about $1.4 billion, based on yesterday's closing price... In addition, because American's loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward adjustable rate mortgages, the acquisition helps Washington Mutual reduce its vulnerability to interest rate swings... The third attraction for investors is the presence of billionaire investor Robert Bass, who bought into American Savings when it was taken over by the government and reorganized in 1988. He assures me he has totally bought into the business plan. We believe he will be a good long-term shareholder, Killinger said of Bass. Bass will name two additional members to Washington Mutual's board, although Killinger said it's not likely Bass himself will serve... Washington Mutual, already at $22 million in assets, will grow to more than $42 million. It already operates 248 branches in Washington, Oregon, Utah, Idaho and Montana. American Savings will add 158 branches in California... A new shareholder in Washington Mutual will be the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which as part of the bailout of American holds about a third of the company. The FDIC is expected to sell those shares. 
^ a b Adamson, Deborah (July 23, 1996). "American Savings Merging - Washington Mutual to Strengthen Coastal Presence With Deal". Los Angeles Daily News. p. B1. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Inc., a Seattle financial services firm, said Monday it will buy American Savings Bank and its parent company in a stock for stock transaction worth $3.5 billion. Irvine-based American Savings Bank will keep its name, and officials said they expect all branches to remain open, officials said... Washington Mutual, which owns a network of banks, is the No. 1 residential mortgage originator in Washington and Oregon. American Savings is California's second largest home-mortgage originator. The deal gives Washington Mutual its first presence in California, allowing an immediate foothold in key locations that will solidify its West Coast position... Robert M. Bass and his investor group control Keystone Holdings Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, the parent company of American Savings. After the acquisition, Keystone will be merged into Washington Mutual. The investor group will get 26 million of the 48 million shares to be issued by Washington Mutual in the merger. With total outstanding shares of 117.5 million, the group's share amounts to a 22 percent ownership in the new company, with Bass holding an 8 percent stake. About 14 million of the new shares will go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will sell them after the merger. The rest will be held in escrow pending the outcome of a Keystone lawsuit against the federal government. Washington Mutual also will assume Keystone's $365 million of debt and $80 million in outstanding preferred stock. Mario Antoci, American Savings' chairman and CEO, will retire after the deal closes. Post-merger management changes have not been finalized. Antoci took over American Savings in 1988, when the Bass Group bought it. American Savings Bank was originally part of American Savings and Loan, a failed thrift that led to the largest savings and loan bailout in history. The original thrift was divided into two parts: American Savings Bank controlled the profitable assets and loans while the other unit was liquidated. American Savings Bank has 220 branches in California and Arizona. Washington Mutual has 317 branches in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana. 
^ Fuquay, Jim (July 23, 1996). "Bass group bonanza - Keystone Holdings sells a California thrift in a deal valued at $1.6 billion.". Fort Worth Star-Telegram. p. 1. (Subscription required (help)). An investment group led by Fort Worth billionaire Robert M. Bass cashed in on a $400 million investment in California's American Savings yesterday, selling the thrift it acquired less than eight years ago. The deal was valued at more than $1.6 billion. Washington Mutual Inc., the parent of one of Washington state's largest savings banks, agreed to acquire the thrift for at least 40 million shares of Washington Mutual stock. That stock was worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at Friday's closing price. Washington Mutual will also assume $465 million in debt as part of the deal... Bass made his investment through Keystone Holdings, in which he owns about 36 percent. In 1988, Keystone acquired American Savings from the federal government, which had seized the thrift in 1984. Keystone invested $350 million in cash into American Savings and spent another $50 million in expenses to buy the institution, which at the time was America's biggest insolvent thrift. Keystone installed Mario J. Antoci, a respected thrift executive, to run American Savings. The thrift, stripped of its most troubled assets, immediately started making money... The Keystone group will also name two members of Washington Mutual's 13-person board, suggesting that the group is likely to retain its interest in the company.

Hoping to marry the nation's two largest savings and loans into a financial powerhouse, the corporate parent of Home Savings of America has offered to buy Great Western Financial Corp. in a deal valued at nearly $6 billion, sources close to the proposed transaction said late Monday. The unsolicited offer by Irwindale-based H.F. Ahmanson & Co. would form the third-largest financial institution in California--after giant Bank of America and Wells Fargo. It would also result in the closure of more than 100 bank branches and the probable loss of hundreds of jobs, sources said.

Ahmanson and Co.'s $6.2 billion takeover bid yesterday as its bankers met with potential rival suitors, sources close to Great Western said... Sources said possible bidders that Great Western may have contacted include First Bank System Inc., Washington Mutual Savings Bank and Norwest Corp. Local banking executives and analysts said Washington Mutual is likely to take a close look at a deal for Great Western, and said there are equally strong reasons why the Seattle-based thrift might bid or walk away. On the negative side, Washington Mutual is currently digesting a major California acquisition, a hurry-up deal wouldn't give it time to carefully review the transaction, it wouldn't get the same cost savings Ahmanson would to make the deal attractive, and a bidding war could become expensive.

Texas was something of an incidental market Washington Mutual picked up in its 1998 acquisition of H.F.

The deal, valued at $1.5 billion and expected to close by year's end, will greatly increase Washington Mutual's presence in the state. The Seattle-based institution entered Texas in 1998 with its acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson & Co., parent of Savings of America, and the Bank United merger will give it 3 percent of Texas deposits, according to June 30, 1999, reports, the latest available. Washington Mutual, which ranks No. 8 among all U.S. banks and thrifts, also has a previous Texas connection. In 1995, it acquired American Savings, a California thrift owned by Fort Worth investor Robert M. Bass, who became a major Washington Mutual shareholder as a result of that deal. A Bass lieutenant, Jay Crandall, remains on Washington Mutual's board of directors... Bank United has 155 retail branches in the state, including 77 in North Texas, along with 42 commercial loan offices and 11 other sales offices. Washington Mutual has 48 branches in Texas, including two in Tarrant County... About a dozen Texas branches share overlapping market areas, the companies said.

Washington Mutual, Inc., abbreviated to WaMu, was a savings bank holding company and the former owner of Washington Mutual Bank, which was the United States' largest savings and loan association until its collapse in 2008.[5][6][7][8][9]
On Thursday, September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) seized Washington Mutual Bank from Washington Mutual, Inc. and placed it into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The OTS took the action due to the withdrawal of $16.7 billion in deposits during a 9-day bank run (amounting to 9% of the deposits it had held on June 30, 2008).[10] The FDIC sold the banking subsidiaries (minus unsecured debt and equity claims) to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion, which JPMorgan Chase had been planning to acquire as part of a confidential plan internally nicknamed Project West.[11][12][13] All WaMu branches were rebranded as Chase branches by the end of 2009. The holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc., was left with $33 billion in assets, and $8 billion debt, after being stripped of its banking subsidiary by the FDIC.[6][7][14][15] The next day, September 26, Washington Mutual, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 voluntary bankruptcy in Delaware, where it was incorporated.[7][14]
With respect to total assets under management, Washington Mutual Bank's closure and receivership is the largest bank failure in American financial history.[6][7] Before the receivership action, it was the sixth-largest bank in the United States.[16] According to Washington Mutual Inc.'s 2007 SEC filing, the holding company held assets valued at $327.9 billion.[17]
On March 20, 2009, Washington Mutual Inc. filed suit against the FDIC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking damages of approximately $13 billion for what it claims was an unjustified seizure and an extremely low sale price to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase promptly filed a counterclaim in the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, where the Washington Mutual bankruptcy proceedings had been continuing since the Office of Thrift Supervision's seizure of the holding company's bank subsidiaries.[18][19]

Business operations prior to bank receivership[edit]




A former WaMu branch in the Chinatown section of New York City (2004)


Despite its name, Washington Mutual ceased being a mutual company in 1983 when it demutualized and became a public company on March 11.
On June 30, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank had total assets of US$307 billion, with 2,239 retail branch offices operating in 15 states, with 4,932 ATMs, and 43,198 employees. It held liabilities in the form of deposits of $188.3 billion, and owed $82.9 billion to the Federal Home Loan Bank, and had subordinated debt of $7.8 billion. It held as assets of $118.9 billion in single-family loans, of which $52.9 billion were "option adjustable rate mortgages" (Option ARMs), with $16 billion in subprime mortgage loans, and $53.4 billion of Home Equity lines of Credit (HELOCs) and credit cards receivables of $10.6 billion. It was servicing for itself and other banks loans totaling $689.7 billion, of which $442.7 were for other banks. It had non-performing assets of $11.6 billion, including $3.23 billion in payment option ARMs and $3.0 billion in subprime mortgage loans.[20]
On September 15, 2008, the holding company received a credit rating agency downgrade. From that date through September 24, 2008, WaMu experienced a bank run whereby customers withdrew $16.7 billion in deposits over those 9 days,[15] and in excess of $22 billion in cash outflow since July 2008, both conditions which ultimately led the Office of Thrift Supervision to close the bank.[20]
The FDIC then sold most of the bank's assets to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion in cash plus assumption of all secured debt and some unsecured debt. Claims of the subsidiary bank's equity holders, senior and subordinated debt (all primarily owned by the holding company) were not assumed by JPMorgan Chase[clarification needed].[7][21][22]
History[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower at 1201 Third Avenue in Seattle, Washington


Mutual savings bank[edit]
Washington Mutual was incorporated as the Washington National Building Loan and Investment Association on September 25, 1889, after the Great Seattle Fire destroyed 120 acres (49 ha) of the central business district of Seattle. The newly formed company made its first home mortgage loan on the West Coast on February 10, 1890. It changed its name to Washington Savings and Loan Association on June 25, 1908.[2] By September 12, 1917 it was operating under the name Washington Mutual Savings Bank.[23] The company purchased its first company, the financially distressed Continental Mutual Savings Bank, on July 25, 1930.[2] Its marketing slogan for much of its history was "The Friend of the Family".
Post demutualization growth[edit]
In April 1982, Washington Mutual purchased the brokerage firm Murphey Favre for undisclosed amount in cash[24] and demutualized the following year, converting into a capital stock savings bank.[25] Stock in the capital stock savings bank was first offered for sale on March 11, 1983.[26] By 1989, its assets had doubled.[2]
In November 1994, Washington Mutual formed a new holding called Washington Mutual, Inc. and separated its non-banking units from its primary banking unit, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, which was simultaneously renamed Washington Mutual Bank.[27][28][29] The company's stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under WAMU.
In October 2005, Washington Mutual purchased the formerly "subprime" credit card issuer Providian for approximately $6.5 billion, although Providian's new management team's strategy of targeting Prime credit card consumers had been underway since 2001, therefore the credit card unit's nonperforming loan portfolio had improved significantly prior to the company's sale to WaMu. In March 2006, Washington Mutual began the move into its new headquarters, WaMu Center, located in downtown Seattle. The company's previous headquarters, Washington Mutual Tower, stands about a block away from the new building on Second Avenue. In August 2006, Washington Mutual began using the official abbreviation of WaMu in all but legal situations.
Acquisitions[edit]

After the acquisition of Murphey Favre, WaMu made numerous acquisitions with the aim of expanding the corporation. By acquiring companies including PNC Mortgage, Fleet Mortgage and Homeside Lending, WaMu became the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. With the acquisition of Providian Financial Corporation in October 2005, WaMu became the nation's 9th-largest credit-card company.
A partial list of Washington Mutual acquisitions since demutualization:[30]

Commercial Capital Bancorp, California, 2006
Providian Financial Corporation, California, 2005
HomeSide Lending, Inc., Florida, a unit of National Australia Bank, 2002
Fleet Mortgage Corp., South Carolina, 2001
PNC Mortgage, Illinois, 2001
Alta Residential Mortgage Trust, California, 2000
Long Beach Financial Corp., California, 1999


Many of Washington Mutual's acquisitions became reviled as the rapid post-merger integrations resulted in numerous errors. The purchase of the original PNC Mortgage came at a time when subprime lending was in a "boom" period, with PNC Financial Services believing that the market was too volatile.[31] (PNC later re-entered the mortgage market in 2009 through its acquisition of National City Corp., with no plans to re-enter subprime lending.) The Dime merger resulted in account ownership to be split with account beneficiaries. The Fleet Mortgage merger resulted in entire loans simply disappearing — being serviced, but unable to be found by customer service representatives.[citation needed]
Expansion in Washington[edit]
In April 1983, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of three branch offices from the Tacoma-based United Mutual Savings Bank for $3.25 million.[32]

In January 1990, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of all seven offices of the Seattle-based Old Stone Bank of Washington from the Rhode Island-based Old Stone Corporation for an undisclosed amount.[39][40][41] Old Stone originally entered the state of Washington through the acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association in 1985 with the assistance of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.[42][43][44] The acquisition by Washington Mutual was completed in June 1990 for $10 million.[45][46]

The acquisition of the Pacific Northwest branch offices from the New York-based CrossLand Savings Bank that was announced in April 1991 and completed in November 1991 gave Washington Mutual four offices within the state of Washington in addition to other offices located in the state of Oregon.[52]
In August 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Seattle-based Sound Savings and Loan Association for an undisclosed amount.[53] At the time of the announcement in August 1991, Washington Mutual had 84 branch offices, all within Washington state.[53] The acquisition by was completed in January 1992.[54]

In December 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of both Washington state branch offices of the California-based World Savings and Loan Association of America, a subsidiary of Golden West Financial, for an undisclosed amount.[58] The acquisition by was completed in March 1992.[59]
In August 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Lynnwood-based Pioneer Savings Bank for $181 million in stock.[60][61][62] The acquisition by was completed in March 1993.[63]
 In October 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Pacific First Financial Corporation with its Pacific First Bank subsidiary for $663 million from its Canada-based parent Royal Trustco. The acquisition was contingent on having Pacific First dispose of its branch offices in California and having its Canadian parent Royal Trustco assume all of Pacific First's bad loans.[64][65][66] The acquisition by was completed in April 1993.[67] At the time of the initial announcement in October 1992, Washington Mutual had 118 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Pacific First had 127 branch offices in Washington, Oregon and California. Pacific First had previously announced that it was trading its California offices for Great Western's Washington offices. As a result of the Pacific First acquisition, Washington Mutual became one of the largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits in the state of Washington, second only to Seafirst.[66]
In June 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Summit Bancorp with its Summit Savings Bank subsidiary for $25 million in stock.[68] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 231 branch offices in Washington and Oregon. The acquisition by was completed in November 1994.[69]
In June 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank for $26.8 million in stock.[70][71][72] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 260 branch offices. Unlike the previous acquisition targets, Enterprise held a commercial bank charter and not a thrift charter.
Expansion in Oregon[edit]
In April 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the 25 offices in the Portland, Oregon / Vancouver, Washington area from the ailing New York-based CrossLand Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Brooklyn Bancorp, for an undisclosed amount.[73] The acquisition by was completed in November 1991.[52] Seven of the 25 offices were located in Washington with the remainder in Oregon. As part of the transaction, CrossLand Savings closed seven offices in Oregon and three offices in Washington, leaving eleven offices in Oregon and four in Washington.[52] CrossLand had previously entered Oregon (and three other states) through the relatively recent acquisition of the troubled Utah-based Western Savings and Loan Association.[74][75][76] The CrossLand acquisition gave Washington Mutual a toe hold entry into Oregon via Portland.
As a result of the Pacific First acquisition in April 1993, Washington Mutual became the fourth largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits within the state of Oregon.[66] Originally, Pacific First grew quickly in Oregon during the late 1980s through the acquisition of troubled savings and loans.[77][78] By February 1991, Pacific First had 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift.[79] Pacific First had 71 branches in Oregon by July 1992.[80]
In April 1994, Washington Mutual announced the completed acquisition of three Portland-area offices of the failed Portland-based Far West Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $2.2 million.[81]
In October 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Coos Bay-based Western Bank for $156 million in stock.[82][83][84][85] The acquisition by was completed in February 1996.[86] Since Western Bank possessed a commercial bank charter and not a more restrictive savings & loan charter, Washington Mutual decided to allow Western Bank to keep its charter and name and to remain semi-autonomous for a while. At the time of the acquisition, Western Bank had 41 offices throughout Oregon. Five years later, Washington Mutual decided to abandon the Western Bank brand and integrate most of the former Western Bank offices into the existing Washington Mutual network in Oregon in 2001.[87][88] Due to branch overlaps between the two brands, 12 Western Bank branch offices and one Washington Mutual branch office were sold to the Klamath Falls-based Klamath First Bancorp for $33 million.[89][90]
Expansion in Idaho[edit]
In March 1994, Washington Mutual announced that they were planning to expand into the state of Idaho by building new branch offices inside Fred Meyer supermarket stores with the first three being opened in the Boise-area in July and August.[91][92][93][94]
In the following year, Washington Mutual opened a fourth Idaho location in a Moscow supermarket in February 1995.[95]
A branch office in Idaho Falls was acquired from the Utah-based United Savings Bank when Washington Mutual purchased the savings bank in January 1997.[96]
By March 2000, there were 9 locations within Idaho[97] and later 22 locations in 2008 when Chase acquired Washington Mutual.[98]
Expansion in Utah[edit]
In July 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank, FSB, subsidiary for $52.1 million in stock.[99][100] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 250 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Olympus had eight branch offices in Utah and two in Montana. The acquisition by was completed in May 1995.[101]
In March 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Ogden-based Utah Federal Savings Bank for an undisclosed amount.[102][103] At the time of the announcement, Utah Federal had five branch offices while Washington Mutual had 16 within Utah. The acquisition by was completed in December 1996 for $15.2 million.[104]
In September 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based United Western Financial Group Inc. with its United Savings Bank subsidiary for $80.3 million in cash.[105][106][107][108] At the time of the announcement, United Savings Bank had eight branch offices in Utah and one in Idaho. The acquisition by was completed in January 1997.[96]
Expansion in Montana[edit]
In May 1995, Washington Mutual acquired two branch offices in Butte as the result of the acquisition of the Utah-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank FSB subsidiary. Four years later, Washington Mutual later sold the two offices to Glacier Bancorp in 1999 for an undisclosed amount and quietly left the state of Montana.[109][110]
Expansion in California[edit]
 In July 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Fort Worth, Texas-based Keystone Holdings Inc. with its Irvine-based American Savings Bank subsidiary for $1.6 billion in stock.[111][112][113][114][115][116] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 317 branch offices in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana while American Savings Bank had 220 branch offices in California.[115] The acquisition by was completed in December 1996.[117][118][119][120] American kept its name after the acquisition. The result of the acquisition nearly doubled the total deposits of all Washington Mutual subsidiaries from $22 billion to $42 billion.
In February 1997, the Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial, the holding company for second largest thrift in the nation Great Western Bank, found itself the target of a hostile takeover attempt of arch-rival H. F. Ahmanson & Co., the holding company for the largest thrift in the nation Home Savings of America, that would have involved $5.8 billion worth of stock. Since the two companies had large overlapping territories, many Great Western offices would have been closed by the victor if the takeover attempt had succeeded.[121][122][123] The only way the combat a hostile takeover was to find another company, called a white knight that would allow a merger on much better terms. One such company was Washington Mutual. In March, Great Western Financial announced that it had accepted Washington Mutual's merger proposal for $6.6 billion in Washington Mutual stock.[124][125][126] Ahmanson quickly increased their bids[127] but the bids were also rejected.[128] Great Western approved the merger with Washington Mutual in June[129] and the merger was completed in July.[130][131] As part of its merger agreement, it was originally announced that Great Western offices would be allowed to keep the Great Western name and there were later discussion of converting the American Savings offices to the Great Western brand. In the end, it was felt that it was best for the company to have only one brand throughout the nation instead of multiple regional brands so it was announce in December 1997 that both Great Western and American names would be retired in favor of the Washington Mutual name.[132] The previous month, it was announced in November that 85 redundant branch offices were identified in California and were to be closed within the following year.[133][134] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 413 branch operating under various names across the country while Great Western had 416 branch offices operating in California and Florida.[135]
In March 1998, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irwindale-based H. F. Ahmanson & Company with its Home Savings of America subsidiary for approximately $10 billion in stock.[136][137][138] The acquisition by was completed in October 1998 for only $6.9 billion in stock.[139] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 892 branch operating under various names (Washington Mutual, American Savings, Great Western, etc.) across the country while Home Savings had 409 branch offices operating in California and Texas.[140][141] A few days after the completion of the merger, Washington Mutual announces plans to close 161 branch offices in California.[142][143]
Expansion in Texas[edit]
Through the 1998 acquisition of Home Savings, Washington Mutual had gained 48 branch offices in Texas.
In August 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Houston-based Bank United Corporation with its 155 branch offices, all located in Texas, for $1.49 billion in stock.[144][145][146] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[147][148]
As a result of branch overlap between Bank United and Washington Mutual, 17 branch offices were closed in Texas, 10 of which were in Houston.[149] [150]
Expansion in New York[edit]
In June 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the New York City-based Dime Bancorp with its Dime Savings Bank subsidiary for $5.2 billion in cash and stock.[151][152] The acquisition by was completed in January 2002.[153] Dime had 123 branch offices in the New York City area of both New York and New Jersey.[154]
Commercial banking[edit]
With a thrift charter, there were a few things that Washington Mutual was not able to do until it was able to obtain a commercial bank charter, such as making commercial loans above a certain size. To get around this problem, Washington Mutual began to purchase commercial banks and maintain them as separate business entities. In August 1995, Washington Mutual acquired the one office Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank in Washington. A few months later, Washington Mutual acquired the 41 office Coos Bay-based Western Bank in Oregon.[86] By 2007, Enterprise was merged into Western and operated as branch of Western.[155]
After Washington Mutual expanded into California through the acquisitions of American Savings, Great Western, and Home Savings, Washington Mutual quietly acquired the one-office Industrial Bank in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles an undisclosed amount in 1999[156][157] and renamed it WM Business Bank.[156]
By 2001, Washington Mutual had 38 specialized business banking centers operating under the Western Bank name in the Northwest and the WM Business Bank name in California when they decided to exit the commercial banking market that was then dominated with the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America.[87]
Mortgage banking[edit]
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Washington Mutual decided to aggressively expand in the subprime mortgage lending field through the acquisition of existing mortgage companies at a time when other financial institutions were leaving.
In May 1999, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Orange, California-based Long Beach Financial Corporation with its Long Beach Mortgage Company subsidiary for $350.4 million in cash and stock.[158][159] The acquisition by was completed in October 1999.[160] Long Beach had specialized in providing subprime mortgages. Some of Long Beach's questionable business practices may have led to Washington Mutual's failure in 2008.[161]
In January 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Los Angeles-based Alta Residential Mortgage Trust for $23 million.[162]
In October 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based PNC Mortgage Corporation and PNC Mortgage Securities Corporation from the PNC Financial Services Group for $605 million in cash.[163][164] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[165] The result of the PNC Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's third-largest lender.
In April 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Columbia, South Carolina-based Fleet Mortgage Corporation from FleetBoston Financial for $660 million in cash.[166] The acquisition by was completed in June 2001.[167] The result of the Fleet Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's second-largest mortgage-servicing business.
In December 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Jacksonville, Florida-based HomeSide Lending, Inc. from the National Australia Bank for $1.9 billion. The agreement did not include the mortgage servicing rights and related financial hedges for the business.[168][169] The acquisition by was completed in March 2002.[170] In August 2002, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the rest of HomeSide that included the mortgage servicing rights on a mortgage portfolio worth about $131 billion for $1.3 billion in cash and the assumption of $735 million in debt.[171] The acquisition by was completed in October 2002.[172]
In July 2002, the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Capital Corporation announced the pending sale of the mortgage loan portfolio for its Bay View Bank subsidiary to Washington Mutual for a "slight premium to book value".[173] The sale by was completed in the following month.[174]
In April 2006, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irvine, California-based Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. with its Commercial Capital Bank FSB subsidiary for $983 million in cash.[175][176] The acquisition by was completed in October 2006.[177] Commercial Capital had specialized in loans for the multifamily and small commercial real estate lending markets and was the third largest multifamily lender in California.
Rise and fall[edit]
"Wal-Mart of Banking"[edit]
Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger had pledged in 2003: "We hope to do to this industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe's, Home Depot did to their industry. And I think if we’ve done our job, five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank."[178]
Killinger's goal was to build WaMu into the "Wal-Mart of Banking", which would cater to lower- and middle-class consumers that other banks deemed too risky. Complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing, a strategy the bank extended in big cities, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. WaMu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets. WaMu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than $10,000 for bringing in borrowers. Variable-rate loans — Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (Option ARMs) in particular — were especially attractive, because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed WaMu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred. As WaMu was selling many of its loans to investors, it worried less about defaults.[9][178]
Subprime losses[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower (center right) in downtown Seattle was Washington Mutual's corporate headquarters from 1988 until 2006, when the company moved into the new WaMu Center (center left). These buildings have since been renamed; Washington Mutual Tower is now known as 1201 Third Avenue and WaMu Center is now known as Russell Investments Center.


In December 2007, the subsidiary Washington Mutual Bank reorganized its home-loan division, closing 160 of its 336 home-loan offices and removing 2,600 positions in its home-loan staff (a 22% reduction).[179]
In March 2008, on the same weekend that JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon negotiated the takeover of Bear Stearns, he secretly dispatched members of his team to Seattle to meet with WaMu executives, urging them to consider a quick deal. However, WaMu Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger rejected JPMorgan Chase's offer that valued WaMu at $8 a share, mostly in stock.[9][178]
In April 2008, the holding company, responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis, announced that 3,000 people companywide would lose their jobs, and the company stated its intent to close its approximately 176 remaining stand-alone, home-loan offices, including 23 in Washington and a loan-processing center in Bellevue, Washington. It stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as "wholesale lending." WaMu also announced a $7 billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by TPG Capital. TPG agreed to pump $2 billion into the Washington Mutual holding company; other investors, including some of WaMu's current institutional holders, agreed to buy an additional $5 billion in newly issued stock. This angered many investors, as TPG's investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, and as WaMu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses.[180]
In June 2008, Kerry Killinger stepped down as the Chairman, though remaining the Chief Executive Officer.[181] On September 8, 2008, under pressure from investors, the Washington Mutual holding company's board of directors dismissed Killinger as the CEO. Alan H. Fishman, chairman of mortgage broker Meridian Capital Group, and a former chief operating officer of Sovereign Bank, was named the new CEO for 17 days.[182]
Seizure by OTS and FDIC[edit]
By mid-September 2008, WaMu's share price had closed as low as $2.00. It had been worth over $30.00 in September 2007, and had briefly traded as high as $45 in the previous year.[183] While WaMu publicly insisted it could stay independent, earlier in the month it had quietly hired Goldman Sachs to identify potential bidders. However, several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid.[16] At the same time, WaMu suffered a massive run (mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfer[citation needed]); customers pulled out $16.7 billion in deposits in a ten-day span.[184]
This led the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to step up pressure for WaMu to find a buyer, as a takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could have been a severe drain on the FDIC insurance fund, which had already been hard hit by the failure of IndyMac that year. The FDIC ultimately held a secret auction of Washington Mutual Bank. Finally, on the morning of Thursday, September 25 (which happened to be the 119th anniversary of WaMu's establishment), regulators informed JPMorgan Chase that they were the winners.[16]
On Thursday night (shortly after the close of business on the West Coast), the Office of Thrift Supervision seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC. In a statement, the OTS said that the massive run meant that WaMu was no longer sound.[184] The FDIC, as receiver, sold most of Washington Mutual Bank's assets, including the branch network, to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. JPMorgan agreed to assume the bank's secured debts and liabilities to depositors. The transaction did not require any FDIC insurance funds.[185] Normally, bank seizures take place after the close of business on Fridays. However, due to the bank's deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent, regulators felt compelled to act a day early.[16]
Because JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual's assets for a low price, WaMu's stockholders were nearly wiped out. Its stock price dropped to $0.16 a share, far from $45 a share in 2007.[183] In its Chapter 11 filing, WaMu listed assets of $33 billion and debt of $8 billion. (ref. Appendix A). The filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors.
Within days of the seizure, a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist, Mike Stathis of AVA Investment Analytics, issued a formal complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, demonstrating evidence of insider trading. The complaint also alleged that Washington Mutual was not insolvent, and several Wall Street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock. He also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press who told him that he was contacted by a Washington Mutual executive hours before the seizure, telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons.” In later criticisms, Stathis discussed that neither the FDIC nor OTS ever disclosed any evidence of Washington Mutual's insolvency.[186] Stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint, he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning. As a result of this, Stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the SEC complaint into the public domain until a year later.[187][188]
Shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of Washington Mutual through such websites as WaMuCoup.com (dead link) and others, claiming that the OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of JPMorgan Chase, which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price. Shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover, the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the OTS 2 weeks earlier[189] and that the holding company's board and management was kept completely in the dark about the government's negotiations with Chase, hampering the bank's ability to sell itself on its own. Chief executive Alan H. Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed, and eventually received a $7.5 million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6 million (which he declined) after being CEO for 17 days.[190] Senator Maria Cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation[191] and Washington Mutual's former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares.[189]
The seizure of WaMu Bank resulted in the largest bank failure in American financial history, far exceeding the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984.[16][192][193]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc., and its remaining subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[194] Washington Mutual, Inc., was promptly delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and commenced trading via Pink Sheets. The bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks, after the Lehman Brothers filing eleven days earlier; both bankruptcies far outpaced WorldCom's 2002 filing, which had held the record with just under $104 billion in assets (Washington Mutual's alone, which was approximately half that of Lehman Brothers, was three times as much as WorldCom's).
All assets but only some liabilities (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank were assumed by JPMorgan Chase.[195] Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase acquired all the banking operations of WaMu, including $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits, for a price of $1.9 billion plus debt assumptions.[196] Unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the FDIC, leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery.[195] On Friday, Sep. 26, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank customers were informed that Deposits held by Washington Mutual became now liabilities of JPMorgan Chase.[197]
The IRS claimed $12.5 billion in back taxes from Washington Mutual, Inc.. The company filed court papers on January 22, 2009 alleging losses were $20 billion, and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt, stating that the IRS could owe Washington Mutual Inc. a tax refund.[198] In a settlement between Wash. Mutual Inc. (in receivership), the FDIC, and JPMorgan Chase that Wash. Mutual Inc. recently made public, a tax refund of about US$5.7 billion will be shared between Wash. Mutual Inc., JPMorgan Chase and FDIC.[199]
Washington Mutual, Inc., sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for US$13 billion after the sale of its banking operations to JPMorgan Chase.[200] WMI attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank, and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken.
On January 11, 2010, the United States Department of Justice, Office of the United States Trustee, District of Delaware, pursuant to Section 1102(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, appointed a Committee of Equity Security Holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock. All of the Motions to Disband the Committee of Equity Security Holders were denied on January 28, 2010 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath, District of Delaware.[201][202]
On July 20, 2010, bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath approved a motion of the EC for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of WMI, handing a victory to shareholders. The Judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase at the heart of WaMu's reorganization, but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company.[203]
On July 26, 2010, U.S. Trustee Roberta A. DeAngelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP partner Joshua R. Hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC. Hochberg is a partner in McKenna Long & Aldridge's Washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense, internal investigations and compliance.[204]
On August 10, 2010, the bankruptcy judge rejected Washington Mutual Inc.'s effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting. Attorneys for the EC said that WMI was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information. The judge agreed that WMI was not entitled to the information.[205]
On November 1, 2010, examiner Joshua R. Hochberg from McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP presented his long-awaited report, but it did not meet the expectations of the court, since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorney-client work. On December 12, the court decided to exclude the examiner's report during the plan confirmation hearings, saying it can't be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions.[206]
On January 7, 2011, the bankruptcy court rejected the 6th proposed plan of reorganization, which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Judge Mary Walrath focused many of her criticisms on the company's releases of liability granted to directors, officers and others including some hedge funds, who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement. She noted for example that shareholders, who will likely get nothing, should not have to release the company's board from the threat of being sued by them.[207] However, many WaMu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when Washington Mutual emerges from bankruptcy.
On September 14, 2011, the court also rejected the modified 6th proposed plan of reorganization. Judge Mary F. Walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt. The four hedge funds are Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management.[208]
A seventh plan of reorganization was announced in February 2012[209][210] and the company finally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month as WMI Holdings Corporation.[211] By 2015, WMI Holdings was able to raise $598 million and was looking for new acquisitions.[212]
Post receivership bank operations[edit]
During 2009, all of the Washington Mutual Bank branches that had been purchased from the FDIC after the bank had been placed into receivership, were rebranded to Chase or shuttered. All financial documents issued by WaMu were changed to carry the JPMorgan Chase logo. Credit and debit cards issued by WaMu or Providian were changed to carry the Chase logo.
Since 2009, Chase ATMs have been accessible for WaMu customers at no extra charge, and the branches and accounts were formally merged in 2009 as the WaMu brand was retired.[16] Branches in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Utah were rebranded in May 2009; branches in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Greater New York were rebranded in July 2009, and the remaining branches in Nevada, California, Arizona, and Colorado were rebranded in October 2009.[213][214] The last rebrandings formally retired the WaMu name.
In markets where Chase already had a dominant presence, such as Greater New York and Chicago owing to the presence of Chase and predecessor Bank One (in New York, the merger resulted in different branches on the same block), Chase further disposed of such branches to other banks.[215]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
"Free Checking Account"[edit]
This advertising campaign was introduced between 2005 and 2007. Numerous WaMu commercials showed traditionally-dressed 60-70-year-old overweight bankers laughing out loud at a WaMu representative (who is much younger and fitter), who says the words "Free Checking Account".
"The Power of Yes"[edit]
WaMu introduced an advertising campaign during the 2003 Academy Awards known as “The Power of Yes”. This was to promote the offering of loans to all consumers, particularly borrowers that the banks deemed too risky. Another commercial in the ad series showed WaMu representatives in casual clothes, contrasting with traditionally-dressed bankers in suits.
"Whoo hoo"[edit]




A promotional Washington Mutual "Whoo hoo!" bumper sticker.


"Whoo hoo!" was an advertising campaign introduced by Washington Mutual in February 2008. As fears of an economic crisis were rising, and WaMu was looking to become an "iconic brand that people love", they began courting consumers with a new slogan, designed to position WaMu as a consumer-friendly institution.[216]
During its run, the Whoo hoo! ads, created by TBWA\Chiat\Day of Playa del Rey, California,[216] become widespread in web navigation.[217] After WaMu launched the new advertisement, there was double digit growth at its website[217] and the term “wamu” appeared in searches over 1,000% more between January and March than in all of 2007.[217]
Washington Mutual (before the bank's September 2008 conservatorship and sale to JPMorgan Chase) applied to register a trademark in the phrase.[218][219] Initially, the bank wanted to use "woo hoo" (without the "h" in the first word) as the slogan, but they were concerned because of the existing use of the phrase by Homer Simpson, a character in The Simpsons.[218]
Occasio branch design[edit]
Washington Mutual introduced a unique branch design known as Occasio which eliminated traditional teller windows and queuing stanchions in favor of an open, circular floor plan with a greeter or "concierge" position and tellers working from behind podiums.[220][221] The Occasio design was introduced in 2000 and patented in 2004,[222] but was phased out following the JPMorgan Chase acquisition of Washington Mutual's retail banking operations.[223]

The move will make Washington Mutual the second-largest financial institution in Washington and give it a huge initial presence in Oregon. Washington Mutual said it will pay $663 million for the rival institution - both have Seattle headquarters. After the deal is done next May or June, Washington Mutual will be second in size here only to Seafirst Bank. Just three years ago, then publicly held Pacific First was acquired by Royal Trustco of Toronto, Canada, for $212 million. But since then, Royal Trustco has run into problems elsewhere, and decided to abandon its strategy to string branches along the West Coast of the United States. It put Pacific First up for bid.

Washington Mutual Savings Bank will buy Pacific First Bank in a deal that cements its position as one of the three leading financial institutions in the Pacific Northwest. It also brings to a somewhat messy and expensive end a foray into the American banking market by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, parent of Pacific First. While Royal Trustco is giving up its dream of building an American banking empire anchored in Seattle, it will be stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate loans that are in default or heading that way. And the $663 million acquisition of Pacific First Financial Corp. marks the third major upheaval of banking in Washington in a year, which will mean more sign changes, building closures and potential layoffs for employees. Washington Mutual already has $8.4 billion in assets and 118 branches and 17 loan centers in Washington and Oregon. Pacific First has assets of $6.9 billion, 127 branches in Washington, Oregon and California and eight mortgage offices. It previously agreed to trade its 10 California branches for Great Western Bank's 14 Washington branches. Once the Pacific First deal is completed, Washington Mutual will have assets of about $14 billion... Pacific First is merely the latest in a series of acquisitions Washington Mutual has made in the last few years, including Pioneer Savings in Lynnwood, Great Northwest in Bremerton and VanFed in Vancouver. With Pacific First's branches, Washington Mutual's share of consumer deposits in Washington will be 17.2 percent, ahead of KeyCorp-Puget Sound with 10.3 percent and trailing only Seafirst at 20.4 percent, Tejera said. In Oregon, Washington Mutual will become the fourth biggest in consumer deposits.

^ MacKenzie, Bill (February 22, 1991). "Pacific First Tops Oregon Thrifts". The Oregonian. p. E15. (Subscription required (help)). Pacific First Bank, a Seattle-based thrift, has quietly become the largest holder of deposits among all thrifts operating in Oregon. It also operates 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift. Its rise has been due, in part, to turmoil in the thrift industry that has led to deposit declines at competitors and the shift of one large thrift to a bank. Pacific First had $1.1 billion in deposits at its Oregon branches at the end of 1989. A year later, deposits had grown to $2.3 billion. It now holds about 27 percent of the thrift market in Oregon and about 9 percent of the combined thrift and bank market. The next-largest Oregon thrift is Far West Federal Bank with $1.3 billion in deposits... Pacific First has been serving Oregonians since 1936, but it had only a few branches until December 1988, when it bought 17 branches of Salem-based American Home Savings. One year later the thrift was acquired by Toronto, Canada-based Royal Trustco, Canada's largest trust company, which injected $100 million of capital into the thrift and set it on an aggressive expansion course. Pacific First acquired the 45 branches of Willamette Savings and Loan in June and added the 12 Oregon branches of the Williamsburg Federal Savings and Loan Association in September. Some recently acquired branches have been closed, leaving the thrift with 78 Oregon branches spread throughout the state, but principally in the Portland metropolitan area and the Willamette Valley.

In an acquisition that will virtually double the size of the savings bank the day it is completed, Seattle-based Washington Mutual said it will acquire Keystone Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary, American Savings Bank of Irvine, Calif., in a stock deal worth about $1.4 billion, based on yesterday's closing price... In addition, because American's loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward adjustable rate mortgages, the acquisition helps Washington Mutual reduce its vulnerability to interest rate swings... The third attraction for investors is the presence of billionaire investor Robert Bass, who bought into American Savings when it was taken over by the government and reorganized in 1988. He assures me he has totally bought into the business plan. We believe he will be a good long-term shareholder, Killinger said of Bass. Bass will name two additional members to Washington Mutual's board, although Killinger said it's not likely Bass himself will serve... Washington Mutual, already at $22 million in assets, will grow to more than $42 million. It already operates 248 branches in Washington, Oregon, Utah, Idaho and Montana.

^ a b Adamson, Deborah (July 23, 1996). "American Savings Merging - Washington Mutual to Strengthen Coastal Presence With Deal". Los Angeles Daily News. p. B1. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Inc., a Seattle financial services firm, said Monday it will buy American Savings Bank and its parent company in a stock for stock transaction worth $3.5 billion. Irvine-based American Savings Bank will keep its name, and officials said they expect all branches to remain open, officials said... Washington Mutual, which owns a network of banks, is the No. 1 residential mortgage originator in Washington and Oregon. American Savings is California's second largest home-mortgage originator. The deal gives Washington Mutual its first presence in California, allowing an immediate foothold in key locations that will solidify its West Coast position... Robert M. Bass and his investor group control Keystone Holdings Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, the parent company of American Savings. After the acquisition, Keystone will be merged into Washington Mutual. The investor group will get 26 million of the 48 million shares to be issued by Washington Mutual in the merger. With total outstanding shares of 117.5 million, the group's share amounts to a 22 percent ownership in the new company, with Bass holding an 8 percent stake. About 14 million of the new shares will go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will sell them after the merger. The rest will be held in escrow pending the outcome of a Keystone lawsuit against the federal government. Washington Mutual also will assume Keystone's $365 million of debt and $80 million in outstanding preferred stock. Mario Antoci, American Savings' chairman and CEO, will retire after the deal closes. Post-merger management changes have not been finalized. Antoci took over American Savings in 1988, when the Bass Group bought it. American Savings Bank was originally part of American Savings and Loan, a failed thrift that led to the largest savings and loan bailout in history. The original thrift was divided into two parts: American Savings Bank controlled the profitable assets and loans while the other unit was liquidated. American Savings Bank has 220 branches in California and Arizona. Washington Mutual has 317 branches in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana. 
^ Fuquay, Jim (July 23, 1996). "Bass group bonanza - Keystone Holdings sells a California thrift in a deal valued at $1.6 billion.". Fort Worth Star-Telegram. p. 1. (Subscription required (help)). An investment group led by Fort Worth billionaire Robert M. Bass cashed in on a $400 million investment in California's American Savings yesterday, selling the thrift it acquired less than eight years ago. The deal was valued at more than $1.6 billion. Washington Mutual Inc., the parent of one of Washington state's largest savings banks, agreed to acquire the thrift for at least 40 million shares of Washington Mutual stock. That stock was worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at Friday's closing price. Washington Mutual will also assume $465 million in debt as part of the deal... Bass made his investment through Keystone Holdings, in which he owns about 36 percent. In 1988, Keystone acquired American Savings from the federal government, which had seized the thrift in 1984. Keystone invested $350 million in cash into American Savings and spent another $50 million in expenses to buy the institution, which at the time was America's biggest insolvent thrift. Keystone installed Mario J. Antoci, a respected thrift executive, to run American Savings. The thrift, stripped of its most troubled assets, immediately started making money... The Keystone group will also name two members of Washington Mutual's 13-person board, suggesting that the group is likely to retain its interest in the company.

The unsolicited offer by Irwindale-based H.F. Ahmanson & Co. would form the third-largest financial institution in California--after giant Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

Sources said possible bidders that Great Western may have contacted include First Bank System Inc., Washington Mutual Savings Bank and Norwest Corp. Local banking executives and analysts said Washington Mutual is likely to take a close look at a deal for Great Western, and said there are equally strong reasons why the Seattle-based thrift might bid or walk away. On the negative side, Washington Mutual is currently digesting a major California acquisition, a hurry-up deal wouldn't give it time to carefully review the transaction, it wouldn't get the same cost savings Ahmanson would to make the deal attractive, and a bidding war could become expensive.

Texas was something of an incidental market Washington Mutual picked up in its 1998 acquisition of H.F.

Ahmanson & Co., parent of Savings of America, and the Bank United merger will give it 3 percent of Texas deposits, according to June 30, 1999, reports, the latest available. Washington Mutual, which ranks No. 8 among all U.S. banks and thrifts, also has a previous Texas connection. In 1995, it acquired American Savings, a California thrift owned by Fort Worth investor Robert M. Bass, who became a major Washington Mutual shareholder as a result of that deal. A Bass lieutenant, Jay Crandall, remains on Washington Mutual's board of directors... Bank United has 155 retail branches in the state, including 77 in North Texas, along with 42 commercial loan offices and 11 other sales offices.

Washington Mutual, Inc., abbreviated to WaMu, was a savings bank holding company and the former owner of Washington Mutual Bank, which was the United States' largest savings and loan association until its collapse in 2008.[5][6][7][8][9]
On Thursday, September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) seized Washington Mutual Bank from Washington Mutual, Inc. and placed it into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The OTS took the action due to the withdrawal of $16.7 billion in deposits during a 9-day bank run (amounting to 9% of the deposits it had held on June 30, 2008).[10] The FDIC sold the banking subsidiaries (minus unsecured debt and equity claims) to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion, which JPMorgan Chase had been planning to acquire as part of a confidential plan internally nicknamed Project West.[11][12][13] All WaMu branches were rebranded as Chase branches by the end of 2009. The holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc., was left with $33 billion in assets, and $8 billion debt, after being stripped of its banking subsidiary by the FDIC.[6][7][14][15] The next day, September 26, Washington Mutual, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 voluntary bankruptcy in Delaware, where it was incorporated.[7][14]
With respect to total assets under management, Washington Mutual Bank's closure and receivership is the largest bank failure in American financial history.[6][7] Before the receivership action, it was the sixth-largest bank in the United States.[16] According to Washington Mutual Inc.'s 2007 SEC filing, the holding company held assets valued at $327.9 billion.[17]
On March 20, 2009, Washington Mutual Inc. filed suit against the FDIC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking damages of approximately $13 billion for what it claims was an unjustified seizure and an extremely low sale price to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase promptly filed a counterclaim in the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, where the Washington Mutual bankruptcy proceedings had been continuing since the Office of Thrift Supervision's seizure of the holding company's bank subsidiaries.[18][19]

Business operations prior to bank receivership[edit]




A former WaMu branch in the Chinatown section of New York City (2004)


Despite its name, Washington Mutual ceased being a mutual company in 1983 when it demutualized and became a public company on March 11.
On June 30, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank had total assets of US$307 billion, with 2,239 retail branch offices operating in 15 states, with 4,932 ATMs, and 43,198 employees. It held liabilities in the form of deposits of $188.3 billion, and owed $82.9 billion to the Federal Home Loan Bank, and had subordinated debt of $7.8 billion. It held as assets of $118.9 billion in single-family loans, of which $52.9 billion were "option adjustable rate mortgages" (Option ARMs), with $16 billion in subprime mortgage loans, and $53.4 billion of Home Equity lines of Credit (HELOCs) and credit cards receivables of $10.6 billion. It was servicing for itself and other banks loans totaling $689.7 billion, of which $442.7 were for other banks. It had non-performing assets of $11.6 billion, including $3.23 billion in payment option ARMs and $3.0 billion in subprime mortgage loans.[20]
On September 15, 2008, the holding company received a credit rating agency downgrade. From that date through September 24, 2008, WaMu experienced a bank run whereby customers withdrew $16.7 billion in deposits over those 9 days,[15] and in excess of $22 billion in cash outflow since July 2008, both conditions which ultimately led the Office of Thrift Supervision to close the bank.[20]
The FDIC then sold most of the bank's assets to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion in cash plus assumption of all secured debt and some unsecured debt. Claims of the subsidiary bank's equity holders, senior and subordinated debt (all primarily owned by the holding company) were not assumed by JPMorgan Chase[clarification needed].[7][21][22]
History[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower at 1201 Third Avenue in Seattle, Washington


Mutual savings bank[edit]
Washington Mutual was incorporated as the Washington National Building Loan and Investment Association on September 25, 1889, after the Great Seattle Fire destroyed 120 acres (49 ha) of the central business district of Seattle. The newly formed company made its first home mortgage loan on the West Coast on February 10, 1890. It changed its name to Washington Savings and Loan Association on June 25, 1908.[2] By September 12, 1917 it was operating under the name Washington Mutual Savings Bank.[23] The company purchased its first company, the financially distressed Continental Mutual Savings Bank, on July 25, 1930.[2] Its marketing slogan for much of its history was "The Friend of the Family".
Post demutualization growth[edit]
In April 1982, Washington Mutual purchased the brokerage firm Murphey Favre for undisclosed amount in cash[24] and demutualized the following year, converting into a capital stock savings bank.[25] Stock in the capital stock savings bank was first offered for sale on March 11, 1983.[26] By 1989, its assets had doubled.[2]
In November 1994, Washington Mutual formed a new holding called Washington Mutual, Inc. and separated its non-banking units from its primary banking unit, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, which was simultaneously renamed Washington Mutual Bank.[27][28][29] The company's stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under WAMU.
In October 2005, Washington Mutual purchased the formerly "subprime" credit card issuer Providian for approximately $6.5 billion, although Providian's new management team's strategy of targeting Prime credit card consumers had been underway since 2001, therefore the credit card unit's nonperforming loan portfolio had improved significantly prior to the company's sale to WaMu. In March 2006, Washington Mutual began the move into its new headquarters, WaMu Center, located in downtown Seattle. The company's previous headquarters, Washington Mutual Tower, stands about a block away from the new building on Second Avenue. In August 2006, Washington Mutual began using the official abbreviation of WaMu in all but legal situations.
Acquisitions[edit]

After the acquisition of Murphey Favre, WaMu made numerous acquisitions with the aim of expanding the corporation. By acquiring companies including PNC Mortgage, Fleet Mortgage and Homeside Lending, WaMu became the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. With the acquisition of Providian Financial Corporation in October 2005, WaMu became the nation's 9th-largest credit-card company.
A partial list of Washington Mutual acquisitions since demutualization:[30]

Commercial Capital Bancorp, California, 2006
Providian Financial Corporation, California, 2005
HomeSide Lending, Inc., Florida, a unit of National Australia Bank, 2002
Fleet Mortgage Corp., South Carolina, 2001
PNC Mortgage, Illinois, 2001
Alta Residential Mortgage Trust, California, 2000
Long Beach Financial Corp., California, 1999


Many of Washington Mutual's acquisitions became reviled as the rapid post-merger integrations resulted in numerous errors. The purchase of the original PNC Mortgage came at a time when subprime lending was in a "boom" period, with PNC Financial Services believing that the market was too volatile.[31] (PNC later re-entered the mortgage market in 2009 through its acquisition of National City Corp., with no plans to re-enter subprime lending.) The Dime merger resulted in account ownership to be split with account beneficiaries. The Fleet Mortgage merger resulted in entire loans simply disappearing — being serviced, but unable to be found by customer service representatives.[citation needed]

In January 1990, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of all seven offices of the Seattle-based Old Stone Bank of Washington from the Rhode Island-based Old Stone Corporation for an undisclosed amount.[39][40][41] Old Stone originally entered the state of Washington through the acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Citizens Federal Savings and Loan Association in 1985 with the assistance of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.[42][43][44] The acquisition by Washington Mutual was completed in June 1990 for $10 million.[45][46]

The acquisition was contingent on having Pacific First dispose of its branch offices in California and having its Canadian parent Royal Trustco assume all of Pacific First's bad loans.[64][65][66] The acquisition by was completed in April 1993.[67] At the time of the initial announcement in October 1992, Washington Mutual had 118 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Pacific First had 127 branch offices in Washington, Oregon and California. Pacific First had previously announced that it was trading its California offices for Great Western's Washington offices. As a result of the Pacific First acquisition, Washington Mutual became one of the largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits in the state of Washington, second only to Seafirst.[66]
In June 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Summit Bancorp with its Summit Savings Bank subsidiary for $25 million in stock.[68] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 231 branch offices in Washington and Oregon. The acquisition by was completed in November 1994.[69]
In June 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank for $26.8 million in stock.[70][71][72] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 260 branch offices. Unlike the previous acquisition targets, Enterprise held a commercial bank charter and not a thrift charter.
Expansion in Oregon[edit]
In April 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the 25 offices in the Portland, Oregon / Vancouver, Washington area from the ailing New York-based CrossLand Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Brooklyn Bancorp, for an undisclosed amount.[73] The acquisition by was completed in November 1991.[52] Seven of the 25 offices were located in Washington with the remainder in Oregon. As part of the transaction, CrossLand Savings closed seven offices in Oregon and three offices in Washington, leaving eleven offices in Oregon and four in Washington.[52] CrossLand had previously entered Oregon (and three other states) through the relatively recent acquisition of the troubled Utah-based Western Savings and Loan Association.[74][75][76] The CrossLand acquisition gave Washington Mutual a toe hold entry into Oregon via Portland.
As a result of the Pacific First acquisition in April 1993, Washington Mutual became the fourth largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits within the state of Oregon.[66] Originally, Pacific First grew quickly in Oregon during the late 1980s through the acquisition of troubled savings and loans.[77][78] By February 1991, Pacific First had 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift.[79] Pacific First had 71 branches in Oregon by July 1992.[80]
In April 1994, Washington Mutual announced the completed acquisition of three Portland-area offices of the failed Portland-based Far West Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $2.2 million.[81]
In October 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Coos Bay-based Western Bank for $156 million in stock.[82][83][84][85] The acquisition by was completed in February 1996.[86] Since Western Bank possessed a commercial bank charter and not a more restrictive savings & loan charter, Washington Mutual decided to allow Western Bank to keep its charter and name and to remain semi-autonomous for a while. At the time of the acquisition, Western Bank had 41 offices throughout Oregon. Five years later, Washington Mutual decided to abandon the Western Bank brand and integrate most of the former Western Bank offices into the existing Washington Mutual network in Oregon in 2001.[87][88] Due to branch overlaps between the two brands, 12 Western Bank branch offices and one Washington Mutual branch office were sold to the Klamath Falls-based Klamath First Bancorp for $33 million.[89][90]
Expansion in Idaho[edit]
In March 1994, Washington Mutual announced that they were planning to expand into the state of Idaho by building new branch offices inside Fred Meyer supermarket stores with the first three being opened in the Boise-area in July and August.[91][92][93][94]
In the following year, Washington Mutual opened a fourth Idaho location in a Moscow supermarket in February 1995.[95]
A branch office in Idaho Falls was acquired from the Utah-based United Savings Bank when Washington Mutual purchased the savings bank in January 1997.[96]
By March 2000, there were 9 locations within Idaho[97] and later 22 locations in 2008 when Chase acquired Washington Mutual.[98]
Expansion in Utah[edit]
In July 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank, FSB, subsidiary for $52.1 million in stock.[99][100] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 250 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Olympus had eight branch offices in Utah and two in Montana. The acquisition by was completed in May 1995.[101]
In March 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Ogden-based Utah Federal Savings Bank for an undisclosed amount.[102][103] At the time of the announcement, Utah Federal had five branch offices while Washington Mutual had 16 within Utah. The acquisition by was completed in December 1996 for $15.2 million.[104]
In September 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based United Western Financial Group Inc. with its United Savings Bank subsidiary for $80.3 million in cash.[105][106][107][108] At the time of the announcement, United Savings Bank had eight branch offices in Utah and one in Idaho. The acquisition by was completed in January 1997.[96]
Expansion in Montana[edit]
In May 1995, Washington Mutual acquired two branch offices in Butte as the result of the acquisition of the Utah-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank FSB subsidiary. Four years later, Washington Mutual later sold the two offices to Glacier Bancorp in 1999 for an undisclosed amount and quietly left the state of Montana.[109][110]
Expansion in California[edit]
 In July 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Fort Worth, Texas-based Keystone Holdings Inc. with its Irvine-based American Savings Bank subsidiary for $1.6 billion in stock.[111][112][113][114][115][116] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 317 branch offices in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana while American Savings Bank had 220 branch offices in California.[115] The acquisition by was completed in December 1996.[117][118][119][120] American kept its name after the acquisition. The result of the acquisition nearly doubled the total deposits of all Washington Mutual subsidiaries from $22 billion to $42 billion.
In February 1997, the Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial, the holding company for second largest thrift in the nation Great Western Bank, found itself the target of a hostile takeover attempt of arch-rival H. F. Ahmanson & Co., the holding company for the largest thrift in the nation Home Savings of America, that would have involved $5.8 billion worth of stock. Since the two companies had large overlapping territories, many Great Western offices would have been closed by the victor if the takeover attempt had succeeded.[121][122][123] The only way the combat a hostile takeover was to find another company, called a white knight that would allow a merger on much better terms. One such company was Washington Mutual. In March, Great Western Financial announced that it had accepted Washington Mutual's merger proposal for $6.6 billion in Washington Mutual stock.[124][125][126] Ahmanson quickly increased their bids[127] but the bids were also rejected.[128] Great Western approved the merger with Washington Mutual in June[129] and the merger was completed in July.[130][131] As part of its merger agreement, it was originally announced that Great Western offices would be allowed to keep the Great Western name and there were later discussion of converting the American Savings offices to the Great Western brand. In the end, it was felt that it was best for the company to have only one brand throughout the nation instead of multiple regional brands so it was announce in December 1997 that both Great Western and American names would be retired in favor of the Washington Mutual name.[132] The previous month, it was announced in November that 85 redundant branch offices were identified in California and were to be closed within the following year.[133][134] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 413 branch operating under various names across the country while Great Western had 416 branch offices operating in California and Florida.[135]
In March 1998, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irwindale-based H. F. Ahmanson & Company with its Home Savings of America subsidiary for approximately $10 billion in stock.[136][137][138] The acquisition by was completed in October 1998 for only $6.9 billion in stock.[139] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 892 branch operating under various names (Washington Mutual, American Savings, Great Western, etc.) across the country while Home Savings had 409 branch offices operating in California and Texas.[140][141] A few days after the completion of the merger, Washington Mutual announces plans to close 161 branch offices in California.[142][143]
Expansion in Texas[edit]
Through the 1998 acquisition of Home Savings, Washington Mutual had gained 48 branch offices in Texas.
In August 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Houston-based Bank United Corporation with its 155 branch offices, all located in Texas, for $1.49 billion in stock.[144][145][146] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[147][148]
As a result of branch overlap between Bank United and Washington Mutual, 17 branch offices were closed in Texas, 10 of which were in Houston.[149] [150]
Expansion in New York[edit]
In June 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the New York City-based Dime Bancorp with its Dime Savings Bank subsidiary for $5.2 billion in cash and stock.[151][152] The acquisition by was completed in January 2002.[153] Dime had 123 branch offices in the New York City area of both New York and New Jersey.[154]
Commercial banking[edit]
With a thrift charter, there were a few things that Washington Mutual was not able to do until it was able to obtain a commercial bank charter, such as making commercial loans above a certain size. To get around this problem, Washington Mutual began to purchase commercial banks and maintain them as separate business entities. In August 1995, Washington Mutual acquired the one office Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank in Washington. A few months later, Washington Mutual acquired the 41 office Coos Bay-based Western Bank in Oregon.[86] By 2007, Enterprise was merged into Western and operated as branch of Western.[155]
After Washington Mutual expanded into California through the acquisitions of American Savings, Great Western, and Home Savings, Washington Mutual quietly acquired the one-office Industrial Bank in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles an undisclosed amount in 1999[156][157] and renamed it WM Business Bank.[156]
By 2001, Washington Mutual had 38 specialized business banking centers operating under the Western Bank name in the Northwest and the WM Business Bank name in California when they decided to exit the commercial banking market that was then dominated with the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America.[87]
Mortgage banking[edit]
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Washington Mutual decided to aggressively expand in the subprime mortgage lending field through the acquisition of existing mortgage companies at a time when other financial institutions were leaving.
In May 1999, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Orange, California-based Long Beach Financial Corporation with its Long Beach Mortgage Company subsidiary for $350.4 million in cash and stock.[158][159] The acquisition by was completed in October 1999.[160] Long Beach had specialized in providing subprime mortgages. Some of Long Beach's questionable business practices may have led to Washington Mutual's failure in 2008.[161]
In January 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Los Angeles-based Alta Residential Mortgage Trust for $23 million.[162]
In October 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based PNC Mortgage Corporation and PNC Mortgage Securities Corporation from the PNC Financial Services Group for $605 million in cash.[163][164] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[165] The result of the PNC Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's third-largest lender.
In April 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Columbia, South Carolina-based Fleet Mortgage Corporation from FleetBoston Financial for $660 million in cash.[166] The acquisition by was completed in June 2001.[167] The result of the Fleet Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's second-largest mortgage-servicing business.
In December 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Jacksonville, Florida-based HomeSide Lending, Inc. from the National Australia Bank for $1.9 billion. The agreement did not include the mortgage servicing rights and related financial hedges for the business.[168][169] The acquisition by was completed in March 2002.[170] In August 2002, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the rest of HomeSide that included the mortgage servicing rights on a mortgage portfolio worth about $131 billion for $1.3 billion in cash and the assumption of $735 million in debt.[171] The acquisition by was completed in October 2002.[172]
In July 2002, the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Capital Corporation announced the pending sale of the mortgage loan portfolio for its Bay View Bank subsidiary to Washington Mutual for a "slight premium to book value".[173] The sale by was completed in the following month.[174]
In April 2006, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irvine, California-based Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. with its Commercial Capital Bank FSB subsidiary for $983 million in cash.[175][176] The acquisition by was completed in October 2006.[177] Commercial Capital had specialized in loans for the multifamily and small commercial real estate lending markets and was the third largest multifamily lender in California.
Rise and fall[edit]
"Wal-Mart of Banking"[edit]
Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger had pledged in 2003: "We hope to do to this industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe's, Home Depot did to their industry. And I think if we’ve done our job, five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank."[178]
Killinger's goal was to build WaMu into the "Wal-Mart of Banking", which would cater to lower- and middle-class consumers that other banks deemed too risky. Complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing, a strategy the bank extended in big cities, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. WaMu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets. WaMu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than $10,000 for bringing in borrowers. Variable-rate loans — Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (Option ARMs) in particular — were especially attractive, because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed WaMu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred. As WaMu was selling many of its loans to investors, it worried less about defaults.[9][178]
Subprime losses[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower (center right) in downtown Seattle was Washington Mutual's corporate headquarters from 1988 until 2006, when the company moved into the new WaMu Center (center left). These buildings have since been renamed; Washington Mutual Tower is now known as 1201 Third Avenue and WaMu Center is now known as Russell Investments Center.


In December 2007, the subsidiary Washington Mutual Bank reorganized its home-loan division, closing 160 of its 336 home-loan offices and removing 2,600 positions in its home-loan staff (a 22% reduction).[179]
In March 2008, on the same weekend that JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon negotiated the takeover of Bear Stearns, he secretly dispatched members of his team to Seattle to meet with WaMu executives, urging them to consider a quick deal. However, WaMu Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger rejected JPMorgan Chase's offer that valued WaMu at $8 a share, mostly in stock.[9][178]
In April 2008, the holding company, responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis, announced that 3,000 people companywide would lose their jobs, and the company stated its intent to close its approximately 176 remaining stand-alone, home-loan offices, including 23 in Washington and a loan-processing center in Bellevue, Washington. It stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as "wholesale lending." WaMu also announced a $7 billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by TPG Capital. TPG agreed to pump $2 billion into the Washington Mutual holding company; other investors, including some of WaMu's current institutional holders, agreed to buy an additional $5 billion in newly issued stock. This angered many investors, as TPG's investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, and as WaMu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses.[180]
In June 2008, Kerry Killinger stepped down as the Chairman, though remaining the Chief Executive Officer.[181] On September 8, 2008, under pressure from investors, the Washington Mutual holding company's board of directors dismissed Killinger as the CEO. Alan H. Fishman, chairman of mortgage broker Meridian Capital Group, and a former chief operating officer of Sovereign Bank, was named the new CEO for 17 days.[182]
Seizure by OTS and FDIC[edit]
By mid-September 2008, WaMu's share price had closed as low as $2.00. It had been worth over $30.00 in September 2007, and had briefly traded as high as $45 in the previous year.[183] While WaMu publicly insisted it could stay independent, earlier in the month it had quietly hired Goldman Sachs to identify potential bidders. However, several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid.[16] At the same time, WaMu suffered a massive run (mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfer[citation needed]); customers pulled out $16.7 billion in deposits in a ten-day span.[184]
This led the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to step up pressure for WaMu to find a buyer, as a takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could have been a severe drain on the FDIC insurance fund, which had already been hard hit by the failure of IndyMac that year. The FDIC ultimately held a secret auction of Washington Mutual Bank. Finally, on the morning of Thursday, September 25 (which happened to be the 119th anniversary of WaMu's establishment), regulators informed JPMorgan Chase that they were the winners.[16]
On Thursday night (shortly after the close of business on the West Coast), the Office of Thrift Supervision seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC. In a statement, the OTS said that the massive run meant that WaMu was no longer sound.[184] The FDIC, as receiver, sold most of Washington Mutual Bank's assets, including the branch network, to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. JPMorgan agreed to assume the bank's secured debts and liabilities to depositors. The transaction did not require any FDIC insurance funds.[185] Normally, bank seizures take place after the close of business on Fridays. However, due to the bank's deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent, regulators felt compelled to act a day early.[16]
Because JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual's assets for a low price, WaMu's stockholders were nearly wiped out. Its stock price dropped to $0.16 a share, far from $45 a share in 2007.[183] In its Chapter 11 filing, WaMu listed assets of $33 billion and debt of $8 billion. (ref. Appendix A). The filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors.
Within days of the seizure, a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist, Mike Stathis of AVA Investment Analytics, issued a formal complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, demonstrating evidence of insider trading. The complaint also alleged that Washington Mutual was not insolvent, and several Wall Street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock. He also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press who told him that he was contacted by a Washington Mutual executive hours before the seizure, telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons.” In later criticisms, Stathis discussed that neither the FDIC nor OTS ever disclosed any evidence of Washington Mutual's insolvency.[186] Stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint, he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning. As a result of this, Stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the SEC complaint into the public domain until a year later.[187][188]
Shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of Washington Mutual through such websites as WaMuCoup.com (dead link) and others, claiming that the OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of JPMorgan Chase, which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price. Shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover, the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the OTS 2 weeks earlier[189] and that the holding company's board and management was kept completely in the dark about the government's negotiations with Chase, hampering the bank's ability to sell itself on its own. Chief executive Alan H. Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed, and eventually received a $7.5 million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6 million (which he declined) after being CEO for 17 days.[190] Senator Maria Cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation[191] and Washington Mutual's former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares.[189]
The seizure of WaMu Bank resulted in the largest bank failure in American financial history, far exceeding the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984.[16][192][193]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc., and its remaining subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[194] Washington Mutual, Inc., was promptly delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and commenced trading via Pink Sheets. The bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks, after the Lehman Brothers filing eleven days earlier; both bankruptcies far outpaced WorldCom's 2002 filing, which had held the record with just under $104 billion in assets (Washington Mutual's alone, which was approximately half that of Lehman Brothers, was three times as much as WorldCom's).
All assets but only some liabilities (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank were assumed by JPMorgan Chase.[195] Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase acquired all the banking operations of WaMu, including $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits, for a price of $1.9 billion plus debt assumptions.[196] Unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the FDIC, leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery.[195] On Friday, Sep. 26, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank customers were informed that Deposits held by Washington Mutual became now liabilities of JPMorgan Chase.[197]
The IRS claimed $12.5 billion in back taxes from Washington Mutual, Inc.. The company filed court papers on January 22, 2009 alleging losses were $20 billion, and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt, stating that the IRS could owe Washington Mutual Inc. a tax refund.[198] In a settlement between Wash. Mutual Inc. (in receivership), the FDIC, and JPMorgan Chase that Wash. Mutual Inc. recently made public, a tax refund of about US$5.7 billion will be shared between Wash. Mutual Inc., JPMorgan Chase and FDIC.[199]
Washington Mutual, Inc., sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for US$13 billion after the sale of its banking operations to JPMorgan Chase.[200] WMI attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank, and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken.
On January 11, 2010, the United States Department of Justice, Office of the United States Trustee, District of Delaware, pursuant to Section 1102(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, appointed a Committee of Equity Security Holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock. All of the Motions to Disband the Committee of Equity Security Holders were denied on January 28, 2010 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath, District of Delaware.[201][202]
On July 20, 2010, bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath approved a motion of the EC for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of WMI, handing a victory to shareholders. The Judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase at the heart of WaMu's reorganization, but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company.[203]
On July 26, 2010, U.S. Trustee Roberta A. DeAngelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP partner Joshua R. Hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC. Hochberg is a partner in McKenna Long & Aldridge's Washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense, internal investigations and compliance.[204]
On August 10, 2010, the bankruptcy judge rejected Washington Mutual Inc.'s effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting. Attorneys for the EC said that WMI was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information. The judge agreed that WMI was not entitled to the information.[205]
On November 1, 2010, examiner Joshua R. Hochberg from McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP presented his long-awaited report, but it did not meet the expectations of the court, since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorney-client work. On December 12, the court decided to exclude the examiner's report during the plan confirmation hearings, saying it can't be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions.[206]
On January 7, 2011, the bankruptcy court rejected the 6th proposed plan of reorganization, which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Judge Mary Walrath focused many of her criticisms on the company's releases of liability granted to directors, officers and others including some hedge funds, who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement. She noted for example that shareholders, who will likely get nothing, should not have to release the company's board from the threat of being sued by them.[207] However, many WaMu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when Washington Mutual emerges from bankruptcy.
On September 14, 2011, the court also rejected the modified 6th proposed plan of reorganization. Judge Mary F. Walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt. The four hedge funds are Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management.[208]
A seventh plan of reorganization was announced in February 2012[209][210] and the company finally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month as WMI Holdings Corporation.[211] By 2015, WMI Holdings was able to raise $598 million and was looking for new acquisitions.[212]
Post receivership bank operations[edit]
During 2009, all of the Washington Mutual Bank branches that had been purchased from the FDIC after the bank had been placed into receivership, were rebranded to Chase or shuttered. All financial documents issued by WaMu were changed to carry the JPMorgan Chase logo. Credit and debit cards issued by WaMu or Providian were changed to carry the Chase logo.
Since 2009, Chase ATMs have been accessible for WaMu customers at no extra charge, and the branches and accounts were formally merged in 2009 as the WaMu brand was retired.[16] Branches in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Utah were rebranded in May 2009; branches in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Greater New York were rebranded in July 2009, and the remaining branches in Nevada, California, Arizona, and Colorado were rebranded in October 2009.[213][214] The last rebrandings formally retired the WaMu name.
In markets where Chase already had a dominant presence, such as Greater New York and Chicago owing to the presence of Chase and predecessor Bank One (in New York, the merger resulted in different branches on the same block), Chase further disposed of such branches to other banks.[215]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
"Free Checking Account"[edit]
This advertising campaign was introduced between 2005 and 2007. Numerous WaMu commercials showed traditionally-dressed 60-70-year-old overweight bankers laughing out loud at a WaMu representative (who is much younger and fitter), who says the words "Free Checking Account".
"The Power of Yes"[edit]
WaMu introduced an advertising campaign during the 2003 Academy Awards known as “The Power of Yes”. This was to promote the offering of loans to all consumers, particularly borrowers that the banks deemed too risky. Another commercial in the ad series showed WaMu representatives in casual clothes, contrasting with traditionally-dressed bankers in suits.
"Whoo hoo"[edit]




A promotional Washington Mutual "Whoo hoo!" bumper sticker.


"Whoo hoo!" was an advertising campaign introduced by Washington Mutual in February 2008. As fears of an economic crisis were rising, and WaMu was looking to become an "iconic brand that people love", they began courting consumers with a new slogan, designed to position WaMu as a consumer-friendly institution.[216]
During its run, the Whoo hoo! ads, created by TBWA\Chiat\Day of Playa del Rey, California,[216] become widespread in web navigation.[217] After WaMu launched the new advertisement, there was double digit growth at its website[217] and the term “wamu” appeared in searches over 1,000% more between January and March than in all of 2007.[217]
Washington Mutual (before the bank's September 2008 conservatorship and sale to JPMorgan Chase) applied to register a trademark in the phrase.[218][219] Initially, the bank wanted to use "woo hoo" (without the "h" in the first word) as the slogan, but they were concerned because of the existing use of the phrase by Homer Simpson, a character in The Simpsons.[218]
Occasio branch design[edit]
Washington Mutual introduced a unique branch design known as Occasio which eliminated traditional teller windows and queuing stanchions in favor of an open, circular floor plan with a greeter or "concierge" position and tellers working from behind podiums.[220][221] The Occasio design was introduced in 2000 and patented in 2004,[222] but was phased out following the JPMorgan Chase acquisition of Washington Mutual's retail banking operations.[223]

In one of the Pacific Northwest's biggest financial transactions of its kind, Washington Mutual Savings Bank said today it won the sweepstakes to take control of Pacific First Financial Corp., parent company to Pacific First Bank. The move will make Washington Mutual the second-largest financial institution in Washington and give it a huge initial presence in Oregon. Washington Mutual said it will pay $663 million for the rival institution - both have Seattle headquarters. After the deal is done next May or June, Washington Mutual will be second in size here only to Seafirst Bank. Just three years ago, then publicly held Pacific First was acquired by Royal Trustco of Toronto, Canada, for $212 million. But since then, Royal Trustco has run into problems elsewhere, and decided to abandon its strategy to string branches along the West Coast of the United States. It put Pacific First up for bid.

^ a b c Virgin, Bill (October 28, 1992). "Washington Mutual Plans to Buy Pacific First Bank". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. p. B5. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Savings Bank will buy Pacific First Bank in a deal that cements its position as one of the three leading financial institutions in the Pacific Northwest. It also brings to a somewhat messy and expensive end a foray into the American banking market by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, parent of Pacific First. While Royal Trustco is giving up its dream of building an American banking empire anchored in Seattle, it will be stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate loans that are in default or heading that way. And the $663 million acquisition of Pacific First Financial Corp. marks the third major upheaval of banking in Washington in a year, which will mean more sign changes, building closures and potential layoffs for employees. Washington Mutual already has $8.4 billion in assets and 118 branches and 17 loan centers in Washington and Oregon. Pacific First has assets of $6.9 billion, 127 branches in Washington, Oregon and California and eight mortgage offices. It previously agreed to trade its 10 California branches for Great Western Bank's 14 Washington branches. Once the Pacific First deal is completed, Washington Mutual will have assets of about $14 billion... Pacific First is merely the latest in a series of acquisitions Washington Mutual has made in the last few years, including Pioneer Savings in Lynnwood, Great Northwest in Bremerton and VanFed in Vancouver. With Pacific First's branches, Washington Mutual's share of consumer deposits in Washington will be 17.2 percent, ahead of KeyCorp-Puget Sound with 10.3 percent and trailing only Seafirst at 20.4 percent, Tejera said. In Oregon, Washington Mutual will become the fourth biggest in consumer deposits.

^ MacKenzie, Bill (February 22, 1991). "Pacific First Tops Oregon Thrifts". The Oregonian. p. E15. (Subscription required (help)). Pacific First Bank, a Seattle-based thrift, has quietly become the largest holder of deposits among all thrifts operating in Oregon. It also operates 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift. Its rise has been due, in part, to turmoil in the thrift industry that has led to deposit declines at competitors and the shift of one large thrift to a bank. Pacific First had $1.1 billion in deposits at its Oregon branches at the end of 1989. A year later, deposits had grown to $2.3 billion. It now holds about 27 percent of the thrift market in Oregon and about 9 percent of the combined thrift and bank market. The next-largest Oregon thrift is Far West Federal Bank with $1.3 billion in deposits... Pacific First has been serving Oregonians since 1936, but it had only a few branches until December 1988, when it bought 17 branches of Salem-based American Home Savings. One year later the thrift was acquired by Toronto, Canada-based Royal Trustco, Canada's largest trust company, which injected $100 million of capital into the thrift and set it on an aggressive expansion course. Pacific First acquired the 45 branches of Willamette Savings and Loan in June and added the 12 Oregon branches of the Williamsburg Federal Savings and Loan Association in September. Some recently acquired branches have been closed, leaving the thrift with 78 Oregon branches spread throughout the state, but principally in the Portland metropolitan area and the Willamette Valley.

(Subscription required (help)). In a deal that will both expand it geographically and diversify its lines of business, Washington Mutual Inc. said yesterday it has an agreement to buy Western Bank of Coos Bay, Ore... Western Bank has 41 offices in 33 Oregon communities, so the acquisition will add to Washington Mutual's 72 branches in that state. It also adds 20 towns Washington Mutual isn't already in. Washington Mutual is already the leading residential real estate lender in Oregon. But the deal also increases Washington Mutual's reach into the commercial banking market. Washington Mutual has traditionally emphasized the thrift business, which means home mortgage and consumer loans. Western, being a commercial bank, focuses on lending to small- and medium-sized businesses. Commercial banking is a business Washington Mutual has been increasingly interested in. Last month it wrapped up a deal to acquire the 90 percent of Bellevue's Enterprise Bank it didn't already own. Like Enterprise, Western Bank will continue to operate under its existing name and management.

In an acquisition that will virtually double the size of the savings bank the day it is completed, Seattle-based Washington Mutual said it will acquire Keystone Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary, American Savings Bank of Irvine, Calif., in a stock deal worth about $1.4 billion, based on yesterday's closing price... In addition, because American's loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward adjustable rate mortgages, the acquisition helps Washington Mutual reduce its vulnerability to interest rate swings... The third attraction for investors is the presence of billionaire investor Robert Bass, who bought into American Savings when it was taken over by the government and reorganized in 1988. He assures me he has totally bought into the business plan. We believe he will be a good long-term shareholder, Killinger said of Bass. Bass will name two additional members to Washington Mutual's board, although Killinger said it's not likely Bass himself will serve... Washington Mutual, already at $22 million in assets, will grow to more than $42 million. It already operates 248 branches in Washington, Oregon, Utah, Idaho and Montana.

^ a b Adamson, Deborah (July 23, 1996). "American Savings Merging - Washington Mutual to Strengthen Coastal Presence With Deal". Los Angeles Daily News. p. B1. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Inc., a Seattle financial services firm, said Monday it will buy American Savings Bank and its parent company in a stock for stock transaction worth $3.5 billion. Irvine-based American Savings Bank will keep its name, and officials said they expect all branches to remain open, officials said... Washington Mutual, which owns a network of banks, is the No. 1 residential mortgage originator in Washington and Oregon. American Savings is California's second largest home-mortgage originator. The deal gives Washington Mutual its first presence in California, allowing an immediate foothold in key locations that will solidify its West Coast position... Robert M. Bass and his investor group control Keystone Holdings Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, the parent company of American Savings. After the acquisition, Keystone will be merged into Washington Mutual. The investor group will get 26 million of the 48 million shares to be issued by Washington Mutual in the merger. With total outstanding shares of 117.5 million, the group's share amounts to a 22 percent ownership in the new company, with Bass holding an 8 percent stake. About 14 million of the new shares will go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will sell them after the merger. The rest will be held in escrow pending the outcome of a Keystone lawsuit against the federal government. Washington Mutual also will assume Keystone's $365 million of debt and $80 million in outstanding preferred stock. Mario Antoci, American Savings' chairman and CEO, will retire after the deal closes. Post-merger management changes have not been finalized. Antoci took over American Savings in 1988, when the Bass Group bought it. American Savings Bank was originally part of American Savings and Loan, a failed thrift that led to the largest savings and loan bailout in history. The original thrift was divided into two parts: American Savings Bank controlled the profitable assets and loans while the other unit was liquidated. American Savings Bank has 220 branches in California and Arizona. Washington Mutual has 317 branches in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana. 
^ Fuquay, Jim (July 23, 1996). "Bass group bonanza - Keystone Holdings sells a California thrift in a deal valued at $1.6 billion.". Fort Worth Star-Telegram. p. 1. (Subscription required (help)). An investment group led by Fort Worth billionaire Robert M. Bass cashed in on a $400 million investment in California's American Savings yesterday, selling the thrift it acquired less than eight years ago. The deal was valued at more than $1.6 billion. Washington Mutual Inc., the parent of one of Washington state's largest savings banks, agreed to acquire the thrift for at least 40 million shares of Washington Mutual stock. That stock was worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at Friday's closing price. Washington Mutual will also assume $465 million in debt as part of the deal... Bass made his investment through Keystone Holdings, in which he owns about 36 percent. In 1988, Keystone acquired American Savings from the federal government, which had seized the thrift in 1984. Keystone invested $350 million in cash into American Savings and spent another $50 million in expenses to buy the institution, which at the time was America's biggest insolvent thrift. Keystone installed Mario J. Antoci, a respected thrift executive, to run American Savings. The thrift, stripped of its most troubled assets, immediately started making money... The Keystone group will also name two members of Washington Mutual's 13-person board, suggesting that the group is likely to retain its interest in the company.

On the negative side, Washington Mutual is currently digesting a major California acquisition, a hurry-up deal wouldn't give it time to carefully review the transaction, it wouldn't get the same cost savings Ahmanson would to make the deal attractive, and a bidding war could become expensive.

Texas was something of an incidental market Washington Mutual picked up in its 1998 acquisition of H.F.

The deal, valued at $1.5 billion and expected to close by year's end, will greatly increase Washington Mutual's presence in the state. The Seattle-based institution entered Texas in 1998 with its acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson & Co., parent of Savings of America, and the Bank United merger will give it 3 percent of Texas deposits, according to June 30, 1999, reports, the latest available. Washington Mutual, which ranks No. 8 among all U.S. banks and thrifts, also has a previous Texas connection. In 1995, it acquired American Savings, a California thrift owned by Fort Worth investor Robert M. Bass, who became a major Washington Mutual shareholder as a result of that deal. A Bass lieutenant, Jay Crandall, remains on Washington Mutual's board of directors... Bank United has 155 retail branches in the state, including 77 in North Texas, along with 42 commercial loan offices and 11 other sales offices. Washington Mutual has 48 branches in Texas, including two in Tarrant County... About a dozen Texas branches share overlapping market areas, the companies said.

It was so small a deal that Washington Mutual Inc. didn't even bother putting out an announcement about it. For a company with $166 billion in assets and offices from coast to coast, the acquisition of Industrial Bank of Van Nuys, Calif., which has one office and $30 million in assets, created hardly a ripple. But the significance of the acquisition was not in the numbers, or Washington Mutual wouldn't have bothered making it. For Washington Mutual, Industrial Bank is a way to boost its often overlooked but growing commercial banking business in California.

Washington Mutual, Inc., abbreviated to WaMu, was a savings bank holding company and the former owner of Washington Mutual Bank, which was the United States' largest savings and loan association until its collapse in 2008.[5][6][7][8][9]
On Thursday, September 25, 2008, the United States Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) seized Washington Mutual Bank from Washington Mutual, Inc. and placed it into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The OTS took the action due to the withdrawal of $16.7 billion in deposits during a 9-day bank run (amounting to 9% of the deposits it had held on June 30, 2008).[10] The FDIC sold the banking subsidiaries (minus unsecured debt and equity claims) to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion, which JPMorgan Chase had been planning to acquire as part of a confidential plan internally nicknamed Project West.[11][12][13] All WaMu branches were rebranded as Chase branches by the end of 2009. The holding company, Washington Mutual, Inc., was left with $33 billion in assets, and $8 billion debt, after being stripped of its banking subsidiary by the FDIC.[6][7][14][15] The next day, September 26, Washington Mutual, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 voluntary bankruptcy in Delaware, where it was incorporated.[7][14]
With respect to total assets under management, Washington Mutual Bank's closure and receivership is the largest bank failure in American financial history.[6][7] Before the receivership action, it was the sixth-largest bank in the United States.[16] According to Washington Mutual Inc.'s 2007 SEC filing, the holding company held assets valued at $327.9 billion.[17]
On March 20, 2009, Washington Mutual Inc. filed suit against the FDIC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking damages of approximately $13 billion for what it claims was an unjustified seizure and an extremely low sale price to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase promptly filed a counterclaim in the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, where the Washington Mutual bankruptcy proceedings had been continuing since the Office of Thrift Supervision's seizure of the holding company's bank subsidiaries.[18][19]

Business operations prior to bank receivership[edit]




A former WaMu branch in the Chinatown section of New York City (2004)


Despite its name, Washington Mutual ceased being a mutual company in 1983 when it demutualized and became a public company on March 11.
On June 30, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank had total assets of US$307 billion, with 2,239 retail branch offices operating in 15 states, with 4,932 ATMs, and 43,198 employees. It held liabilities in the form of deposits of $188.3 billion, and owed $82.9 billion to the Federal Home Loan Bank, and had subordinated debt of $7.8 billion. It held as assets of $118.9 billion in single-family loans, of which $52.9 billion were "option adjustable rate mortgages" (Option ARMs), with $16 billion in subprime mortgage loans, and $53.4 billion of Home Equity lines of Credit (HELOCs) and credit cards receivables of $10.6 billion. It was servicing for itself and other banks loans totaling $689.7 billion, of which $442.7 were for other banks. It had non-performing assets of $11.6 billion, including $3.23 billion in payment option ARMs and $3.0 billion in subprime mortgage loans.[20]
On September 15, 2008, the holding company received a credit rating agency downgrade. From that date through September 24, 2008, WaMu experienced a bank run whereby customers withdrew $16.7 billion in deposits over those 9 days,[15] and in excess of $22 billion in cash outflow since July 2008, both conditions which ultimately led the Office of Thrift Supervision to close the bank.[20]
The FDIC then sold most of the bank's assets to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion in cash plus assumption of all secured debt and some unsecured debt. Claims of the subsidiary bank's equity holders, senior and subordinated debt (all primarily owned by the holding company) were not assumed by JPMorgan Chase[clarification needed].[7][21][22]
History[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower at 1201 Third Avenue in Seattle, Washington


Mutual savings bank[edit]
Washington Mutual was incorporated as the Washington National Building Loan and Investment Association on September 25, 1889, after the Great Seattle Fire destroyed 120 acres (49 ha) of the central business district of Seattle. The newly formed company made its first home mortgage loan on the West Coast on February 10, 1890. It changed its name to Washington Savings and Loan Association on June 25, 1908.[2] By September 12, 1917 it was operating under the name Washington Mutual Savings Bank.[23] The company purchased its first company, the financially distressed Continental Mutual Savings Bank, on July 25, 1930.[2] Its marketing slogan for much of its history was "The Friend of the Family".
Post demutualization growth[edit]
In April 1982, Washington Mutual purchased the brokerage firm Murphey Favre for undisclosed amount in cash[24] and demutualized the following year, converting into a capital stock savings bank.[25] Stock in the capital stock savings bank was first offered for sale on March 11, 1983.[26] By 1989, its assets had doubled.[2]
In November 1994, Washington Mutual formed a new holding called Washington Mutual, Inc. and separated its non-banking units from its primary banking unit, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, which was simultaneously renamed Washington Mutual Bank.[27][28][29] The company's stock continued to trade on Nasdaq under WAMU.
In October 2005, Washington Mutual purchased the formerly "subprime" credit card issuer Providian for approximately $6.5 billion, although Providian's new management team's strategy of targeting Prime credit card consumers had been underway since 2001, therefore the credit card unit's nonperforming loan portfolio had improved significantly prior to the company's sale to WaMu. In March 2006, Washington Mutual began the move into its new headquarters, WaMu Center, located in downtown Seattle. The company's previous headquarters, Washington Mutual Tower, stands about a block away from the new building on Second Avenue. In August 2006, Washington Mutual began using the official abbreviation of WaMu in all but legal situations.
Acquisitions[edit]

After the acquisition of Murphey Favre, WaMu made numerous acquisitions with the aim of expanding the corporation. By acquiring companies including PNC Mortgage, Fleet Mortgage and Homeside Lending, WaMu became the third-largest mortgage lender in the U.S. With the acquisition of Providian Financial Corporation in October 2005, WaMu became the nation's 9th-largest credit-card company.
A partial list of Washington Mutual acquisitions since demutualization:[30]

Commercial Capital Bancorp, California, 2006
Providian Financial Corporation, California, 2005
HomeSide Lending, Inc., Florida, a unit of National Australia Bank, 2002
Fleet Mortgage Corp., South Carolina, 2001
PNC Mortgage, Illinois, 2001
Alta Residential Mortgage Trust, California, 2000
Long Beach Financial Corp., California, 1999


Many of Washington Mutual's acquisitions became reviled as the rapid post-merger integrations resulted in numerous errors. The purchase of the original PNC Mortgage came at a time when subprime lending was in a "boom" period, with PNC Financial Services believing that the market was too volatile.[31] (PNC later re-entered the mortgage market in 2009 through its acquisition of National City Corp., with no plans to re-enter subprime lending.) The Dime merger resulted in account ownership to be split with account beneficiaries. The Fleet Mortgage merger resulted in entire loans simply disappearing — being serviced, but unable to be found by customer service representatives.[citation needed]
Expansion in Washington[edit]
In April 1983, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of three branch offices from the Tacoma-based United Mutual Savings Bank for $3.25 million.[32]

In August 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Lynnwood-based Pioneer Savings Bank for $181 million in stock.[60][61][62] The acquisition by was completed in March 1993.[63]
 In October 1992, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the ailing Seattle-based Pacific First Financial Corporation with its Pacific First Bank subsidiary for $663 million from its Canada-based parent Royal Trustco. The acquisition was contingent on having Pacific First dispose of its branch offices in California and having its Canadian parent Royal Trustco assume all of Pacific First's bad loans.[64][65][66] The acquisition by was completed in April 1993.[67] At the time of the initial announcement in October 1992, Washington Mutual had 118 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Pacific First had 127 branch offices in Washington, Oregon and California. Pacific First had previously announced that it was trading its California offices for Great Western's Washington offices. As a result of the Pacific First acquisition, Washington Mutual became one of the largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits in the state of Washington, second only to Seafirst.[66]
In June 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Bellevue-based Summit Bancorp with its Summit Savings Bank subsidiary for $25 million in stock.[68] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 231 branch offices in Washington and Oregon.

Unlike the previous acquisition targets, Enterprise held a commercial bank charter and not a thrift charter.
Expansion in Oregon[edit]
In April 1991, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the 25 offices in the Portland, Oregon / Vancouver, Washington area from the ailing New York-based CrossLand Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Brooklyn Bancorp, for an undisclosed amount.[73] The acquisition by was completed in November 1991.[52] Seven of the 25 offices were located in Washington with the remainder in Oregon. As part of the transaction, CrossLand Savings closed seven offices in Oregon and three offices in Washington, leaving eleven offices in Oregon and four in Washington.[52] CrossLand had previously entered Oregon (and three other states) through the relatively recent acquisition of the troubled Utah-based Western Savings and Loan Association.[74][75][76] The CrossLand acquisition gave Washington Mutual a toe hold entry into Oregon via Portland.
As a result of the Pacific First acquisition in April 1993, Washington Mutual became the fourth largest banking institution based upon consumer deposits within the state of Oregon.[66] Originally, Pacific First grew quickly in Oregon during the late 1980s through the acquisition of troubled savings and loans.[77][78] By February 1991, Pacific First had 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift.[79] Pacific First had 71 branches in Oregon by July 1992.[80]
In April 1994, Washington Mutual announced the completed acquisition of three Portland-area offices of the failed Portland-based Far West Federal Savings Bank from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $2.2 million.[81]
In October 1995, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Coos Bay-based Western Bank for $156 million in stock.[82][83][84][85] The acquisition by was completed in February 1996.[86] Since Western Bank possessed a commercial bank charter and not a more restrictive savings & loan charter, Washington Mutual decided to allow Western Bank to keep its charter and name and to remain semi-autonomous for a while. At the time of the acquisition, Western Bank had 41 offices throughout Oregon. Five years later, Washington Mutual decided to abandon the Western Bank brand and integrate most of the former Western Bank offices into the existing Washington Mutual network in Oregon in 2001.[87][88] Due to branch overlaps between the two brands, 12 Western Bank branch offices and one Washington Mutual branch office were sold to the Klamath Falls-based Klamath First Bancorp for $33 million.[89][90]
Expansion in Idaho[edit]
In March 1994, Washington Mutual announced that they were planning to expand into the state of Idaho by building new branch offices inside Fred Meyer supermarket stores with the first three being opened in the Boise-area in July and August.[91][92][93][94]
In the following year, Washington Mutual opened a fourth Idaho location in a Moscow supermarket in February 1995.[95]
A branch office in Idaho Falls was acquired from the Utah-based United Savings Bank when Washington Mutual purchased the savings bank in January 1997.[96]
By March 2000, there were 9 locations within Idaho[97] and later 22 locations in 2008 when Chase acquired Washington Mutual.[98]
Expansion in Utah[edit]
In July 1994, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank, FSB, subsidiary for $52.1 million in stock.[99][100] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 250 branch offices in Washington and Oregon while Olympus had eight branch offices in Utah and two in Montana. The acquisition by was completed in May 1995.[101]
In March 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Ogden-based Utah Federal Savings Bank for an undisclosed amount.[102][103] At the time of the announcement, Utah Federal had five branch offices while Washington Mutual had 16 within Utah. The acquisition by was completed in December 1996 for $15.2 million.[104]
In September 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Salt Lake City-based United Western Financial Group Inc. with its United Savings Bank subsidiary for $80.3 million in cash.[105][106][107][108] At the time of the announcement, United Savings Bank had eight branch offices in Utah and one in Idaho. The acquisition by was completed in January 1997.[96]
Expansion in Montana[edit]
In May 1995, Washington Mutual acquired two branch offices in Butte as the result of the acquisition of the Utah-based Olympus Capital Corporation with its Olympus Bank FSB subsidiary. Four years later, Washington Mutual later sold the two offices to Glacier Bancorp in 1999 for an undisclosed amount and quietly left the state of Montana.[109][110]
Expansion in California[edit]
 In July 1996, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Fort Worth, Texas-based Keystone Holdings Inc. with its Irvine-based American Savings Bank subsidiary for $1.6 billion in stock.[111][112][113][114][115][116] At the time of the announcement, Washington Mutual had 317 branch offices in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana while American Savings Bank had 220 branch offices in California.[115] The acquisition by was completed in December 1996.[117][118][119][120] American kept its name after the acquisition. The result of the acquisition nearly doubled the total deposits of all Washington Mutual subsidiaries from $22 billion to $42 billion.
In February 1997, the Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial, the holding company for second largest thrift in the nation Great Western Bank, found itself the target of a hostile takeover attempt of arch-rival H. F. Ahmanson & Co., the holding company for the largest thrift in the nation Home Savings of America, that would have involved $5.8 billion worth of stock. Since the two companies had large overlapping territories, many Great Western offices would have been closed by the victor if the takeover attempt had succeeded.[121][122][123] The only way the combat a hostile takeover was to find another company, called a white knight that would allow a merger on much better terms. One such company was Washington Mutual. In March, Great Western Financial announced that it had accepted Washington Mutual's merger proposal for $6.6 billion in Washington Mutual stock.[124][125][126] Ahmanson quickly increased their bids[127] but the bids were also rejected.[128] Great Western approved the merger with Washington Mutual in June[129] and the merger was completed in July.[130][131] As part of its merger agreement, it was originally announced that Great Western offices would be allowed to keep the Great Western name and there were later discussion of converting the American Savings offices to the Great Western brand. In the end, it was felt that it was best for the company to have only one brand throughout the nation instead of multiple regional brands so it was announce in December 1997 that both Great Western and American names would be retired in favor of the Washington Mutual name.[132] The previous month, it was announced in November that 85 redundant branch offices were identified in California and were to be closed within the following year.[133][134] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 413 branch operating under various names across the country while Great Western had 416 branch offices operating in California and Florida.[135]
In March 1998, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irwindale-based H. F. Ahmanson & Company with its Home Savings of America subsidiary for approximately $10 billion in stock.[136][137][138] The acquisition by was completed in October 1998 for only $6.9 billion in stock.[139] Before the merger was complete, Washington Mutual had a total of 892 branch operating under various names (Washington Mutual, American Savings, Great Western, etc.) across the country while Home Savings had 409 branch offices operating in California and Texas.[140][141] A few days after the completion of the merger, Washington Mutual announces plans to close 161 branch offices in California.[142][143]
Expansion in Texas[edit]
Through the 1998 acquisition of Home Savings, Washington Mutual had gained 48 branch offices in Texas.
In August 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Houston-based Bank United Corporation with its 155 branch offices, all located in Texas, for $1.49 billion in stock.[144][145][146] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[147][148]
As a result of branch overlap between Bank United and Washington Mutual, 17 branch offices were closed in Texas, 10 of which were in Houston.[149] [150]
Expansion in New York[edit]
In June 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the New York City-based Dime Bancorp with its Dime Savings Bank subsidiary for $5.2 billion in cash and stock.[151][152] The acquisition by was completed in January 2002.[153] Dime had 123 branch offices in the New York City area of both New York and New Jersey.[154]
Commercial banking[edit]
With a thrift charter, there were a few things that Washington Mutual was not able to do until it was able to obtain a commercial bank charter, such as making commercial loans above a certain size. To get around this problem, Washington Mutual began to purchase commercial banks and maintain them as separate business entities. In August 1995, Washington Mutual acquired the one office Bellevue-based Enterprise Bank in Washington. A few months later, Washington Mutual acquired the 41 office Coos Bay-based Western Bank in Oregon.[86] By 2007, Enterprise was merged into Western and operated as branch of Western.[155]
After Washington Mutual expanded into California through the acquisitions of American Savings, Great Western, and Home Savings, Washington Mutual quietly acquired the one-office Industrial Bank in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles an undisclosed amount in 1999[156][157] and renamed it WM Business Bank.[156]
By 2001, Washington Mutual had 38 specialized business banking centers operating under the Western Bank name in the Northwest and the WM Business Bank name in California when they decided to exit the commercial banking market that was then dominated with the likes of Wells Fargo and Bank of America.[87]
Mortgage banking[edit]
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Washington Mutual decided to aggressively expand in the subprime mortgage lending field through the acquisition of existing mortgage companies at a time when other financial institutions were leaving.
In May 1999, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Orange, California-based Long Beach Financial Corporation with its Long Beach Mortgage Company subsidiary for $350.4 million in cash and stock.[158][159] The acquisition by was completed in October 1999.[160] Long Beach had specialized in providing subprime mortgages. Some of Long Beach's questionable business practices may have led to Washington Mutual's failure in 2008.[161]
In January 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Los Angeles-based Alta Residential Mortgage Trust for $23 million.[162]
In October 2000, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based PNC Mortgage Corporation and PNC Mortgage Securities Corporation from the PNC Financial Services Group for $605 million in cash.[163][164] The acquisition by was completed in February 2001.[165] The result of the PNC Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's third-largest lender.
In April 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Columbia, South Carolina-based Fleet Mortgage Corporation from FleetBoston Financial for $660 million in cash.[166] The acquisition by was completed in June 2001.[167] The result of the Fleet Mortgage acquisition made Washington Mutual the nation's second-largest mortgage-servicing business.
In December 2001, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Jacksonville, Florida-based HomeSide Lending, Inc. from the National Australia Bank for $1.9 billion. The agreement did not include the mortgage servicing rights and related financial hedges for the business.[168][169] The acquisition by was completed in March 2002.[170] In August 2002, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the rest of HomeSide that included the mortgage servicing rights on a mortgage portfolio worth about $131 billion for $1.3 billion in cash and the assumption of $735 million in debt.[171] The acquisition by was completed in October 2002.[172]
In July 2002, the San Mateo, California-based Bay View Capital Corporation announced the pending sale of the mortgage loan portfolio for its Bay View Bank subsidiary to Washington Mutual for a "slight premium to book value".[173] The sale by was completed in the following month.[174]
In April 2006, Washington Mutual announced the pending acquisition of the Irvine, California-based Commercial Capital Bancorp, Inc. with its Commercial Capital Bank FSB subsidiary for $983 million in cash.[175][176] The acquisition by was completed in October 2006.[177] Commercial Capital had specialized in loans for the multifamily and small commercial real estate lending markets and was the third largest multifamily lender in California.
Rise and fall[edit]
"Wal-Mart of Banking"[edit]
Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger had pledged in 2003: "We hope to do to this industry what Wal-Mart did to theirs, Starbucks did to theirs, Costco did to theirs and Lowe's, Home Depot did to their industry. And I think if we’ve done our job, five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank."[178]
Killinger's goal was to build WaMu into the "Wal-Mart of Banking", which would cater to lower- and middle-class consumers that other banks deemed too risky. Complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing, a strategy the bank extended in big cities, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. WaMu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets. WaMu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than $10,000 for bringing in borrowers. Variable-rate loans — Option Adjustable Rate Mortgages (Option ARMs) in particular — were especially attractive, because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed WaMu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred. As WaMu was selling many of its loans to investors, it worried less about defaults.[9][178]
Subprime losses[edit]




The Washington Mutual Tower (center right) in downtown Seattle was Washington Mutual's corporate headquarters from 1988 until 2006, when the company moved into the new WaMu Center (center left). These buildings have since been renamed; Washington Mutual Tower is now known as 1201 Third Avenue and WaMu Center is now known as Russell Investments Center.


In December 2007, the subsidiary Washington Mutual Bank reorganized its home-loan division, closing 160 of its 336 home-loan offices and removing 2,600 positions in its home-loan staff (a 22% reduction).[179]
In March 2008, on the same weekend that JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon negotiated the takeover of Bear Stearns, he secretly dispatched members of his team to Seattle to meet with WaMu executives, urging them to consider a quick deal. However, WaMu Chairman and CEO Kerry Killinger rejected JPMorgan Chase's offer that valued WaMu at $8 a share, mostly in stock.[9][178]
In April 2008, the holding company, responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis, announced that 3,000 people companywide would lose their jobs, and the company stated its intent to close its approximately 176 remaining stand-alone, home-loan offices, including 23 in Washington and a loan-processing center in Bellevue, Washington. It stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as "wholesale lending." WaMu also announced a $7 billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by TPG Capital. TPG agreed to pump $2 billion into the Washington Mutual holding company; other investors, including some of WaMu's current institutional holders, agreed to buy an additional $5 billion in newly issued stock. This angered many investors, as TPG's investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, and as WaMu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses.[180]
In June 2008, Kerry Killinger stepped down as the Chairman, though remaining the Chief Executive Officer.[181] On September 8, 2008, under pressure from investors, the Washington Mutual holding company's board of directors dismissed Killinger as the CEO. Alan H. Fishman, chairman of mortgage broker Meridian Capital Group, and a former chief operating officer of Sovereign Bank, was named the new CEO for 17 days.[182]
Seizure by OTS and FDIC[edit]
By mid-September 2008, WaMu's share price had closed as low as $2.00. It had been worth over $30.00 in September 2007, and had briefly traded as high as $45 in the previous year.[183] While WaMu publicly insisted it could stay independent, earlier in the month it had quietly hired Goldman Sachs to identify potential bidders. However, several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid.[16] At the same time, WaMu suffered a massive run (mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfer[citation needed]); customers pulled out $16.7 billion in deposits in a ten-day span.[184]
This led the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to step up pressure for WaMu to find a buyer, as a takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) could have been a severe drain on the FDIC insurance fund, which had already been hard hit by the failure of IndyMac that year. The FDIC ultimately held a secret auction of Washington Mutual Bank. Finally, on the morning of Thursday, September 25 (which happened to be the 119th anniversary of WaMu's establishment), regulators informed JPMorgan Chase that they were the winners.[16]
On Thursday night (shortly after the close of business on the West Coast), the Office of Thrift Supervision seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC. In a statement, the OTS said that the massive run meant that WaMu was no longer sound.[184] The FDIC, as receiver, sold most of Washington Mutual Bank's assets, including the branch network, to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. JPMorgan agreed to assume the bank's secured debts and liabilities to depositors. The transaction did not require any FDIC insurance funds.[185] Normally, bank seizures take place after the close of business on Fridays. However, due to the bank's deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent, regulators felt compelled to act a day early.[16]
Because JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual's assets for a low price, WaMu's stockholders were nearly wiped out. Its stock price dropped to $0.16 a share, far from $45 a share in 2007.[183] In its Chapter 11 filing, WaMu listed assets of $33 billion and debt of $8 billion. (ref. Appendix A). The filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors.
Within days of the seizure, a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist, Mike Stathis of AVA Investment Analytics, issued a formal complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission, demonstrating evidence of insider trading. The complaint also alleged that Washington Mutual was not insolvent, and several Wall Street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock. He also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press who told him that he was contacted by a Washington Mutual executive hours before the seizure, telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons.” In later criticisms, Stathis discussed that neither the FDIC nor OTS ever disclosed any evidence of Washington Mutual's insolvency.[186] Stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint, he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning. As a result of this, Stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the SEC complaint into the public domain until a year later.[187][188]
Shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of Washington Mutual through such websites as WaMuCoup.com (dead link) and others, claiming that the OTS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of JPMorgan Chase, which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price. Shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover, the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the OTS 2 weeks earlier[189] and that the holding company's board and management was kept completely in the dark about the government's negotiations with Chase, hampering the bank's ability to sell itself on its own. Chief executive Alan H. Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed, and eventually received a $7.5 million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6 million (which he declined) after being CEO for 17 days.[190] Senator Maria Cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation[191] and Washington Mutual's former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares.[189]
The seizure of WaMu Bank resulted in the largest bank failure in American financial history, far exceeding the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984.[16][192][193]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On September 26, 2008, Washington Mutual, Inc., and its remaining subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[194] Washington Mutual, Inc., was promptly delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and commenced trading via Pink Sheets. The bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks, after the Lehman Brothers filing eleven days earlier; both bankruptcies far outpaced WorldCom's 2002 filing, which had held the record with just under $104 billion in assets (Washington Mutual's alone, which was approximately half that of Lehman Brothers, was three times as much as WorldCom's).
All assets but only some liabilities (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank were assumed by JPMorgan Chase.[195] Under the deal, JPMorgan Chase acquired all the banking operations of WaMu, including $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits, for a price of $1.9 billion plus debt assumptions.[196] Unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the FDIC, leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery.[195] On Friday, Sep. 26, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank customers were informed that Deposits held by Washington Mutual became now liabilities of JPMorgan Chase.[197]
The IRS claimed $12.5 billion in back taxes from Washington Mutual, Inc.. The company filed court papers on January 22, 2009 alleging losses were $20 billion, and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt, stating that the IRS could owe Washington Mutual Inc. a tax refund.[198] In a settlement between Wash. Mutual Inc. (in receivership), the FDIC, and JPMorgan Chase that Wash. Mutual Inc. recently made public, a tax refund of about US$5.7 billion will be shared between Wash. Mutual Inc., JPMorgan Chase and FDIC.[199]
Washington Mutual, Inc., sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for US$13 billion after the sale of its banking operations to JPMorgan Chase.[200] WMI attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank, and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken.
On January 11, 2010, the United States Department of Justice, Office of the United States Trustee, District of Delaware, pursuant to Section 1102(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, appointed a Committee of Equity Security Holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock. All of the Motions to Disband the Committee of Equity Security Holders were denied on January 28, 2010 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath, District of Delaware.[201][202]
On July 20, 2010, bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath approved a motion of the EC for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of WMI, handing a victory to shareholders. The Judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase at the heart of WaMu's reorganization, but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company.[203]
On July 26, 2010, U.S. Trustee Roberta A. DeAngelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP partner Joshua R. Hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between WMI, JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC. Hochberg is a partner in McKenna Long & Aldridge's Washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense, internal investigations and compliance.[204]
On August 10, 2010, the bankruptcy judge rejected Washington Mutual Inc.'s effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting. Attorneys for the EC said that WMI was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information. The judge agreed that WMI was not entitled to the information.[205]
On November 1, 2010, examiner Joshua R. Hochberg from McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP presented his long-awaited report, but it did not meet the expectations of the court, since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorney-client work. On December 12, the court decided to exclude the examiner's report during the plan confirmation hearings, saying it can't be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions.[206]
On January 7, 2011, the bankruptcy court rejected the 6th proposed plan of reorganization, which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Judge Mary Walrath focused many of her criticisms on the company's releases of liability granted to directors, officers and others including some hedge funds, who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement. She noted for example that shareholders, who will likely get nothing, should not have to release the company's board from the threat of being sued by them.[207] However, many WaMu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when Washington Mutual emerges from bankruptcy.
On September 14, 2011, the court also rejected the modified 6th proposed plan of reorganization. Judge Mary F. Walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt. The four hedge funds are Appaloosa Management, Aurelius Capital Management, Centerbridge Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management.[208]
A seventh plan of reorganization was announced in February 2012[209][210] and the company finally emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month as WMI Holdings Corporation.[211] By 2015, WMI Holdings was able to raise $598 million and was looking for new acquisitions.[212]
Post receivership bank operations[edit]
During 2009, all of the Washington Mutual Bank branches that had been purchased from the FDIC after the bank had been placed into receivership, were rebranded to Chase or shuttered. All financial documents issued by WaMu were changed to carry the JPMorgan Chase logo. Credit and debit cards issued by WaMu or Providian were changed to carry the Chase logo.
Since 2009, Chase ATMs have been accessible for WaMu customers at no extra charge, and the branches and accounts were formally merged in 2009 as the WaMu brand was retired.[16] Branches in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Utah were rebranded in May 2009; branches in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Illinois, and Greater New York were rebranded in July 2009, and the remaining branches in Nevada, California, Arizona, and Colorado were rebranded in October 2009.[213][214] The last rebrandings formally retired the WaMu name.
In markets where Chase already had a dominant presence, such as Greater New York and Chicago owing to the presence of Chase and predecessor Bank One (in New York, the merger resulted in different branches on the same block), Chase further disposed of such branches to other banks.[215]
Advertising campaigns[edit]
"Free Checking Account"[edit]
This advertising campaign was introduced between 2005 and 2007. Numerous WaMu commercials showed traditionally-dressed 60-70-year-old overweight bankers laughing out loud at a WaMu representative (who is much younger and fitter), who says the words "Free Checking Account".
"The Power of Yes"[edit]
WaMu introduced an advertising campaign during the 2003 Academy Awards known as “The Power of Yes”. This was to promote the offering of loans to all consumers, particularly borrowers that the banks deemed too risky. Another commercial in the ad series showed WaMu representatives in casual clothes, contrasting with traditionally-dressed bankers in suits.
"Whoo hoo"[edit]




A promotional Washington Mutual "Whoo hoo!" bumper sticker.


"Whoo hoo!" was an advertising campaign introduced by Washington Mutual in February 2008. As fears of an economic crisis were rising, and WaMu was looking to become an "iconic brand that people love", they began courting consumers with a new slogan, designed to position WaMu as a consumer-friendly institution.[216]
During its run, the Whoo hoo! ads, created by TBWA\Chiat\Day of Playa del Rey, California,[216] become widespread in web navigation.[217] After WaMu launched the new advertisement, there was double digit growth at its website[217] and the term “wamu” appeared in searches over 1,000% more between January and March than in all of 2007.[217]
Washington Mutual (before the bank's September 2008 conservatorship and sale to JPMorgan Chase) applied to register a trademark in the phrase.[218][219] Initially, the bank wanted to use "woo hoo" (without the "h" in the first word) as the slogan, but they were concerned because of the existing use of the phrase by Homer Simpson, a character in The Simpsons.[218]
Occasio branch design[edit]
Washington Mutual introduced a unique branch design known as Occasio which eliminated traditional teller windows and queuing stanchions in favor of an open, circular floor plan with a greeter or "concierge" position and tellers working from behind podiums.[220][221] The Occasio design was introduced in 2000 and patented in 2004,[222] but was phased out following the JPMorgan Chase acquisition of Washington Mutual's retail banking operations.[223]

Washington Mutual has 50 branches. Shoreline operates 15 branches, Columbia Federal has 12. An earlier agreement in which Shoreline would sell three branches to Washington Mutual was vetoed by regulators, ostensibly because it would have further weakened the ailing institution.

In one of the Pacific Northwest's biggest financial transactions of its kind, Washington Mutual Savings Bank said today it won the sweepstakes to take control of Pacific First Financial Corp., parent company to Pacific First Bank. The move will make Washington Mutual the second-largest financial institution in Washington and give it a huge initial presence in Oregon. Washington Mutual said it will pay $663 million for the rival institution - both have Seattle headquarters. After the deal is done next May or June, Washington Mutual will be second in size here only to Seafirst Bank. Just three years ago, then publicly held Pacific First was acquired by Royal Trustco of Toronto, Canada, for $212 million. But since then, Royal Trustco has run into problems elsewhere, and decided to abandon its strategy to string branches along the West Coast of the United States. It put Pacific First up for bid. 
^ "Washington Mutual buying Pacific First". Kitsap Sun. October 27, 1992. Washington Mutual Savings Bank has signed a definitive agreement to buy Pacific First Bank from Canada's Royal Trustco Ltd. for $663 million, the companies announced today. Washington Mutual will acquire Pacific First Financial Corp., the holding company for the federal savings bank, from RT Holdings Inc., a subsidiary of Royal Trustco. After approval by regulators, the deal is expected to close in mid 1993. 
^ a b c Virgin, Bill (October 28, 1992). "Washington Mutual Plans to Buy Pacific First Bank". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. p. B5. (Subscription required (help)). Washington Mutual Savings Bank will buy Pacific First Bank in a deal that cements its position as one of the three leading financial institutions in the Pacific Northwest. It also brings to a somewhat messy and expensive end a foray into the American banking market by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, parent of Pacific First. While Royal Trustco is giving up its dream of building an American banking empire anchored in Seattle, it will be stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate loans that are in default or heading that way. And the $663 million acquisition of Pacific First Financial Corp. marks the third major upheaval of banking in Washington in a year, which will mean more sign changes, building closures and potential layoffs for employees. Washington Mutual already has $8.4 billion in assets and 118 branches and 17 loan centers in Washington and Oregon. Pacific First has assets of $6.9 billion, 127 branches in Washington, Oregon and California and eight mortgage offices. It previously agreed to trade its 10 California branches for Great Western Bank's 14 Washington branches. Once the Pacific First deal is completed, Washington Mutual will have assets of about $14 billion... Pacific First is merely the latest in a series of acquisitions Washington Mutual has made in the last few years, including Pioneer Savings in Lynnwood, Great Northwest in Bremerton and VanFed in Vancouver. With Pacific First's branches, Washington Mutual's share of consumer deposits in Washington will be 17.2 percent, ahead of KeyCorp-Puget Sound with 10.3 percent and trailing only Seafirst at 20.4 percent, Tejera said. In Oregon, Washington Mutual will become the fourth biggest in consumer deposits.

Federal regulators Thursday announced the acquisition of insolvent savings and loans in Salem and Vancouver, Wash., by Pacific First Financial Corp. of Tacoma. The insolvent institutions are American Home Savings Bank of Salem and Community First Federal Savings. Both have been under federal supervision for more than a year and have substantial negative net worth. The two thrifts were closed by regulators Thursday and will open under Pacific First ownership Friday where business will be conducted without interruption. The institutions were acquired through a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific First Federal Savings Bank and will be operated as Pacific First Bank... The twin acquisition will expand Pacific First's operations in Oregon and the Portland market. It already has 11 branches in Portland and Eugene, and it will pick up nine more from Community in the Portland area and 17 American Home offices in the mid-Willamette Valley. It will also get seven Community branches in the Vancouver area.

^ MacKenzie, Bill (February 22, 1991). "Pacific First Tops Oregon Thrifts". The Oregonian. p. E15. (Subscription required (help)). Pacific First Bank, a Seattle-based thrift, has quietly become the largest holder of deposits among all thrifts operating in Oregon. It also operates 78 branches in Oregon, more than any other thrift. Its rise has been due, in part, to turmoil in the thrift industry that has led to deposit declines at competitors and the shift of one large thrift to a bank. Pacific First had $1.1 billion in deposits at its Oregon branches at the end of 1989. A year later, deposits had grown to $2.3 billion. It now holds about 27 percent of the thrift market in Oregon and about 9 percent of the combined thrift and bank market. The next-largest Oregon thrift is Far West Federal Bank with $1.3 billion in deposits... Pacific First has been serving Oregonians since 1936, but it had only a few branches until December 1988, when it bought 17 branches of Salem-based American Home Savings. One year later the thrift was acquired by Toronto, Canada-based Royal Trustco, Canada's largest trust company, which injected $100 million of capital into the thrift and set it on an aggressive expansion course. Pacific First acquired the 45 branches of Willamette Savings and Loan in June and added the 12 Oregon branches of the Williamsburg Federal Savings and Loan Association in September. Some recently acquired branches have been closed, leaving the thrift with 78 Oregon branches spread throughout the state, but principally in the Portland metropolitan area and the Willamette Valley.

Western Bank has 41 offices in 33 Oregon communities, so the acquisition will add to Washington Mutual's 72 branches in that state. It also adds 20 towns Washington Mutual isn't already in. Washington Mutual is already the leading residential real estate lender in Oregon. But the deal also increases Washington Mutual's reach into the commercial banking market. Washington Mutual has traditionally emphasized the thrift business, which means home mortgage and consumer loans. Western, being a commercial bank, focuses on lending to small- and medium-sized businesses. Commercial banking is a business Washington Mutual has been increasingly interested in. Last month it wrapped up a deal to acquire the 90 percent of Bellevue's Enterprise Bank it didn't already own.

In an acquisition that will virtually double the size of the savings bank the day it is completed, Seattle-based Washington Mutual said it will acquire Keystone Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary, American Savings Bank of Irvine, Calif., in a stock deal worth about $1.4 billion, based on yesterday's closing price... In addition, because American's loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward adjustable rate mortgages, the acquisition helps Washington Mutual reduce its vulnerability to interest rate swings... The third attraction for investors is the presence of billionaire investor Robert Bass, who bought into American Savings when it was taken over by the government and reorganized in 1988. He assures me he has totally bought into the business plan. We believe he will be a good long-term shareholder, Killinger said of Bass. Bass will name two additional members to Washington Mutual's board, although Killinger said it's not likely Bass himself will serve... Washington Mutual, already at $22 million in assets, will grow to more than $42 million. It already operates 248 branches in Washington, Oregon, Utah, Idaho and Montana.

Washington Mutual Inc., a Seattle financial services firm, said Monday it will buy American Savings Bank and its parent company in a stock for stock transaction worth $3.5 billion. Irvine-based American Savings Bank will keep its name, and officials said they expect all branches to remain open, officials said... Washington Mutual, which owns a network of banks, is the No. 1 residential mortgage originator in Washington and Oregon. American Savings is California's second largest home-mortgage originator. The deal gives Washington Mutual its first presence in California, allowing an immediate foothold in key locations that will solidify its West Coast position... Robert M. Bass and his investor group control Keystone Holdings Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, the parent company of American Savings. After the acquisition, Keystone will be merged into Washington Mutual. The investor group will get 26 million of the 48 million shares to be issued by Washington Mutual in the merger. With total outstanding shares of 117.5 million, the group's share amounts to a 22 percent ownership in the new company, with Bass holding an 8 percent stake. About 14 million of the new shares will go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which will sell them after the merger. The rest will be held in escrow pending the outcome of a Keystone lawsuit against the federal government. Washington Mutual also will assume Keystone's $365 million of debt and $80 million in outstanding preferred stock. Mario Antoci, American Savings' chairman and CEO, will retire after the deal closes. Post-merger management changes have not been finalized. Antoci took over American Savings in 1988, when the Bass Group bought it. American Savings Bank was originally part of American Savings and Loan, a failed thrift that led to the largest savings and loan bailout in history. The original thrift was divided into two parts: American Savings Bank controlled the profitable assets and loans while the other unit was liquidated. American Savings Bank has 220 branches in California and Arizona. Washington Mutual has 317 branches in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Montana.

An investment group led by Fort Worth billionaire Robert M. Bass cashed in on a $400 million investment in California's American Savings yesterday, selling the thrift it acquired less than eight years ago. The deal was valued at more than $1.6 billion. Washington Mutual Inc., the parent of one of Washington state's largest savings banks, agreed to acquire the thrift for at least 40 million shares of Washington Mutual stock. That stock was worth slightly more than $1.2 billion at Friday's closing price. Washington Mutual will also assume $465 million in debt as part of the deal... Bass made his investment through Keystone Holdings, in which he owns about 36 percent. In 1988, Keystone acquired American Savings from the federal government, which had seized the thrift in 1984. Keystone invested $350 million in cash into American Savings and spent another $50 million in expenses to buy the institution, which at the time was America's biggest insolvent thrift. Keystone installed Mario J. Antoci, a respected thrift executive, to run American Savings. The thrift, stripped of its most troubled assets, immediately started making money... The Keystone group will also name two members of Washington Mutual's 13-person board, suggesting that the group is likely to retain its interest in the company.

On the negative side, Washington Mutual is currently digesting a major California acquisition, a hurry-up deal wouldn't give it time to carefully review the transaction, it wouldn't get the same cost savings Ahmanson would to make the deal attractive, and a bidding war could become expensive.

Washington Mutual Inc., looking to make itself as much a major player in Texas banking as it is in Washington and California, yesterday said it will buy a Houston-based company in a $1.5 billion stock deal. Seattle-based Washington Mutual will acquire Bank United Corp., the largest publicly traded Texas-based financial institution. Texas was something of an incidental market Washington Mutual picked up in its 1998 acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson & Co.; while the real prize in the Ahmanson deal was its huge share of the market in California, it also had 48 branches in Texas, primarily in Houston and Dallas... Bank United will provide that, with 155 branches, including 66 in Houston, 77 in Dallas-Fort Worth and a handful in Midland, Austin and San Antonio. 
^ Fuquay, Jim (August 22, 2000). "Bank United says yes to buyout - Washington Mutual to pay $1.5 billion in merger deal". Fort Worth Star-Telegram. p. 1. (Subscription required (help)). Bank United, the largest financial institution based in Texas, said yesterday that it agreed to be acquired by Washington Mutual, the nation's biggest savings and loan. The deal, valued at $1.5 billion and expected to close by year's end, will greatly increase Washington Mutual's presence in the state. The Seattle-based institution entered Texas in 1998 with its acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson & Co., parent of Savings of America, and the Bank United merger will give it 3 percent of Texas deposits, according to June 30, 1999, reports, the latest available. Washington Mutual, which ranks No. 8 among all U.S. banks and thrifts, also has a previous Texas connection. In 1995, it acquired American Savings, a California thrift owned by Fort Worth investor Robert M. Bass, who became a major Washington Mutual shareholder as a result of that deal. A Bass lieutenant, Jay Crandall, remains on Washington Mutual's board of directors... Bank United has 155 retail branches in the state, including 77 in North Texas, along with 42 commercial loan offices and 11 other sales offices. Washington Mutual has 48 branches in Texas, including two in Tarrant County... About a dozen Texas branches share overlapping market areas, the companies said. That includes downtown Fort Worth, where two branches are within blocks of each other.

^ a b Virgin, Bill (January 28, 1999). "Tiny Step to A Giant Market - Washington Mutual Buys Business Bank". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. p. C1. (Subscription required (help)). It was so small a deal that Washington Mutual Inc. didn't even bother putting out an announcement about it. For a company with $166 billion in assets and offices from coast to coast, the acquisition of Industrial Bank of Van Nuys, Calif., which has one office and $30 million in assets, created hardly a ripple. But the significance of the acquisition was not in the numbers, or Washington Mutual wouldn't have bothered making it. For Washington Mutual, Industrial Bank is a way to boost its often overlooked but growing commercial banking business in California.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        LendingTree, LLC has received 4.26 out of 5 stars based on 100 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

WASHINGTON MUTUAL MORTGAGE SECURITIES CORP - 8-K - 20030619 - DISCLOSURE






	Item 9. Regulation FD
	Disclosure.






	On June 19, 2003, Michael Aaknes, First Vice President and Cathe Lewis, First Vice President of Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp.
	will make the following presentation to investors at CSFB Private Label Investor Conference:








	Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp.

	Michael Aaknes

	First Vice President

	Structured Finance









	Forward-Looking Statements

	This presentation contains
	forward-looking statements, which are not historical facts and pertain to future
	operating results. These forward-looking statements are within the meaning of the Private
	Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, but
	are not limited to, statements about our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions
	and other statements contained in this document that are not historical facts. When used
	in this presentation, the words expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes,seeks, estimates, or
	words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as will, would,should, could, or
	may are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. These
	forward-looking statements are inherently subject to significant business, economic and
	competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In
	addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to
	future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. Actual results may
	differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements for the
	reasons, among others, discussed under the heading Business-Factors That May Affect
	Future Results in Washington Mutual´s 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K and under the
	heading, Cautionary Statements, in Washington Mutual´s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
	for the period ended September 30, 2002, which include: changes in general business and
	economic conditions may significantly affect our earnings; the risk that our inability to
	effectively manage the volatility of our mortgage banking business could adversely affect
	our earnings; the risk that the impact of rising interest rates may result in an increase
	in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, which could outpace the increase in the
	yield on interest-earning assets and lead to a reduction in the net interest margin,
	along with the potential decreases in mortgage loan volumes and a corresponding reduction
	in gain from mortgage loans; the impact of falling interest rates may accelerate mortgage
	prepayment rates, which would increase the impairment on mortgage servicing rights (MSR)
	and may result in balance sheet shrinkage causing a potential reduction in net interest
	income; the risk that our inability to effectively integrate the operations and personnel
	of companies we have acquired could adversely affect our earnings and financial
	condition; the concentration of operations in California could adversely affect our
	operating results if the California economy or real estate market declines; competition
	from other financial services companies in our markets could adversely affect our ability
	to achieve our financial goals; changes in the regulation of financial services companies
	could adversely affect our business.





	Business Segment Financial
	Information

	Business Segment Financial Information Business segment financial information
	is prepared for management information purposes and uses methodologies which do not
	conform to generally accepted accounting principles. These methodologies include internal
	allocations of the cost of funds, hedge gains or losses, loan loss provisions and certain
	overhead items.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
