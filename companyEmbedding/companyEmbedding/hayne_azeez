SAMPLE LEGAL CASES



Working with Web Hosts & Designers

                    No matter how averse you are to "techie" projects like web development and site management, you must be involved enough to ensure your rights are protected--and that no one else's are being violated.  This reference discusses how.
                




Estate Planning Proceedures

                    Proper estate planning can be more involved than you might imagine, but is essential to the proper management of your affairs.  This reference provides a list of the various tasks involved in doing just that.
