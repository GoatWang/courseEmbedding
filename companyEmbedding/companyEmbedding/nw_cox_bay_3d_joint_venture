Of Counsel

Washington Office

TEL: +1 202 429 8139FAX: +1 202 429 3902Jeffrey Theodore, of counsel in Steptoe’s Washington office, represents domestic and international clients on both the plaintiff and defense sides of complex commercial and intellectual property disputes.  He has been recognized as a “Rising Star” in business litigation by Super Lawyers in 2013, 2014, and 2015. 
Mr. Theodore was trial counsel for BMG in a suit that held Cox Communications liable for its high-speed internet subscribers’ online sharing of copyrighted music files.  Mr. Theodore briefed and argued the summary judgment motion that stripped Cox Communications of its Digital Millennium Copyright Act “safe harbor” defense to contributory copyright infringement liability – the first time a cable internet provider had ever lost its DMCA “safe harbor.”  Ultimately, Steptoe’s trial team obtained a $25 million jury verdict. 
Mr. Theodore has argued appeals in federal and state appellate courts, has direct- and cross-examined witnesses, and has experience before many different arbitral bodies.  He has extensive experience in contractual and other commercial disputes and in patent infringement, copyright infringement, and misappropriation of trade secrets cases.  Mr. Theodore also has significant experience litigating constitutional claims under the Contract Clause, Commerce Clause, Takings Clause, and Due Process Clause.  
Mr. Theodore is active in pro bono matters that range from representing death row inmates to advising the Children’s Defense Fund on child healthcare legislation.  In Renchenski v. Williams, 622 F.3d 315 (3d Cir. 2010), Mr. Theodore represented a prison inmate on appeal after his suit against prison officials was dismissed by the district court.  Mr. Theodore’s victory in the Third Circuit made new law protecting prisoners’ rights under the Due Process Clause and established new procedures to ensure that pro se prisoner plaintiffs have an adequate opportunity to take discovery.  
Representative Matters
Domestic Commercial Litigation

Obtained take-nothing dismissal of a class action where the same plaintiffs had obtained settlements worth hundreds of millions of dollars from competitors in the industry in companion suits premised on identical allegations. 
On behalf of a major frozen dessert manufacturer, defeated an investment fund’s claim for over $65 million in damages arising out of a failed joint venture. 
Obtained, defended on appeal, and enforced an eight figure judgment arising from the breach of residential real estate guaranty obligations during the financial crisis. 
Represented a specialty insurer in an action against former officers and directors for breach of their obligations to the company. 
Obtained appellate reversal of a $35 million insurance coverage judgment and a ruling with favorable implications for the interpretation of additional insurance policies by developing and presenting arguments regarding the proper scientific understanding of language relating to floodplains, flood hazard, and flood risk.  

Intellectual Property Litigation

Obtained a $25 million jury verdict in ground-breaking suit to hold a leading cable internet service provider liable for contributory copyright infringement after it refused to prevent its subscribers from sharing our client’s music online. 
Represented a leading, international semiconductor manufacturer in what the plaintiff described as the largest trade secret misappropriation case in California history. 
Represented a major international heavy industrial conglomerate in multi-jurisdictional battle, involving multiple patent infringement suits, Walker Process antitrust litigation, and ITC proceedings over wind turbine patents. 
Represented a major international chemical company in multiple suits to enforce patents protecting agricultural products and methods. 

International Arbitration and Cross-Border Litigation

Obtained a $60 million arbitration award against a major French bank in a dispute over the interpretation of a hedge fund-linked, financial derivative.  Described as a “top plaintiff verdict of 2011,” the award was one of the top ten largest securities arbitration awards at the time it was issued. 
Represented a “supermajor” oil and gas company in its worldwide effort to obtain and enforce ICC and ICSID awards arising from the nationalization of its stake in an oil extraction venture.  The Steptoe team obtained a series of pre-award attachment and freezing orders around the world, including $300 million in New York bank accounts that were used to satisfy an eventual judgment.

North West Shelf Venture leases and infrastructure


The North West Shelf Venture, situated in the north-west of Western Australia, is Australia's largest resource development project. It involves the extraction of petroleum (mostly natural gas and condensate) at offshore production platforms, onshore processing and export of liquefied natural gas, and production of natural gas for industrial, commercial and domestic use within the state.

Project[edit]
With investments totalling $25 billion since the early 1980s, the project is the largest resource development in Australian history.[1] In the late 1980s, it was the largest engineering project in the world.[2] The Venture is underpinned by huge hydrocarbon reserves within the Carnarvon Basin, with only about one-third of the Venture's estimated total reserves of 33 trillion cubic feet (930 km3) of gas produced to date.
Owned by an international consortium, the venture is composed of six partners each holding a one-sixth share in the project. These are: Perth-based Woodside Petroleum; BHP Billiton; BP plc; Chevron Corporation; Royal Dutch Shell plc (which also own 24% of Woodside through Shell Australia); a venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co. called Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty Ltd. North West Shelf Gas Pty Ltd.[3] has a stake in the domestic gas phase of the project. Along with being a joint venture partner, Woodside is also the project operator on behalf of the other participants.
Assets[edit]
The venture currently has three currently active offshore facilities. A fourth, North Rankin B is under construction:

North Rankin A (NRA)


Commissioned in 1984, North Rankin A was the then-largest gas production platform in the world, capable of producing 1,815 million cubic feet (51,400,000 m³) of gas per day and up to 47,400 barrels per day (7,540 m3/d) of condensate. Modifications have increased the facility's capacity by 50% and it remains one of the world's largest gas platforms.[4]
It is located 135 km north-west of Karratha and can accommodate more than 120 people. It services 25 production wells in the North Rankin and Perseus fields.


Goodwyn A (GWA)


At a cost of $2bn, the platform was, when commissioned in early 1995, the largest single offshore oil and gas investment ever made in Australia.
In late 2001, the Goodwyn platform was linked to the Echo/Yodel gas and condensate fields via a 23 km 12-inch (300 mm) pipeline. Hydrocarbons from the Goodwyn field are transferred via a subsea pipeline to North Rankin before being transported to Karratha for processing. It is designed for up to 30 production wells (19 currently), including five re-injection wells. It accommodates 137 people.
It has a production capacity of 32,000 tonnes of gas per day.


Cossack Pioneer Floating Production Storage and Off-Loading (FPSO)


The facility was commissioned in late 1995 and produces up to 50,000 barrels per day (7,900 m3/d)[5] of crude oil which is offloaded via a flexible line to oil tankers moored astern. Located 34 km east of the North Rankin A platform, it is moored to a riser turret which is connected by flexible flowlines to subsea production wells at the Wanaea, Cossack, Lambert and Hermeson gas fields.
It has a storage capacity of 1.15 million barrels (183,000 m3) of oil and a production capacity of 150,000 barrels (24,000 m3) of oil per day.
In May 2008, Woodside announced plans to replace the 13-year-old vessel with a view to extending oil output to 2025-2030.[5]

The condensate is transported to the Burrup Peninsula (Murujuga) onshore facility on the mainland 130 km away by two 42-inch (1.1 m) and 40-inch (1.0 m) undersea pipes.
Other assets include:

LNG and condensate loading facilities at Withnell Bay at Karratha including jetties, LNG storage tanks and other infrastructure, and supported by Dampier Port Authority.[6]


Karratha gas plant. In 2008, the facility capacity was increased to 16.3 million tonnes per year with the commissioning of a fifth, 4.4 million tonnes per year LNG production train. As well as processing gas for export, the facility supplies domestic supplies to consumers and businesses in Western Australia. The facility also processes condensate which is extracted from the gaseous hydrocarbons during processing.
A fleet of nine purpose built LNG cargo ships. The ships are powered using gas vapour from the storage tanks on board which is used to run steam turbines. Each of the ships is equipped with four spherical tanks giving a total capacity of 125,000 cubic metres (138,500 cubic metres in the case of the most recently delivered Northwest Swan) and utilise docking facilities at the Karratha gas plant's Withnell Bay terminal. A subsidiary company, North West Shelf Shipping Service Company Pty Ltd manages the shipping operations.

In March 2008, the partners approved a A$5 billion North Rankin 2 project which will underpin supply commitments to customers in Asia beyond 2013.[5] The project will recover remaining low pressure gas from the ageing North Rankin and Perseus gas fields using compression. It will include the installation of a new platform (North Rankin B) which will stand in about 125 metres of water and will be connected by a 100-metre bridge to the existing North Rankin A platform.[7]
Production and sales[edit]
The first LNG shipments went to Japan in 1989. 200 shipments per year (about one shipment every 1.5 days) in the purpose built LNG carriers totalling more than seven million tons are made around the world. Markets include sales to long term customers in Japan and spot buyers in China, Spain, South Korea and the United States.[8]
To date, the venture has produced more than 1000 cargoes of light crude oil (natural gas condensate). Condensate is sold on the international energy market.
The venture is Western Australia's largest single producer of domestic gas providing about 65% of total State production.[1] Pipeline gas is processed at the consortium's Karratha facility, and transported to customers in southern Western Australia via the 1530 km Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline. A subsidiary company, North West Shelf Gas Pty Ltd markets the domestic gas component to customers in Western Australia through private contracts and sales to AlintaGas.[9]

North West Shelf Venture leases and infrastructure


The North West Shelf Venture, situated in the north-west of Western Australia, is Australia's largest resource development project. It involves the extraction of petroleum (mostly natural gas and condensate) at offshore production platforms, onshore processing and export of liquefied natural gas, and production of natural gas for industrial, commercial and domestic use within the state.

Project[edit]
With investments totalling $25 billion since the early 1980s, the project is the largest resource development in Australian history.[1] In the late 1980s, it was the largest engineering project in the world.[2] The Venture is underpinned by huge hydrocarbon reserves within the Carnarvon Basin, with only about one-third of the Venture's estimated total reserves of 33 trillion cubic feet (930 km3) of gas produced to date.
Owned by an international consortium, the venture is composed of six partners each holding a one-sixth share in the project. These are: Perth-based Woodside Petroleum; BHP Billiton; BP plc; Chevron Corporation; Royal Dutch Shell plc (which also own 24% of Woodside through Shell Australia); a venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co. called Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty Ltd. North West Shelf Gas Pty Ltd.[3] has a stake in the domestic gas phase of the project. Along with being a joint venture partner, Woodside is also the project operator on behalf of the other participants.
Assets[edit]
The venture currently has three currently active offshore facilities. A fourth, North Rankin B is under construction:

North Rankin A (NRA)


Commissioned in 1984, North Rankin A was the then-largest gas production platform in the world, capable of producing 1,815 million cubic feet (51,400,000 m³) of gas per day and up to 47,400 barrels per day (7,540 m3/d) of condensate. Modifications have increased the facility's capacity by 50% and it remains one of the world's largest gas platforms.[4]
It is located 135 km north-west of Karratha and can accommodate more than 120 people. It services 25 production wells in the North Rankin and Perseus fields.


Goodwyn A (GWA)


At a cost of $2bn, the platform was, when commissioned in early 1995, the largest single offshore oil and gas investment ever made in Australia.
In late 2001, the Goodwyn platform was linked to the Echo/Yodel gas and condensate fields via a 23 km 12-inch (300 mm) pipeline. Hydrocarbons from the Goodwyn field are transferred via a subsea pipeline to North Rankin before being transported to Karratha for processing. It is designed for up to 30 production wells (19 currently), including five re-injection wells. It accommodates 137 people.
It has a production capacity of 32,000 tonnes of gas per day.


Cossack Pioneer Floating Production Storage and Off-Loading (FPSO)


The facility was commissioned in late 1995 and produces up to 50,000 barrels per day (7,900 m3/d)[5] of crude oil which is offloaded via a flexible line to oil tankers moored astern. Located 34 km east of the North Rankin A platform, it is moored to a riser turret which is connected by flexible flowlines to subsea production wells at the Wanaea, Cossack, Lambert and Hermeson gas fields.
It has a storage capacity of 1.15 million barrels (183,000 m3) of oil and a production capacity of 150,000 barrels (24,000 m3) of oil per day.
In May 2008, Woodside announced plans to replace the 13-year-old vessel with a view to extending oil output to 2025-2030.[5]

The condensate is transported to the Burrup Peninsula (Murujuga) onshore facility on the mainland 130 km away by two 42-inch (1.1 m) and 40-inch (1.0 m) undersea pipes.
Other assets include:

LNG and condensate loading facilities at Withnell Bay at Karratha including jetties, LNG storage tanks and other infrastructure, and supported by Dampier Port Authority.[6]


Karratha gas plant. In 2008, the facility capacity was increased to 16.3 million tonnes per year with the commissioning of a fifth, 4.4 million tonnes per year LNG production train. As well as processing gas for export, the facility supplies domestic supplies to consumers and businesses in Western Australia. The facility also processes condensate which is extracted from the gaseous hydrocarbons during processing.
A fleet of nine purpose built LNG cargo ships. The ships are powered using gas vapour from the storage tanks on board which is used to run steam turbines. Each of the ships is equipped with four spherical tanks giving a total capacity of 125,000 cubic metres (138,500 cubic metres in the case of the most recently delivered Northwest Swan) and utilise docking facilities at the Karratha gas plant's Withnell Bay terminal. A subsidiary company, North West Shelf Shipping Service Company Pty Ltd manages the shipping operations.

In March 2008, the partners approved a A$5 billion North Rankin 2 project which will underpin supply commitments to customers in Asia beyond 2013.[5] The project will recover remaining low pressure gas from the ageing North Rankin and Perseus gas fields using compression. It will include the installation of a new platform (North Rankin B) which will stand in about 125 metres of water and will be connected by a 100-metre bridge to the existing North Rankin A platform.[7]
Production and sales[edit]
The first LNG shipments went to Japan in 1989. 200 shipments per year (about one shipment every 1.5 days) in the purpose built LNG carriers totalling more than seven million tons are made around the world. Markets include sales to long term customers in Japan and spot buyers in China, Spain, South Korea and the United States.[8]
To date, the venture has produced more than 1000 cargoes of light crude oil (natural gas condensate). Condensate is sold on the international energy market.
The venture is Western Australia's largest single producer of domestic gas providing about 65% of total State production.[1] Pipeline gas is processed at the consortium's Karratha facility, and transported to customers in southern Western Australia via the 1530 km Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline. A subsidiary company, North West Shelf Gas Pty Ltd markets the domestic gas component to customers in Western Australia through private contracts and sales to AlintaGas.[9]

LNG and condensate loading facilities at Withnell Bay at Karratha including jetties, LNG storage tanks and other infrastructure, and supported by Dampier Port Authority.[6]


Karratha gas plant. In 2008, the facility capacity was increased to 16.3 million tonnes per year with the commissioning of a fifth, 4.4 million tonnes per year LNG production train. As well as processing gas for export, the facility supplies domestic supplies to consumers and businesses in Western Australia. The facility also processes condensate which is extracted from the gaseous hydrocarbons during processing.
A fleet of nine purpose built LNG cargo ships. The ships are powered using gas vapour from the storage tanks on board which is used to run steam turbines. Each of the ships is equipped with four spherical tanks giving a total capacity of 125,000 cubic metres (138,500 cubic metres in the case of the most recently delivered Northwest Swan) and utilise docking facilities at the Karratha gas plant's Withnell Bay terminal. A subsidiary company, North West Shelf Shipping Service Company Pty Ltd manages the shipping operations.

In March 2008, the partners approved a A$5 billion North Rankin 2 project which will underpin supply commitments to customers in Asia beyond 2013.[5] The project will recover remaining low pressure gas from the ageing North Rankin and Perseus gas fields using compression. It will include the installation of a new platform (North Rankin B) which will stand in about 125 metres of water and will be connected by a 100-metre bridge to the existing North Rankin A platform.[7]
Production and sales[edit]
The first LNG shipments went to Japan in 1989. 200 shipments per year (about one shipment every 1.5 days) in the purpose built LNG carriers totalling more than seven million tons are made around the world. Markets include sales to long term customers in Japan and spot buyers in China, Spain, South Korea and the United States.[8]
To date, the venture has produced more than 1000 cargoes of light crude oil (natural gas condensate). Condensate is sold on the international energy market.
The venture is Western Australia's largest single producer of domestic gas providing about 65% of total State production.[1] Pipeline gas is processed at the consortium's Karratha facility, and transported to customers in southern Western Australia via the 1530 km Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline. A subsidiary company, North West Shelf Gas Pty Ltd markets the domestic gas component to customers in Western Australia through private contracts and sales to AlintaGas.[9]

North West Shelf Venture leases and infrastructure


The North West Shelf Venture, situated in the north-west of Western Australia, is Australia's largest resource development project. It involves the extraction of petroleum (mostly natural gas and condensate) at offshore production platforms, onshore processing and export of liquefied natural gas, and production of natural gas for industrial, commercial and domestic use within the state.

Project[edit]
With investments totalling $25 billion since the early 1980s, the project is the largest resource development in Australian history.[1] In the late 1980s, it was the largest engineering project in the world.[2] The Venture is underpinned by huge hydrocarbon reserves within the Carnarvon Basin, with only about one-third of the Venture's estimated total reserves of 33 trillion cubic feet (930 km3) of gas produced to date.
Owned by an international consortium, the venture is composed of six partners each holding a one-sixth share in the project. These are: Perth-based Woodside Petroleum; BHP Billiton; BP plc; Chevron Corporation; Royal Dutch Shell plc (which also own 24% of Woodside through Shell Australia); a venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co. called Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty Ltd. North West Shelf Gas Pty Ltd.[3] has a stake in the domestic gas phase of the project. Along with being a joint venture partner, Woodside is also the project operator on behalf of the other participants.
Assets[edit]
The venture currently has three currently active offshore facilities. A fourth, North Rankin B is under construction:

North Rankin A (NRA)


Commissioned in 1984, North Rankin A was the then-largest gas production platform in the world, capable of producing 1,815 million cubic feet (51,400,000 m³) of gas per day and up to 47,400 barrels per day (7,540 m3/d) of condensate. Modifications have increased the facility's capacity by 50% and it remains one of the world's largest gas platforms.[4]
It is located 135 km north-west of Karratha and can accommodate more than 120 people. It services 25 production wells in the North Rankin and Perseus fields.


Goodwyn A (GWA)


At a cost of $2bn, the platform was, when commissioned in early 1995, the largest single offshore oil and gas investment ever made in Australia.
In late 2001, the Goodwyn platform was linked to the Echo/Yodel gas and condensate fields via a 23 km 12-inch (300 mm) pipeline. Hydrocarbons from the Goodwyn field are transferred via a subsea pipeline to North Rankin before being transported to Karratha for processing. It is designed for up to 30 production wells (19 currently), including five re-injection wells. It accommodates 137 people.
It has a production capacity of 32,000 tonnes of gas per day.


Cossack Pioneer Floating Production Storage and Off-Loading (FPSO)


The facility was commissioned in late 1995 and produces up to 50,000 barrels per day (7,900 m3/d)[5] of crude oil which is offloaded via a flexible line to oil tankers moored astern. Located 34 km east of the North Rankin A platform, it is moored to a riser turret which is connected by flexible flowlines to subsea production wells at the Wanaea, Cossack, Lambert and Hermeson gas fields.
It has a storage capacity of 1.15 million barrels (183,000 m3) of oil and a production capacity of 150,000 barrels (24,000 m3) of oil per day.
In May 2008, Woodside announced plans to replace the 13-year-old vessel with a view to extending oil output to 2025-2030.[5]

The condensate is transported to the Burrup Peninsula (Murujuga) onshore facility on the mainland 130 km away by two 42-inch (1.1 m) and 40-inch (1.0 m) undersea pipes.
Other assets include:

LNG and condensate loading facilities at Withnell Bay at Karratha including jetties, LNG storage tanks and other infrastructure, and supported by Dampier Port Authority.[6]


Karratha gas plant. In 2008, the facility capacity was increased to 16.3 million tonnes per year with the commissioning of a fifth, 4.4 million tonnes per year LNG production train.

The facility also processes condensate which is extracted from the gaseous hydrocarbons during processing.
A fleet of nine purpose built LNG cargo ships. The ships are powered using gas vapour from the storage tanks on board which is used to run steam turbines.

It will include the installation of a new platform (North Rankin B) which will stand in about 125 metres of water and will be connected by a 100-metre bridge to the existing North Rankin A platform.[7]

They showed fortitude as an investor and believed in the eventual opportunity to defend the world from advanced cyber attacks even when there were insufficient market proof points. I am grateful for their support in helping build FireEye into the global company it is today. Ashar Aziz, Founder, Vice Chairman of the Board, and Chief Strategy Officer - FireEye Norwest’s ability to invest against the grain in an enterprise mobility company like MobileIron speaks to the firm’s belief in its entrepreneurs and backing companies in new markets that aren’t yet obvious. MobileIron is a great example of how Norwest partners with companies to build great businesses. Bob Tinker, President & CEO - MobileIron As we built out our sales force across the United States and grew our sales over 3000% from commercialization to IPO, Norwest’s financing and guidance was critical to our success. Their partnership was and remains key during our rapid commercial growth and scaling. We would not be where we are today without them. Lisa Earnhardt, President and CEO - Intersect ENT Norwest has been championing our team since before day one. Along with Alagu, I was an Entrepreneur- in-Residence with Norwest. I know firsthand how the firm supports companies from idea to incubation to launch to growth and beyond. Matt Howard has been a tremendous part of this path for us at Blue Jeans and is available to us 24×7. Matt has brokered strategic relationships, including those that have led directly to revenue.
