Expense ratios are expressed as an annualized percentage of a fund's average net assets paid out in expenses. Net expense ratios reflect adjustments due to voluntary or contractual fee waivers or expense reimbursements. Expense ratio information is as of the Fund's current prospectus, as revised and supplemented from time to time.
