      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(7/10/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. continues to advance its Juanicipio project. . .the proposed capacity increase to 4 Ktpd should maximize value at Juanicipio. . .underground development activities have recently accelerated, primarily in order to allow for the expected increase in processing capacity at the project."
		
		









  Canaccord Genuity Morning Coffee 

(7/7/17)

		
		"As for potential near-term catalysts, MAG Silver Corp. expects to release an updated resource estimate for the Juanicipio project in Q3/17. . .the company also expects to release an updated PEA technical report that will look to capture the impact of a materially larger resource base and could also incorporate lower operating costs."
		
		









  
      Kevin MacKenzie, Canaccord Genuity
  

(7/6/17)

		
		"Due to a reallocation of analyst resources, we are transferring coverage of MAG Silver Corp. to Kevin MacKenzie. We continue to view the company as one of the premier investments within the silver developer space. . .we derive a corporate NAV for it of $24.01/share."
		
		












  
      Gwen  Preston, Resource Maven
(6/21/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Ltd.'s Juanicipio is the highest-grade precious metal deposit in development in the world. . .MAG provides strong leverage to silver, something a subset of metals investors seek because silver often outperforms gold in a bull market. . .there is fundamental upside in the stock in the medium term, as in over the next two years as Juancipio enters production and the partners outline what they plan to do with the Deep zone."


		
		









  
      Gwen  Preston, Resource Maven
(6/18/17)

		
		"I have spent a fair bit of time looking at MAG Silver Corp. recently and believe the stock is a Buy. . .I think share price weakness stemming from the GDXJ rebalance and general sector weakness following the rate hike is providing a good entry point. . .I'm a buyer of the company at the open tomorrow."

(5/30/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. is a defensive name despite being a development
company. . .MAG's 44% share of the high-grade Juanicipio project with first ore production expected in 2019E. A potential catalyst for the stock is the resolution on surface access for the greenfield Cinco de
Mayo project, though timing is unknown. . .we forecast a 12-year
mine life with 20 Mozpa silver equivalent at $6.69/oz coproduct
AISC. . .we are upgrading MAG to Outperform (Speculative), taking advantage of recent share price weakness."
		
		

















MAG Silver's World-Class Property Just Keeps Getting Better
				(3/7/17)

			    		MAG Silver appears to have the Midas touch: Everything it drills turns up silver�with a gold byproduct and lots of zinc, lead and copper thrown in for good measure. MAG's first drill hole discovered the Juanicipio vein and hole #16 discovered the Valdeca�as vein, both world-class deposits. In this interview with The Gold Report, MAG CEO George Paspalas discusses the company's JV in the Fresnillo Trend, the latest off-the-chart deep discoveries and where MAG goes from here.

      Philip Ker, PI Financial
  

(4/11/17)

		
		"After attending MAG Silver Inc. management's technical teach-in, an increased operating scenario at the Deep zone from 2,350 tpd to 4,000 tpd appears likely. . .the increased operating profile provides a 56% increase to the company's annual attributable production and puts the projected 4,000 tpd run rate on the cusp of an even larger operation should any further discoveries be made."
		
		









  Raymond James 

(4/6/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp.'s recent exploration success supports an expanded production scenario larger than originally envisaged, which, with significant additional exploration upside offered by the company's prospective joint venture ground, offers potential to potentially catalyze share price performance in 2017. We feel that current prices represent an attractive entry point for investors looking for high margin, silver-focused, precious metals exposure underpinned by development and exploration upside."
		
		









  
      Bhakti Pavani, Euro Pacific Canada
  

(3/29/17)

		
		"We are initiating coverage on MAG Silver Corp. with a Buy rating. . .based on both the grade and scale, the Juanicipio deposit is by far the best undeveloped silver deposit in Mexico. . .the exploration potential at the Juanicipio property is significant."
		
		












  
      Eric Zaunscherb, Canaccord Genuity
  

(3/16/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. recently revealed plans to develop Juanicipio, subject to a formal production decision expected in Q2/17. . .we focus on the potentially impactful Q2/17, anticipating an expanded project resource, a renewed mine plan capturing mineralization at depth and a positive production decision. Despite increased capital demands, we believe that the company remains fully funded with $141M in working capital at the end of Q3/16."

		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(3/9/17)

		
		"Construction remains on schedule for MAG Silver Corp.'s Juanicipio project, and we anticipate first production by H1/19. Although we had previously expected production by H1/18, we now expect the company and Fresnillo to evaluate a larger throughput scenario of 4,000 tpd up from the current plans of 2,650 tpd; we think the additional capital required to build the larger facility should be modest and the incremental time improves the NAV of the project."
		
		









  Macquarie Capital Markets 

(3/8/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. potentially [is] on the cusp of justifying another expansion. The company indicated that Fresnillo decided to expand Saucito once resources supported a 20-year life; at 4 Ktpd, this implies that once resources exceed 26 Mt, Juanicipio may look to expand (resources at Valdecanas are 24 Mt)."
		
		












  
      Michael Gray, Macquarie Capital Markets
  

(3/8/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp.'s Peter Megaw won the Prospector of the Year 'Thayer Lindsay Award' for the Juanicipio Ag-Zb-Pb-Cu joint venture discovery in Zacatecas state, Mexico. This is one of the great precious metal discoveries since 2000 and has led to the documentation of over 800 Moz high-grade silver (including ounces on partner Fresnillo's 100% ground)."
		
		









  
      Michael Gray, Macquarie Capital Markets
  

(3/2/17)

		
		"We see the geologic center of gravity for the district continuing to point towards MAG Silver Corp.'s Juanicipio both in terms of endowment and high grades. . .the Deep zone Ag eq resource +221% increase (to 254 Moz) is in line with our back-of-the-envelope estimate (289 Moz Ag eq); we are encouraged by the increase and see further potential within Valdecanas and also other veins."
		
		












  
      Philip Ker, PI Financial
  

(2/22/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. recently announced very positive extension and infill assay results from drilling targeting high-grade mineralization from the Deep zones of the Valdecanas vein system. . .the successful discovery and continued delineation of high-grade mineralization at depth is rapidly changing the scope and potential of the project. Assays are demonstrating a significant increase in gold content at depth while intersecting attractive widths to support future bulk mining techniques."
		
		












  
      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners
  

(2/15/17)

		
		"On Feb. 14, 2017, MAG Silver Corp. announced additional drill results from its Juanicipio joint venture. We are encouraged by the continued expansion of the deposit and believe these drill will results will drive a significant resource estimate increase; thus, we are reiterating our Buy rating."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(2/15/17)

		
		"Drilling at [MAG Silver Corp.'s] Juanicipio during the ramp development has continued to return impressive results, primarily at the project's Deep Zone. . .the discovery and development of the Deep Zone have the potential to be transformational for Juanicipio. . .we think Juanicipio could prove itself as not only a large-scale high-grade silver asset with strong base metal credits, but a project that has the potential to host a significant amount of gold. . .the project continues to outperform both construction and exploration-related expectations�making Juanicipio one of the leading development-stage silver projects in the world."
		
		









  
      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(2/14/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. announced another set of deep drill results from the Valdeca�as Vein on its Juanicipio (44%) JV project. . .a slowing of tonnage growth driven by a thinning of mineralization outside of dilation zones is offset by resource growth potential offered by new vein (Anticipada) and the emergence of a gold rich zone. . .MAG continues to offer investors multiple avenues to value accretion. . .drill results continue to support the prospectivity and size potential offered by Juanicipio, and MAG's rank as our Top Pick among silver developers."
		
		












  
      Andrew Kaip, BMO Capital Markets
  

(2/14/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. provided an exploration update on 13 drill holes, including 8 infill holes, focused on expanding and defining the Valdeca�as Deep Zone and new Anticipada vein at the Juanicipio project. Results continue to validate the emerging potential of both the Deep Zone and Anticipada vein, which remain open to further expansion. . .the Deep Zone and Anticipada zones highlight the potential scalability of future production at Juanicipio."
		
		









  Macquarie Research 

(1/17/17)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp.continues to stand out with its 44% controlled Juanicipio JV silver-gold-zinc-lead project as having, in our view, the best undeveloped precious metal asset in the world as located in the world-class Fresnillo Silver District, Zacatecas State, Mexico. . .the 
stock posted a 51% return in 2016 as driven by the increased silver price and the successful drilling at Valdecanas Deep. . .MAG was our #1 pick amongst our Developers in our 2016 -Picking the Winners report. . .
MAG continues to be an attractive takeover target in our view and 
we note FRES owns ~12% of MAG."  
		
		









  Independent Investment Research 

(12/28/16)

		
		"The key standout of MAG Silver Corp.'s 44% owned Juanicipio property is the Bonanza Zone Indicated Resource silver grade of 601g/t and 
626g/t Ag for the Inferred Resource. . .this is reportedly the highest grade developing silver project globally, with contained silver 
of 208Moz in 10.7Mt of resources.In addition the resource has 1.7g/t Au and recoverable lead and zinc. . . Juanicipio, operated through an incorporated JV between MAG Silver (44%) and leading global silver producer Fresnillo plc (56%) is a low sulphidation epithermal vein deposit, located in Zacatecas State, within the Mexican Silver Belt in central Mexico."
		
		












  
      Chen Lin, What Is Chen Buying? What Is Chen Selling?
(12/19/16)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. is one stock. . .that I wish to increase my position. It has the highest-grade silver mine in the world and is fully funded to production. It is a cheap option on the silver price with limited downside." 
		
		












  
      Philip Ker, PI Financial
  

(11/16/16)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp.'s recent pull back in valuation is offering investors what may be their last chance to enter into a position prior to further advancements at MAG's flagship Juanicipio asset. . .MAG Silver and its JV partner Fresnillo are charging ahead into 2017 with solid advancements being made underground with ramp development and exciting exploration efforts which could significantly expand and augment the project production profile of the future operation. . .we continue to maintain our $21.50/sh target price and have increased our rating to BUY from NEUTRAL."
		
		












  
      Joe Reagor, ROTH Capital Partners
  

(11/13/16)

		
		"We believe MAG Silver Corp. has a number of potential catalysts lined up over the next few quarters. . . First, management will provide an updated resource including an initial resource for Valdecanas Deeps early in 2017. . .we expect management to provide an updated mine plan shortly after that. Although the Valdecanas Deeps has not yet been quantified into a resource, we believe MAG will include this zone in its revised mine plan as it represents a potential significant change in engineering and scale for the project. . .all of these pending catalysts should be positive. . .we are maintaining a Buy rating and our target price of $18.00." 
		
		












The  Gold Report Interview with Doug Groh 

(10/18/16)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. seems to have a deposit that keeps on giving. The company's joint venture with Fresnillo has not only gained the market's attention but, also, its partner's full attention. Every time I speak to the company, the news gets better and better. In August the company confirmed an extension of high-grade mineralization from the Deep Zone discovery on the Juanicipio joint venture with Fresnillo. The deep Valdeca�as vein now is offering further upside, great grades, great metal content, interesting geology. Its strike length has now been reported as exceeding 800m to a depth of 200m to 300m beneath the current resource estimate. Mineralized widths range from 5m to 30m of high-grade multimetal zones, including silver, gold, lead, zinc and copper. They report more consistent copper occurrences in the deeper levels. It is an amazing discovery and geologically fascinating as well. The Deep Zone discovery is still open in several directions and there is more to learn about the extent of that mineralization. There appear to be several veins that make up the broader zone, which has yet to be defined. It is the type of discovery that is likely to be one of the best this decade, if not beyond."

		"On September 29, 2016, ROTH Capital Partners attended an analyst site visit to MAG Silver Corp.'s Juanicipio project. We came away impressed with both the exploration potential on the project as well as the potential to have reduced operating costs as compared to the project's PEA. . .we are increasing our price target from $16 to $18 and upgrading from Neutral to Buy as we believe this exploration potential is a near-term opportunity for MAG."

      Michael Gray, Macquarie Capital Markets
  

(10/3/16)

		
		"Our site visit reinforced our view that MAG Silver Corp.'s Juanicipio JV (44% MAG / 56% Fresnillo) is the world's best undeveloped precious metals asset that a developer has exposure to, offering high margin production growth & expl. upside in the Fresnillo Ag District,  Zacatecas State, Mexico. . .we believe MAG is not only benefiting from a low cost structure ($1500-$1800/m dev) but also partnering with a well managed, world class operator in Fresnillo. . .we re-iterate our Outperform Rating, C$25.00 target price & Top Pick status."

(10/2/16)

		
		"We increase our MAG Silver Corp. target price to C$24.00 from C$22.50 and our rating to SPECULATIVE BUY. . .our strengthened view follows a successful second site visit to the Juanicipio JV in Zacatecas, Mexico.

(8/16/16)

		
		"While most people regard MAG Silver Corp.'s Juanicipio as a high-grade project, we highlight the even higher-grade nature of the Deep Zone at the site. Hole VM2, which was drilled at the Deep Zone East, returned 29.85 meters grading 235 g/t silver, 0.50 g/t gold, 4.76% lead, 5.79% zinc, and 0.99% copper. . . we reiterate our view that MAG could eventually be taken out by a larger firm as Juanicipio has proven itself to be a cornerstone asset with exceptional potential for further exploration success."

(8/16/16)

		
		"We have performed a best-efforts resource estimate based on implied geometries and length-weighted average grades for MAG Silver Corp.'s Valdecanas West Vein & East Vein's dilatant and thinner zones to depth. . .this potential ~260mozAgEq resource drives an 18-year mine life in our Valdecanas Deeps DCF & generates estimated FCF of ~$120mpa. . .we believe MAG's Juanicipio JV is the world's best undeveloped precious metals project that a junior has exposure to.

(8/15/16)

		
		MAG Silver continues to offer investors multiple avenues to value accretion,unlocked by the current bullish sentiment surrounding precious metals (silver in particular), a near-term (2018/19E) production opportunity, and significant exploration upside. . .Drill results continue to support resource growth potential offered at Juanicipio, and MAG�s rank as our Top Pick amongst silver developers. . .Our C$22.50 target is derived by applying a 1.4x multiple our on minesite NAV estimate for Juanicipio. Which compares with our silver producer peer group trading at 2.0x NAV. . .we believe this gap will narrow as MAG moves towards producer status."

		"MAG Silver Corp. is the discoverer and owner of a 44% interest in the Juanicipio silver-gold-lead-zinc project in Fresnillo District, Mexico. . .our short-term trading idea was predicated on MAG�s release of potentially very catalytic drill results. . .the company recently completed a 12-hole follow-up drill program on a new discovery made at depth in 2015; [results] are expected by the end of July. This discovery may change the way the entire Fresnillo district is viewed and could, if confirmed, justify a second mining unit, Project 2, at Juanicipio."

		"Raymond James resumed coverage of MAG Silver Corp. as of July 11. "We view the Juanicipio project (MAG: 44%) as, without doubt, the best undeveloped silver asset globally. Our thesis for MAG is reinforced, quite simply, by the exploration upside offered at Juanicipio and elsewhere (Cinco de Mayo) and a lack of broader high-quality silver-focused investible opportunities," analyst Chris Thompson noted in the report. "We see MAG trading at a developer discount to producers, and [primed] to rerate catalyzed by development progress and/or exploration success.� Raymond James also included MAG on its list of preferred silver equities in its July 21 Q2/16 Precious Metals Preview."

		"MAG Silver Corp. announced 1Q16 results; During the quarter, MAG closed a $74.8 million equity financing, which we believe provides the necessary capital to fully fund MAG�s 44% share of Juanicipio�s remaining capital costs. Notably, the capital raise allowed the firm to exit the quarter with $142.0 million in cash�enough to cover remaining capital costs in addition to an approximate $24.0 million safeguard should unexpected increases in capital costs arise during the final stages of construction." 
		
		












The  Gold Report Interview with Joe Reagor 

(5/4/16)

		
		"We like MAG Silver Corp. because it has very high-quality assets with a large number of silver ounces, high grade, in a good jurisdiction and has a solid management team with a proven track record. If a company has those things, then it's in position to turn it into a world-class producing asset. . .[Do you think MAG, being a silver company, will get an extra push in light of silver's appreciation?] I think MAG already has. The company did raise some money earlier this year, and it came out of that very strong. The valuation has moved significantly higher since before the raise was announced. I think that that's a demonstration of 1) the silver price outperformance of gold over the last month or two and 2) that the company is now in position to fund its share of its project, if it isn't acquired before the development decision is announced. Its larger partner, Fresnillo, has the power to make that development decision, which we expect sometime this year. But there is less risk for an investor now, which was part of the reason for its outperformance in the last few months."

		"With closing the recent $74.7M capital raise, MAG Silver Corp. now has a strong balance sheet consisting of $147M and no debt�allowing for continued advancement of the Juanicipio Project. The capital raise serves as a significant derisking event for the firm; there should be no need to raise additional capital once a formal production decision is made.  . .continued exploration success at the property could significantly improve the already impressive resource base at the project. . .the economics of Juanicipio could be greatly enhanced following the receipt of additional drilling results, making the already robust project even more attractive."
		
		












  
      David Sadowski, Raymond James
  

(3/1/16)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. successfully closed an oversubscribed bought deal equity financing for gross proceeds of $65M. We estimate this raises the company's cash position to ~$135M, sufficient to cover remaining pre-production capital requirements at the flagship, 44%-owned Juanicipio project in Mexico, as well as to fund further aggressive exploration."

		"MAG Silver Corp. and its joint venture partner Fresnillo have had their heads down focused on the underground development at Juanicipio, which continues to progress steadily with ramp development. Construction of the decline ramp is now over 2,200m in length and the joint venture partnership is beginning to evaluate its longer lead items for surface construction. . .we are increasing our target price from $10.80/share to $13/share and maintain our Buy rating."
		
		












  
      Greg McCoach, Mining Speculator
  

(2/17/16)

		
		"Since recommending MAG Silver Corp., the company is now up almost 30%. In a bad market, just stick with the highest quality, and when it comes to a great silver company, MAG is about as good at is gets; most of this gain has been during a bad market, and now we'll begin to see how higher silver prices will affect our share price."
		
		












The  Gold Report Interview with Joe Reagor 

(2/8/16)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. has a new discovery that is different from the bonanza zones that make up the existing PEA and resource estimates at its Juanicipio project in Mexico, a joint venture with Fresnillo. The intercepts so far on the new deposit tend to be closer to 20m thick versus perhaps 6m on the bonanza zones. The grade tends to be a touch higher, too. In a sense, it could be a second mine, which demonstrates to Fresnillo that there is upside beyond the Juanicipio and the Valdeca�as veins and leaves some meat on the bone for a potential acquirer. Also, as we mentioned earlier, we like companies that are nearing construction decisions and MAG Silver is roughly six months away from making one. . .under the joint venture agreement Fresnillo can't make a hostile bid to acquire MAG Silver. It would need to make a friendly offer. I don't expect any tension in the relationship created by the upside of that deposit. . .there's going to be an updated PEA that will include an additional resource and a rework of the mine model, which should show improved economics even with flat gold and silver prices. By the middle of 2016, MAG Silver should have all the necessary permits to break ground on construction. MAG Silver was responsible for 44% of the $312M capital budget originally estimated for the project. That should come down in the new PEA, given the money already spent to date. The next step after the PEA is a construction decision."

      Chris Thompson, Raymond James
  

(1/18/16)

		
		"We highlight MAG Silver Corp., Fortuna Silver Mines, and Tahoe Resources as defensive choices, reflective of our view that 2016 will be challenged by continued lackluster metal price performance. . .MAG Silver continues to rank as our top developer pick in the silver sector given its standout economically robust project. . .MAG Silver and Tahoe Resources rank favorably given their low operating cost structure (high margin) and strong balance sheets."
		
		












  
      Philip Ker, PI Financial
  

(1/11/16)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. and its joint venture partner Fresnillo continue to move ahead through construction of its Juanicipio project. Furthermore, anticipation is mounting for commencement of follow drilling on a previously announced discovery at depth at Juanicipio where drills have recently begun to turn once again."
		
		












  
      Gwen  Preston, Resource Maven
(12/23/15)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. is one silver name that interests me; the company is looking ahead to production at its Juanicipio project in Zacatecas state, a developing mine that is a joint venture with 56% owner Fresnillo. Three high-grade silver-lead-zinc veins will provide the initial mill feed but the exploration upside at Juanicipio is substantial; the probability of more�and better�ore below the current deposit is high�Fresnillo's faith that the mine will end up bigger and better than planned shines through in the major's decision to build a much bigger ramp than the current mine plan requires."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(12/16/15)

		
		"On Dec. 15, 2015, MAG Silver Corp. announced the completion of its phase 3 drilling program at the Salamandra property. . .the company has fulfilled the CA$5.5M requirement for the initial 55% earn-in option on the property with a final CA$250K final option payment due by May 23, 2016. In our view, given its expertise in relation to carbonate replacement deposits and presence of mineralization at Salamandra, we expect the final earn-in payment to be made by MAG."
		
		









  
      Kevin MacKenzie, Salman Partners
  

(12/9/15)

		
		"We may see an associated pullback in the price of MAG Silver Corp. as the result of the burst pipeline at the Saucito mine given that the Juanicipio project (44% MAG Silver, 56% Fresnillo) is located immediately adjacent. We view any associated pullback in the price of MAG as an attractive opportunity to buy. . .we maintain our Buy recommendation on the company with a target price of CA$12.05/share."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(11/16/15)

		
		"On Nov. 13, MAG Silver Corp. announced Q3/15 results. . .we believe the current cash balance should be sufficient to support activities for the next year. . .in addition to advancing the decline, exploration efforts at Juanicipio are beginning to uncover what could be a vast longer-term grade improvement. . .we view Juanicipio as one of the highest-grade undeveloped silver deposits in the world and believe recent drill results have the potential to uncover further potential and mine life for the site."
		
		












  
      David Sadowski, Raymond James
  

(11/16/15)

		
		"On Friday, MAG Silver Corp. released Q3/15 results, which provided a number of corporate and operational highlights, including on its flagship, 44%-owned Juanicipio in Mexico. . .we urge investors to bolster positions in the company's stock, our analyst current favorite and top precious metals developer pick. We believe the currently depressed share price does not reflect the true potential of deeps (let alone the main Valdecanas Bonanza Grade silver zone), which could double mine plan throughputs and extend mine life. We model first ounces produced at lowest-decile cash costs in early 2018."
		
		












The Gold Report Interview with Markus Bachmann 

(11/5/15)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. is actually not in production yet, but it is a scarcity story because it's one of the best silver projects around. MAG Silver has a very strong joint venture partner and a lot of exploration upside. You can have an agnostic view on silver, and that company will do well. If you have a more constructive outlook on silver, that company has the potential to do very well. We like companies that have that special touch. MAG Silver is one of them."

The Gold Report Interview with John Hathaway 

(10/26/15)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. has a tremendous suite of silver-rich assets in Mexico, one of which is a joint venture with Fresnillo, the world's largest silver producer. It's hard to imagine that at some point Fresnillo doesn't want to take over MAG for that asset. However, MAG's strong shareholder base, including Tocqueville, won't let that happen at too low a price. The dice are loaded for a deal and for a big move in the silver price, which could come on the heels of a big move in the gold price. I think MAG is one of the best pure silver stories out there." 
		  read more >










  
      John Bridges, J.P. Morgan 
  

(9/24/15)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp. was excited about the progress at the Juanicipio JV (44%), which it called a 'box-ticker,' with its partner Fresnillo Plc (56%) seen as a great executor of projects. Fresnillo also, separately in its presentation, shared its positive view about development of this project. Juanicipio is a 15-year mine-life silver project with an impressive expected all-in sustaining costs of $6.61/oz."  
		
		












The Gold Report Interview with David Morgan 

(9/21/15)

		
		"We have followed MAG Silver Corp. for a very long time. In fact, before anyone even knew the name, I was given a preview to the company by Dr. Peter Megaw, MAG chief exploration officer, whom I consider a friend and mentor. MAG Silver has two projects in the Mexican Silver Belt, the Valdecanas and Juanicipio properties. The company did get into a problem with joint venture partner Fresnillo Plc, which has been straightened out. You don't need to look much further than MAG Silver if you're really a silver bull to put something in your portfolio that I think for the longer term will certainly do well."
		  read more >













  
      Philip Ker, PI Financial
  

(9/2/15)

		
		"Given the state of the sector, we believe the most attractive mergers and acquisitions target would be MAG Silver Corp. It possesses a strong balance sheet (~$85M), is well funded in the near term to
support its capex requirements and its Juanicipio joint venture project is well underway into the construction phase with ~2.5 years remaining. . .therefore, we believe now is the time to increase our NAV multiple from 1.0x to 1.4x (in line with the more recent acquisition premiums)."

		
		









  
      Kevin MacKenzie, Salman Partners
  

(8/17/15)

		
		"We see further potential upside to our target price on MAG Silver Corp. and therefore maintain our current Buy recommendation. . .if follow-up drilling of Valdecanas Deep supports the greater exploration thesis, then we could see a material increase to our applied exploration credit. . .with  reference to the ramp-up of Fresnillo's adjacent Saucito II mine, which is focused on mining the strike extension of the Valdecanas vein, it is clear that there exists the potential to reduce the 2012 Juanicipio PEA opex assumptions."
		
		












  
      Heiko Ihle, Rodman & Renshaw
  

(8/17/15)

		
		"On August 14, MAG Silver Corp. announced Q2/15 results. The company is currently focused on the continued ramp advancement at its flagship high-grade Juanicipio project, which is being undertaken by MAG's joint-venture partner Fresnillo. MAG ended the quarter with $81M cash, which we believe is sufficient to fund the company's planned activities for at least the next year. . .during H2/15, we expect the focus to remain on driving ramp development at Juanicipio in addition to increasing the focus on exploring the newly discovered deeper zone, which we think has the potential to significantly increase resources at the site."
		
		












The  Gold Report Interview with Jeff Mosseri and Doug Loud 

(8/13/15)

		
		"We still like MAG Silver Corp. . .what we like most about the company is its partnership with Fresnillo." 
		  read more >













The  Gold Report Interview with Andrew Kaip 

(7/30/15)

		
		"MAG Silver Corp.'s principal asset is the Juanicipio project, a 44%/56% joint venture with Fresnillo in the Fresnillo District. It's high quality but early stage, with production forecast for 2018. In April, Fresnillo reported assays that included 405 g/t silver, 2.7 g/t gold, 3.2% lead, 4.1% zinc and 0.37% copper over 35.4m. The market was quite excited about these results and for good reason."

	Don's Summary (from last analysis - 05/08/2017)

Mag Silver has an excellent late stage project in Mexico. Their Juanicipio project is a JV with Fresnillo and they have a 44% interest. Production should begin in 2018 and it has a 15 year mine life (likely to be increased). Mag's share will be about 5 million oz of annual silver production (more the first 5 years) at close to zero cash costs. At $50 silver they will have $200 million in cash flow for 15 years. The zero costs are from offsets in gold, zinc, and lead. Juanicipio is very high grade (10 to 15 opt) and a high silver recovery rate (94%). The capex is only $300 million and Fresnillo will pay for 56% and is the operator. Mag's share of the capex is $132 million and they have $139 million in cash.

They will have zero debt and high cash flow. What are they going to do with all of that money? First, they will have a high dividend. Second, they will buy projects and become a growth stock. 

They have an extensive pipeline of projects and are drilling several: Salamandra, Cinco de Mayo, Pozo Seco, Jose Manto, Mojina, and La Esperansa. The odds are very good they will build a few more mines. Mag Silver has the potential to be a very large company. Their only red flag is that they are pricey and we don't know how big they will get. 

This stock has exploded to a FD market cap of $933 million. That's one of the highest valuations for a non-producer. In the near term they will need to grow through an acquisition, because they currently do not have any other advanced projects. I like it as a combination income and growth stock.

Notes

Their first mine (cash flow) is a 44% JV with Fresnillo. Production should begin in 2018. Their share of the capex is $132 million and they have $139 million in cash to fund it. Their share of production is about 5 million oz annually (more the first 5 years). They are projecting zero $2 cash costs for silver production net of offsets. 

They will have zero debt and a tight share structure.

People (wag)

Strong team. 



Mine Locations

Excellent Infrastructure



Ownership

44% of flagship project. 100% of most of their other projects.



Country of Incorporation

Canada



Gold Properties
Silver Properties

10 projects in Mexico. 5 discoveries. 

The Juanicipio project is their flagship project with 44% interest (JV with Fresnillo).

Their share is about 5 million oz of annual production at nearly zero cost after offsets (gold, zinc, lead). 

At $50 silver, that could be $200 million in cash flow for 15 years. Production should begin in 2018. 

They have to spend $132 million for the capex of Juanicipio. Expect some share dilution.

They have $140 million in cash. 



Strong pipeline to continue growth. Drilling about 5 projects: Cinco de Mayo, Pozo Seco, Jose Manto, La Esperansa.

Their second mine (Salamandra) is not yet in pre-development. I wouldn't expect production until 2022. 

Cinco de Mayo has a 4,000 meter strike length. 


With their cash flow they should become a growth stock. 




Hedging
Shareholder Friendly (wag)

Currently, low dilution



Flagship Property

Juanicipio



Ore Grade (wag)

Very high grade (10 to 15 opt) at their flagship Juanicipio project.



Drill Results
Rating History

5/9/2017: Increased their rating from 1.5 to 2 after the stock dropped 40%.

9/20/2016: Decreased rating from 2 to 1.5 after the stock increased in value. 

9/2/2013: Decreased rating from 3 to 2, because future market cap growth is only projected to be 150% in the next 5 years.

6/23/2012: Increased rating from 2 to 3, because their market cap dropped and a new PEA was released showing zero costs and a 15 year mine life at Juanicipio.
