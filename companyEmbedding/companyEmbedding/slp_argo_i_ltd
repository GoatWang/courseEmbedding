When the going gets tough, choose Argo.
That’s the verdict of thousands of hardened outdoor professionals and it’s not difficult to see why. Whether your working environment consists of mud, snow, ice, sand, rocks, water, or swamp, the Argo family of amphibious extreme off-road vehicles can conquer them all.
This is where comparisons end, because really, an Argo XTV has such a wide range of applications that it makes your average recreational quad look like a “one-trick pony” not worthy of occupying the same ground.
Incredible Success
The incredible success of the Argo brand is testament to this hard-won position at the forefront of multi-terrain transport technology. “Argo” has become a byword for reliability, toughness, and extraordinary all-round ability in environments so harsh that having the right equipment can literally make the difference between life and death.
It’s no exaggeration. Emergency services are increasingly coming to recognize the value of having an Argo XTV, as these vehicles can increase their ability to respond in so many more situations. Some places that Argos dare to venture are inaccessible to all other vehicles but helicopters.
Of course, many users don’t have such extreme demands, but the fact that they are good enough for the most difficult terrain is why so many trust Argo XTVs to keep them moving.
For industries from farming to mining, utilities to leisure, there has never been a better time to invest in an Argo.
The outstanding cost to value ratio and class-leading passenger safety makes a convincing business and personal case to choose Argo.
Want to learn more about the different capabilities of the Argo range? Click on any of the models below to find out the unique features and specifications of each.
Certified Argo Dealers
Who is the certified Argo dealer best placed to help you order your XTV? Well, we’re biased of course, but we really think you should call Shank’s. Industry leaders for a generation, the team at Shank’s have built up an enviable record of down-and-dirty experience with the Argo brand.
Wondering which model is best for you? Contact us today – we’ll be happy to advise you on the different applications and help you select the perfect specification for your needs.
Outdoor Power Equipment is All We Do
We live up to our key values of Service, Selection, and Satisfaction. Like you, we know the satisfying feeling of a job well done, and we share your high expectations and standards.
Choose Shank’s Argo for XTV sales, service, and support requirements. You’ll be glad you did.
