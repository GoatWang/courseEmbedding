History[edit]
Mattersight was founded as the Behavioral Analytics service line within eLoyalty, a call center consulting and technology services firm, by president and CEO Kelly Conway in 2006.[9][10][11] In 2011, TeleTech acquired the Integrated Contact Solutions unit of eLoyalty. The behavioral analytics unit launched as Mattersight Corporation.[12][13] In 2014, Mattersight was recognized by Customer Magazine for Product of the Year Award for the second consecutive year.[14][15] In 2013, the company raised $6 million through selling shares.[16]
Service[edit]
Mattersight provides a software-as-a-service using predictive customer analytics, speech analytics, and behavioral analytics technologies to analyze and improve contact center performance and agent interactions.[17] It uses a data analysis system that listens to the way customers respond on the telephone, analyzing communication patterns, grammar, word choice, tone, volume, pauses, and other communication metrics. Mathematical algorithms then interpret vocal features, compare them to their databases, and arrive at a personality profile for each customer, who is then matched with a service agent with whom the customer is most compatible.[18]

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Mattersight Corp (NASDAQ:ELOY) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

It's an IT company, so you're going to have some encroachment on your life, but on the whole it's truly excellent work/life balance. I can't imagine a more supportive employer.You're encouraged to pursue your work interests, even if they lead you to other teams. If you've got great ideas and effort, you can make a real impact no matter what level you're at or what team you work on.Great people to work with across the board.For being a small company, employment and org structure has been quite stable. Seems like my friends at big companies have way more layoffs and general instability than we do.Cool and unique proprietary technology. Lots of things to keep a scientific, technology, or data driven mind interested.Top level management very accessible and supportive. They're involved and in touch with the technical operating details of our business.ConsWaiting anxiously for our business to take off! I'm a bit jealous of IT companies that scale up big time.

The people I work with on a daily basis are friendly, smart, and hardworking which makes the cons almost bearable.ConsThe company leans on smart, recent college grads to make-up for a product that doesn't really work and has constant fire-drills. This company has been in business for 14+ years but still thinks of itself as a start-up. In reality it is a poorly managed organization that attempts to disguise this from the younger employees with free snacks, beer on tap, and a pingpong table. Do not be deceived. Your work will never be good enough despite many and varied attempts to go beyond what is asked of you and you will not receive adequate training or feedback to grow professionally. You're basically a blind rat that needs to run on the wheel faster and faster without any insight as to why this keeps happening.Advice to ManagementInvest in and communicate with your employees. Take an honest assessment of why the entire Marketing Department, many people from Service Delivery and Customer Success teams, and the smartest portion of Finance has left the company in the last 3-6 months. That should give a starting point to improving company culture and financial performance.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (10) Mattersight Response May 14, 2017 – Chief People OfficerHi - I completely agree with you that we have great people and we hate losing them! Unfortunately, we are a growing company in a competitive marketplace so we do lose some talented employees. Onthe upside, we have been able to attract and hire some very smart, talented individuals at the same time. To put in perspective, our 2016 voluntary turnover was 8.7% which is considered low by industry standards. From your other comments, we are clearly not getting it done in terms of communicating with you or supporting you in the ways you need. I would welcome a conversation if you're open to having one on how we can improve on this.

Also, the office is really nice and always stocked with great snacks.ConsMattersight is more or less a consulting company that tries to sell itself as a software company. The average tenure of the exec team is 15 years, so there isn't much tolerance for outside ideas. The problem is that, while the idea behind the company is really cool, there isn't a real product offering to support it. Most of the client deliverables are manually created powerpoint presentations. And they have never once turned a profit in the 68 quarters of their existence.Advice to ManagementThe exec team is staffed by old, white men. They should hire some leaders outside of that profile to grow their worldview.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (6) Mattersight Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Mattersight 2017-04-02 09:41 PDT Apr 2, 2017 Helpful (4)"Professional"StarStarStarStarStarCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chicago, ILFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chicago, ILDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Mattersight full-time (More than a year)ProsI can't think of any pros.ConsToxic & untrustworthy culture.

The office in Chicago is a fantastic work space that affords collaboration and team building.

Many employees belong to IM sports leagues, pursue graduate degrees, or have regular volunteer commitments. Most of management is very supportive of using your vacation time.ConsUnaddressed product limitations can create difficult situations for employees who work with client users on a daily basis. That said, I have seen several key efforts in the past year to overcome these challenges.Despite a renewed focus on increased communication and transparency, messages from leadership can seem superficial and redundant.Advice to ManagementOffer employees honest, balanced communication about the company’s performance and prospects.More frequent opportunities for base pay increases.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Mattersight Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Mattersight 2016-08-18 15:55 PDT Showing 54 of 55 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12345NextReviews > Mattersight RSS Feed</>Embed Mattersight Careers Who is Mattersight?

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
