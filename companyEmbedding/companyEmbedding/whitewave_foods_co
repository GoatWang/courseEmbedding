History[edit]
The company was formerly a subsidiary of Dean Foods, and was spun off in an IPO announced in August 2012.[1]
WhiteWave acquired Earthbound Farms, America's largest grower of organic produce, on Jan. 2, 2014, for approximately $600 million.[2]
In September 2014 WhiteWave announced they were taking over vegan dessert and beverage company, So Delicious.[3][4][5] Whitewave announced in 31 October 2014 the So Delicious take over was complete.[6]
On July 7, 2016, French food and beverage manufacturer Danone announced a $12.5 billion deal to acquire WhiteWave.[7] On 15 August WhiteWave announced a meeting had been scheduled for 4 October for stockholders to vote on the Danone takeover. The Whitewave board unanimously recommend that the takeover bid be accepted.[8] On March 31, 2017, Danone announced it had reached an agreement with the US Department of Justice concerning its WhiteWave transaction for $12.5 billion, wherein Danone sold its "Stonyfield dairy subsidiary in the months after the WhiteWave acquisition closes."[9] The acquisition was completed in April of 2017 and newly formed company is named DanoneWave[10]

                            Our Community
                        



What Philanthropy Means to WhiteWave
Our mission at WhiteWave, changing the way the world eats for the better®, isn’t just about producing great-tasting food; it’s also about doing it in a way that’s good for people, our communities and the planet. We believe in our brands, the passion of our people and the scale of our business to create positive change in the communities where we live and work. In fact, “Share What We Do Well” is one of our six core values and it is interwoven throughout WhiteWave’s long-term growth plan. In 2015, we proudly donated more than 2 percent of pretax profits through cash and products to nonprofit organizations.


Hunger Relief
We strive to alleviate hunger in the U.S. by partnering with local food banks and organizations in the communities where we live and work. Our goal is to ensure access to healthy, nutritious foods and beverages for everyone; so we support local food bank partners that are part of the Feeding America network through food donations, financial contributions and employee volunteerism.
Sustainability
We realize that the health of our bodies depends on the health of our planet, which is why we partner with organizations to promote resource conservation, sustainable agriculture, and build a culture of environmental responsibility.








Our Impact
Since 2006, WhiteWave Foods has donated approximately 12 million pounds of product to Community Food Share, a food bank that distributes to those in need in Boulder and Broomfield counties. WhiteWave was founded in Colorado, and we feel a close connection to our roots.
WhiteWave are also proud to partner with the Carton Council in one of our many sustainable packaging initiatives. With the goal of improving access to carton recycling across the U.S., the Carton Council and several partners have increased access to carton recycling from 18 percent to 58 percent since 2011.
For more than a decade, we have partnered with Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF) to demonstrate corporate citizenship by offsetting 100 percent of the electricity used to produce Silk, So Delicious Dairy Free, Horizon, International Delight and Earthbound Farm at our company-owned manufacturing plants with renewable energy through the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). WhiteWave also has a rich history of being among the first companies to balance 100 percent of our manufacturing water footprint for Silk, So Delicious Dairy Free, Horizon and International Delight through Water Restoration Certificates® (WRCs). In 2015, we made a decision to switch from RECs to carbon offsets for 50 percent of our emission from manufacturing, further evolving our commitments in this space and broadening our focus from purchased electricity to total emissions.
 








Our Partners
By partnering with like-minded nonprofit organizations we’ve made substantial strides to reduce our impact, shrink our footprint relative to production, increase the availability and effectiveness of recycling options, and encourage consumers and employees to create less waste.
We partner with local and national organizations to relieve hunger and improve sustainability throughout the U.S.

Danone, the French company that sells Stonyfield yogurt and Evian water, said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy the WhiteWave Foods Company — maker of Horizon Organic dairy products and Earthbound Farm salad greens, among other brands — for about $10 billion in cash.The deal, aimed at enhancing the American profile of the company that makes Dannon and Activia yogurts, will significantly increase Danone’s presence in the lucrative organic foods market. Also, through WhiteWave’s ownership of the Silk brand of soy and nut milks, the purchase will give Danone a toehold in the flourishing market for plant-based dairy substitutes.The acquisition underscores Danone’s determination to do a better job meeting the changing tastes of consumers, including by shifting aggressively toward the use of organic milk, which is more expensive than conventional.Emmanuel Faber, chief executive of Danone, said in a telephone interview that the company’s plans were comprehensive, from farm to table, and were influenced by shifting cultural attitudes and tastes.

In buying WhiteWave, Danone, which had sales of $24.5 billion last year, will almost instantly double the size of its business in North America, where it is known as Dannon, to 22 percent of its portfolio, from 12 percent, the company said in a news release.Dannon and General Mills, the maker of Yoplait, Liberté, Mountain High and Annie’s yogurts, have struggled over the last few years to preserve market share against the sudden rise of Chobani, in particular, and smaller yogurt brands like Noosa and Fage with more exotic flavors and “cleaner” ingredient lists.About the only way the traditional yogurt giants had left to set themselves apart from their scrappy new competitors was to embrace organic milk, an expensive proposition.That’s because to win organic certification for milk, the cows producing it must eat organic feed, which has been in short supply over the last several years. Stonyfield, the organic yogurt business owned by Danone, has struggled from time to time to get the milk it needs, as have other producers of organic dairy products.General Mills recently announced a partnership with Organic Valley, a large organic dairy cooperative, to help support farmers who agree to go through the three-year transition process required to convert conventional farmland to organic production. Those farmers will supply organic alfalfa, grasses and other grains used to feed dairy cows, whose milk will then be eligible for organic certification under federal regulations.














And Dannon recently announced a program to radically overhaul its milk supply chain in the United States, essentially locking in pricing deals with the farmers who supply roughly 40 percent of its milk needs. In exchange, those farmers have agreed to take certain steps to improve animal welfare and reduce their environmental footprint.They also have agreed to feed their cows non-G.M.O. feed, but at the time the program was announced, Mariano Lozano, chief executive of Dannon, said it would be difficult to go a step further and require organic feed. “Organic goes far beyond and has extremely high standards,” he said. “It’s very expensive.”

Now, however, Danone has apparently decided to simply buy an organic system. Under the terms of the transaction, WhiteWave shareholders will receive $56.25 a share in cash, a 24 percent premium over WhiteWave’s 30-day average closing price. The company’s shares closed at $47.43 on Wednesday. The deal values WhiteWave at $12.5 billion including debt and other liabilities.

“As a branded product manufacturer that sources organic ingredients, you just have to think a little differently about the supply chain,” said Gregg Engles, the WhiteWave chairman and chief executive.WhiteWave, which has a stable of plant-based brands including Silk and Vega, also gives Danone valuable insight into the plant-based drinks business. Mr. Faber said the company had dabbled in so-called alternative protein sources for roughly a decade, building a plant-based brand in Spain and experimenting with fermentation methods in India.Mr. Engles said there were key differences between organic consumers and buyers of plant-based products. “Organic consumers are motivated by a host of things, including first and foremost what they’re putting in their bodies and also what the production of that food has done to the land, its impact on the environment,” he said.“Plant-based buyers are motivated by some of the same things but have greater concern about sustainability,” he continued. “Obviously, plant-based proteins have a much smaller footprint on the environment than an organic dairy business.”So might Danone develop a plant-based yogurt? “I’d love to see us make some hybrid plant-dairy products in the future, moving us to another level of excitement that balances nutrition with innovation to get the best benefit out of both,” Mr. Faber said.The purchase, the largest move by Danone since Mr. Faber took the top job in 2014, has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. It is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of the year.WhiteWave was spun out of Dean Foods in 2013, after an initial public offering the year before. The company reported a profit of $168.4 million on sales of $3.9 billion in 2015.Mr. Engles will join Danone’s board after the transaction.Lazard provided financial advice to Danone, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as its legal adviser. Goldman Sachs was the financial adviser for WhiteWave, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom served as counsel.
