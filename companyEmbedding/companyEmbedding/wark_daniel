Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Wark, Daniel P, DDS801 Yale AveSwarthmore, PA 19081(610) 328-4815DentistsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection2. Wark Daniel P209 Rushley WayMedia, PA 19063(610) 459-2855No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Tibbetts Daniel P DDS1408 Egypt RdOaks, PA 19456(610) 666-5118DentistsImplant DentistryWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Thomas, Daniel P, DDS501 Main StRoyersford, PA 19468(610) 948-5158DentistsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Casullo, Daniel P, Dds - Daniel P Casullo & Assoc - CLOSED101 S Bryn Mawr Ave Ste 230Bryn Mawr, PA 19010DentistsPeriodontistsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Tibbetts, Daniel P601 Williamsburg DrBroomall, PA 19008(610) 353-2700DentistsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Dr Daniel Daley P C3501 W Chester Pike Ste 100Newtown Square, PA 19073(610) 353-1404DentistsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Tibbetts, Daniel P111 S Independence Mall EPhiladelphia, PA 19106(302) 545-9444DentistsBusinesses in related categories to DentistsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collectionPREFERRED9. Kool Smiles General Dentistry for Kids(1009)Find a Location(877) 605-8176DentistsDental ClinicsWebsiteMore InfoMy kids love coming to see the dentist... they are very comfortable wit Dr. Akharume and the entire staff!!!
