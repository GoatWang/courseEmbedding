PLANO, Texas, April 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- BG Staffing, Inc. (NYSE MKT: BGSF), a rapidly growing national provider of professional temporary staffing services, today announced that on April 3, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of privately held Zycron, Inc. ("Zycron") for a combination of $19 million cash, $1 million (70,670 unregistered shares) of our common stock, and certain earn out provisions. Texas Capital Bank, as the lead agent, provided financing for the acquisition through a new revolver and term loan credit facility. 








Since 1991, Zycron has been a leading regional provider of IT temporary staffing talent to companies throughout the southeastern U.S. region and selected markets across the country both with Fortune 500 companies and governmental entities. Zycron had revenues of approximately $38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
L. Allen Baker, Jr., President and CEO, commented, "The completion of the Zycron acquisition in the Professional segment fits perfectly into our growth and expansion plans. This most recent acquisition is accretive to value and allows us to enhance the cash flow we are building for our shareholders. With the addition of Zycron offices in Nashville, Memphis, and Chattanooga, BG now has operations in 56 offices and 25 states."
Baker continued, "We extend a warm welcome to the Zycron staff employees, consultants and customers. As is our custom, the Zycron trade name will remain and operate as a separate brand under the BG Staffing, Inc. umbrella."
Since 2009, BG Staffing has completed and successfully integrated seven acquisitions helping grow revenue from approximately $40 million to approximately $254 million in 2016. The addition of Zycron, its eighth acquisition, adds resources and capabilities to enhance and broaden BG Staffing's service offerings.

BG Multifamily – has become the nations' leading provider of front office and maintenance personnel to the multifamily housing industry. 
Extrinsic, American Partners, and Vision Technology Services - provide highly skilled IT professionals with expertise in SAP, Workday, Olik View, Hyperion, Oracle, project management and other IT skills. 
Donovan & Watkins – expanded our capabilities into finance, accounting and related support personnel. 
InStaff and JNA Staffing - strengthened and expanded operations in our Commercial segment.

RSI Alert: BG Staffing Now Oversold
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. BG Staffing Inc presently has a stellar rank, in the top 10% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.
