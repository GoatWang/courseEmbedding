Financial and Business Strategy Leverages Rise of Consumer Mobile Engagement in $70B Mobile App Market

New York, NY, June  23, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --   
Sparta Commercial Services, Inc. ( SRCO ), a leader in the development, management, and servicing of custom mobile applications, has seen promising results from its subscription-based web and mobile app development services, and continued traction from its vehicle history report products and municipal finance business.


Anthony Havens, CEO of Sparta Commercial Services, Inc. said, "Our latest app development offerings are positioning us to become a leader in the mobile space.  Companies are finding that their customers are demanding quick and easy on the go access to their products and services.  This means engaging customers through native mobile applications.  We've found a way to quickly and efficiently provide quality apps to these businesses."


Over 60% of internet traffic is now coming from handheld devices, and the company's diverse product portfolio is evidence that Sparta has the ability to capitalize on this. The Company has already built hundreds of mobile applications for customers in 49 states and Canada through its iMobileApp business, and is now exploring synergies with its other businesses, including its vehicle history report products (Cyclechex, CarVIN, RVChecks, and Truckchex) which have been sold in all 50 states as well as 61 other countries around the globe. These synergies assist with the building of recurring revenue streams, which is a continued focus for the company, as that will lead to more predictable and sustainable revenue growth moving forward.


The company has also been working to nurture existing and build new municipal relationships through the Sparta Municipal business, which will allow the Company to help municipalities across the country acquire essential equipment while building safe and steady revenue streams. To date, the Company has completed transactions totaling approximately $10 million for a variety of municipalities in the continental United States.

SPARTA COMMERCIAL SERVICES, INC. PROVIDES SHAREHOLDER UPDATE
Financial and Business Strategy Leverages Rise of Consumer Mobile Engagement in $70B Mobile App Market

New York, NY, June  23, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --    Sparta Commercial Services, Inc. (SRCO), a leader in the development, management, and servicing of custom mobile applications, has seen promising results from its subscription-based web and mobile app development services, and continued traction from its vehicle history report products and municipal finance business.   Anthony Havens, CEO of Sparta Commercial Services, Inc. said, “Our latest app development offerings are positioning us to become a leader in the mobile space.  Companies are finding that their customers are demanding quick and easy on the go access to their products and services.  This means engaging customers through native mobile applications.  We’ve found a way to quickly and efficiently provide quality apps to these businesses.”   Over 60% of internet traffic is now coming from handheld devices, and the company’s diverse product portfolio is evidence that Sparta has the ability to capitalize on this. The Company has already built hundreds of mobile applications for customers in 49 states and Canada through its iMobileApp business, and is now exploring synergies with its other businesses, including its vehicle history report products (Cyclechex, CarVIN, RVChecks, and Truckchex) which have been sold in all 50 states as well as 61 other countries around the globe. These synergies assist with the building of recurring revenue streams, which is a continued focus for the company, as that will lead to more predictable and sustainable revenue growth moving forward.   The company has also been working to nurture existing and build new municipal relationships through the Sparta Municipal business, which will allow the Company to help municipalities across the country acquire essential equipment while building safe and steady revenue streams. To date, the Company has completed transactions totaling approximately $10 million for a variety of municipalities in the continental United States.   About Sparta Commercial Services, Inc.
