The rug  we received looked nothing like this.  It was totally red. I took it to Home Depot to return and they talked with the HD warehouse and it was reported that this rug is no longer being manufactured.  Yet the rug we received is not on the website.   Therefore we returned the rug.  Why would HD have a rug like the one above of their website and discontinue it.  This makes for poor merchandising and customer service.

Important Information



  All sales on house plans and customization/modifications are final. No refunds or exchanges can be given once your order has started the fulfillment process.


  All house plans from Houseplans are designed to conform to the local codes when and where the original house was constructed.


  In addition to the house plans you order, you may also need a site plan that shows where the house is going to be located on the property. You might also need beams sized to accommodate roof loads specific to your region. Your home builder can usually help you with this. You may also need a septic design unless your lot is served by a sanitary sewer system. Many areas now have area-specific energy codes that also have to be followed. This normally involves filling out a simple form providing documentation that your house plans are in compliance.


  In some regions, there is a second step you will need to take to insure your house plans are in compliance with local codes. Some areas of North America have very strict engineering requirements. Examples of this would be, but not limited to, earthquake-prone areas of California and the Pacific Coast, hurricane risk areas of the Florida, Gulf & Carolina Coasts. New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and parts of Illinois require review by a local professional as well. If you are building in these areas, it is most likely you will need to hire a state licensed structural engineer to analyze the design and provide additional drawings and calculations required by your building department. If you aren’t sure, building departments typically have a handout they will give you listing all of the items they require to submit for and obtain a building permit.


  Additionally, stock plans do not have a professional stamp attached. If your building department requires one, they will only accept a stamp from a professional licensed in the state where you plan to build. In this case, you will need to take your house plans to a local engineer or architect for review and stamping. In addition, plans which are used to construct homes in Nevada are required to be drawn by a licensed Nevada architect.

Best Price Policy



  Some of our plans are also available on other websites and in printed catalogs. We are committed to selling these plans at or below the lowest price available elsewhere. If you find a regularly priced plan (not “on-sale”) for a lower price, we'll beat the advertised price by 5%. We will match the price for any on-sale plans.


  Once our staff is able to verify that the same plan is offered at a lower published price, Houseplans will offer the plan for sale at the lower published price less 5%. Our discount is available for immediate plan purchase only. Please call us at 1-800-913-2350.


  The advertised item must be the same plan as the product being purchased, including set type (5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD Set), foundation options, and any miscellaneous details. Advertised prices must be in the same currency that the original product was purchased in. Our Price Guarantee does not apply to advertising errors or misprints, special prices, restricted offers, mail order offers, rebates, coupons, premiums, free or bonus offers, OEM products, limited or minimum quantity or limited time offers, close-outs, liquidations, clearances, and special financing offers.

This 1 1/2 story home on a partially finished basement has beautiful hard wood floors, arched doorways, and a sunken living room with a gas fireplace and high ceilings. With 2380 finished square feet, a huge dining room open to the living room, and a rec room and sitting area in the dry basement, this home offers areas for large gatherings as well as areas to enjoy your privacy. If this 1 acre lot which stretches from St. Joe Road to Becker Drive is too large for you, consider dividing it to create a nice building lot on Becker Drive which you could sell to recoup part of your investment right away. The nice sized two-car garage is connected to the house by an enclosed porch which opens in back to a large wooden deck from which you can enjoy the humongous back yard. The yard has mature shade trees, a gardening area, a chain link fence, and an old storage shed. The roof has brand new dimensional shingles installed, so you shouldnt have any expenses there for decades. Dont overlook the advantages of being located on an emergency route: the road is ploughed out right away after a big snow and you have direct access to it " no messy winter subdivisions to get though first. All this could be yours for under $120,000, if you hurry!

                    The History of North Port  from North Port County Government

Incorporated in 1959, the City of North Port, Florida occupies 103 square miles of southeast Sarasota County midway between the cities of Sarasota and Fort Myers, near the Gulf of Mexico. North Port is one of the largest Florida cities in land area but is only 10 percent populated. The City began with a population of 178 and was originally known as North Port Charlotte. The name was later shortened to North Port, which helped to create an individual city identity. Since 1980, North Port's population has grown 120%, making it one of the fastest growing cities in Florida. According to the Bureau of Economic and Business Research, as of 2007 the city's population was 53,732. 

Why is North Port, Florida attracting families and business from all over at such an accelerated pace? Its beauty, convenience, economic development, job opportunities, some of the lowest property taxes in the southwest Florida region and a top notch public education infrastructure including a state of the art high school and middle school as well as a community college less than 5 miles away and 3 four-year institutions within a 60-mile radius. 

North Port has an unspoiled natural environment where wildlife flourishes among 95 miles of freshwater canals. It is also the only city in Florida that contains a state forest (Myakka State Forest) within its corporate boundaries. North Port offers a multitude of recreational opportunities such as golfing, fishing, horseback riding, canoeing and more. North Port encompasses fourteen miles of Interstate I-75 within its boundaries. It has two international airports within 45 minutes making, the City accessible to most major markets. Although, North Port is inland, its weather is influenced by the Gulf of Mexico. The average annual temperature of 76 degrees makes year-round living a pleasure, and the City is host to many seasonal residents as well.
