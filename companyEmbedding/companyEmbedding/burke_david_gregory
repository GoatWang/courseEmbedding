Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Diversified Restaurant Holdings (NASDAQ:SAUC) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $3.50 (37.25% upside)

Our People














 What makes GE people different? Their thirst to learn and their ability to deliver as a team. The idea of teams is simple — but the reality of delivering as a team is not. It requires a culture that values the long view, harnesses change, takes risks, embraces mutual accountability and practices patience. None of this is easy in the competitive world of business. To stay sharp, GE invests $1 billion a year in training. 
 GE is known for its culture of management and learning, innovation and teamwork. New training courses such as the Leadership Innovation and Growth (LIG) program ensure that our most senior leaders never stop learning by engaging them in team-based training. The program’s team-centric approach cultivates a broad view of the business, expedites best-practice implementation and establishes shared accountability to create growth.

 NBC News has a heritage for innovation that spans decades. Given today’s complex environment, with news content available through an increasing number of media sources, NBC News is meeting this challenge by taking its senior talent through team training to strengthen growth strategies moving forward. 
 The results? A strategy that places the “Today” show 17 points ahead of its competitors, an 8% increase in viewership for MSNBC (the only cable news network to post gains in 2006), and the most honored newscast with “Nightly News” winning major awards in 2006 — including a Peabody, Edward R. Murrow, and DuPont, as well as two Emmys.

 2006 was a transformational year for Automation and Embedded Systems (GE Fanuc), a leader in industrial automation and productivity solutions. 
 Following a series of acquisitions, Automation and Embedded Systems is working as a team to align strategies and to inspire employees toward a unified vision. Training has enabled this team to accelerate action plans that leverage domain expertise to expand its global presence and increase new product introductions — growing annualized revenues by 50% in 2006.

 With 1,419-owned and more than 300-managed aircraft leased to 230 airlines in 70 countries, the Aviation Financial Services (AFS) team, also known as GECAS, has the international presence and strong customer relationships to adapt swiftly to shifts in this dynamic market. 
 In 2006 this team demonstrated real results by using its expertise in remarketing and a strong global footprint to move aircraft to fast-growing regions of the world including China, India, Brazil and Russia. AFS has consistently delivered growth — growing assets from $30.5 billion in 2002 to $44 billion today.

 Managing risk in financial investing is an important core competency at GE — and by necessity, a team effort. As GE’s financial services activities have grown to $565 billion in assets spanning 55 countries, our risk management capabilities have also developed to foster and manage this growth. GE has dedicated and experienced risk management teams in every business and in every market that we serve. 
 Building on their 25 years of experience, our most senior professionals engaged in leadership training to challenge assumed expertise and to develop new ways of evaluating risk. In 2006, GE evaluated over $16 billion in acquisitions and over $70 billion of core organic growth. 




See below for photo legend.



Led by Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt, the Corporate Executive Council (CEC) knows what it means to invest and deliver for long-term growth. With an average of 20 years of global and multibusiness experience each, this team is helping GE to build the future.

NBC should fire David Gregory

						  Petition by 
						  Hillary Roth

To be delivered to  

NBC and Steve Burke



Petition Statement
NBC needs to fire David Gregory from his role on Meet The Press. He is a Republican who speaks at GOP fundraisers, does not ask them hard questions, and always accepts the lies without challenge.



	There are currently 114 signatures.
		
NEW goal - 
We need 200 signatures!
		










Petition Background


  
   David Gregory has no business hosting Meet The Press. He was a keynote speaker for a GOP fundraiser and he obviously treats the GOP with favor. NBC has an obligation to be fair and balanced on their network news shows. This has been an issue for way too long. There are many people who cannot afford cable TV and depend on the networks. George Stepanopoulos from ABC is an example of a commentator that asks the hard questions and won't just accept lies for answers. Gregory is a disgrace.
