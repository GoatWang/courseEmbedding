	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT



	This document is in two parts. The first part is this prospectus supplement, which contains specific information about the selling
	stockholders and the terms on which the selling stockholders are offering and selling our common stock. The second part is the accompanying prospectus which contains and incorporates by reference important business and financial information about us
	and other information about this offering. This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are part of a shelf registration statement that we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) under the
	Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act).



	In making your investment decision, you should rely only on the
	information contained in or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and any free writing prospectus filed by us with the SEC. We are responsible for the information contained in this prospectus supplement
	and the accompanying prospectus, including the information incorporated by reference herein as described herein and therein, and any free writing prospectus that we prepare and distribute. Neither we, the selling stockholders, nor the underwriters
	have authorized anyone to provide you with information different from that contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus or any such free writing prospectus. Neither we, the selling
	stockholders, nor the underwriters are making an offer to sell, or soliciting an offer to buy, these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. The information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus
	supplement, the accompanying prospectus or any related free writing prospectus filed by us with the SEC is accurate only as of the date of the applicable document. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have

	As permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, this prospectus supplement and the accompanying
	prospectus do not contain all of the information included in the registration statement. For further information, we refer you to the registration statement on Form S-3, including its exhibits, of which this prospectus supplement and the
	accompanying prospectus form a part. We are subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and therefore file reports and other information with the SEC. Statements
	contained in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus about the provisions or contents of any agreement or other document are only summaries. If SEC rules require that any agreement or document be filed as an exhibit to the
	registration statement, you should refer to that agreement or document for its complete contents.


	Before you invest in our common stock,
	you should read the registration statement of which this document forms a part and this document, including the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus that are described under the caption
	Where You Can Find More Information in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, and any free writing prospects that we prepare and distribute.


	If the description of this offering varies between this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, you should rely on the
	information in this prospectus supplement. Any statement made in this prospectus supplement or in a document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement will be deemed to be modified or superseded for
	purposes of this prospectus supplement to the extent that a statement contained in this prospectus supplement or in any other subsequently filed document that is also incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this prospectus
	supplement modifies or supersedes that statement. Any statement so modified or superseded will not be deemed, except as so modified or superseded, to constitute a part of this prospectus supplement.


	Unless otherwise expressly indicated or the context otherwise requires, we use the terms Sportsmans Warehouse, the
	Company, we, us, our or similar references to refer to Sportsmans Warehouse Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

	SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	This prospectus supplement, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, may contain or incorporate forward-looking statements
	within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this prospectus supplement, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, are
	forward-looking statements. These statements may include words such as aim, anticipate, assume, believe, can have, could, due, estimate,
	expect, goal, intend, likely, may, objective, plan, potential, positioned, predict, should, target,
	will, would and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events or trends. For example, all statements we make
	relating to our plans and objectives for future operations, growth or initiatives and strategies are forward-looking statements.


	These
	forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate and our managements beliefs and assumptions. We derive many of our forward-looking
	statements from our own operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution predicting the impact of known factors is very difficult, and we cannot
	anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results.


	All of our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
	that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to:


	 




	 


	


	 


	our retail-based business model is impacted by general economic conditions and economic and financial uncertainties may cause a decline in consumer spending;




	 




	 


	


	 


	our concentration of stores in the Western United States makes us susceptible to adverse conditions in this region, which could affect our sales and cause our operating results to suffer;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we operate in a highly fragmented and competitive industry and may face increased competition;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we may not be able to anticipate, identify and respond to changes in consumer demands, including regional preferences, in a timely manner;




	 




	 


	


	 


	we may not be successful in operating our stores in any existing or new markets into which we expand; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	current and future government regulations, in particular regulations relating to the sale of firearms and ammunition, may impact the demand for our products and our ability to conduct our business.




	The above is not a complete list of factors or events that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, and we cannot predict
	all of them. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual
	Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC, including subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly
	Reports on Form 10-Q, and in any prospectus supplement.


	Potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors
	carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements we make. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and are not guarantees
	of future performance or developments and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are in many cases beyond our control. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
	statements publicly, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

	PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT SUMMARY




	This summary highlights the information contained elsewhere in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents
	incorporated by reference herein and therein, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed information and financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus supplement. Because this is only a summary, it does not
	contain all of the information that may be important to you. Before investing in our common stock you should read this entire prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and any related free writing prospectus, together with all documents
	incorporated by reference herein and therein, carefully, including the Risk Factors section of this prospectus supplement and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016 and our consolidated financial
	statements and related notes incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement.




	Who We Are



	We are a high-growth outdoor sporting goods retailer focused on meeting the everyday needs of the seasoned outdoor veteran, the first-time
	participant and every enthusiast in between. Our mission is to provide a one-stop shopping experience that equips our customers with the right quality, brand name hunting, shooting, fishing and camping gear to maximize their enjoyment of the
	outdoors. We strive to accomplish this goal by tailoring our broad and deep merchandise assortment to meet local conditions and demand, offering everyday low prices, providing friendly support from our knowledgeable, highly trained staff and
	offering extensive in-store events and educational programming. These core strategies help position Sportsmans Warehouse as the local outdoor experts and the preferred place to both shop and share outdoor-based experiences in the
	communities we serve. As a result, we are expanding our loyal customer base in existing markets and increasing our store footprint in new markets, which we believe will further drive our growth and profitability.


	We were founded in 1986 as a single retail store in Midvale, Utah and have grown to 67 stores across 20 states as of April 1, 2016.
	Today, we have the largest outdoor specialty store base in the Western United States and Alaska. Our stores range from 15,000 to 65,000 gross square feet, with an average size of approximately 44,000 gross square feet. Our store layout is adaptable
	to both standalone locations and strip centers. Based on publicly available information, we believe it is less capital-intensive for us to open new stores compared to our principal competitors because our no frills store layout requires
	less initial cash investment to build out and our stores generally require less square footage than the stores of our competitors. Together, these features enable us to effectively serve markets of multiple sizes, from Metropolitan Statistical Areas
	(MSAs) with populations of less than 75,000 to major metropolitan areas with populations in excess of 1,000,000, while generating consistent four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margins and returns on invested capital across a range of store sales
	volumes. We believe that the foregoing attributes have positioned us to deliver strong financial results, as evidenced by the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Organic store unit growth of 63.6% over the past three fiscal years, representing a compound annual growth rate of 17.8%;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Strong and consistent new store performance, with an average four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.1% and an average pre-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) of 98.3% excluding initial inventory cost (and
	34.2% including initial inventory cost) in the first twelve months of operations for our 20 stores opened since 2010 that have been open for a full twelve months (excluding the 10 stores acquired during this period); and




	 




	 


	


	 


	Net sales of $729.9 million for fiscal year 2015, representing a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from net sales of $526.9 million for fiscal year 2012.




	Four-wall Adjusted EBITDA means, for any period, a particular stores Adjusted EBITDA, excluding any allocations of corporate selling,
	general and administrative expenses allocated to that store. Four-wall Adjusted


	 






	 


	S-1






	Table of Contents





	EBITDA margin means, for any period, a stores four-wall Adjusted EBITDA divided by that stores net sales. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and a
	reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, see Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Operating Data. ROIC means a stores four-wall Adjusted EBITDA for a given period divided by our initial cash investment in the
	store. We calculate ROIC both including and excluding the initial inventory cost.



	Our Industry



	We compete in the large, growing and fragmented outdoor activities and sporting goods market, which we believe is currently underserved by
	full-line multi-activity retailers. We believe, based on reports by the National Sporting Goods Association (NSGA) and other industry sources, that U.S. outdoor activities and sporting goods retail sales totaled over $50 billion in 2013.
	The U.S. outdoor activities and sporting goods sector is comprised of three primary categoriesequipment, clothing and footwearwith each category containing distinct product sets to support a variety of activities, including hunting,
	fishing, camping and shooting, as well as other sporting goods activities.


	We believe growth in the U.S. outdoor activities and sporting
	goods market is driven by several key trends, including: an expanding demographic focused on healthy and active lifestyles; successful new product introductions centered around enhancing performance and enjoyment while participating in sporting and
	outdoor activities; and the resilience of consumer demand for purchases in these categories versus other discretionary categories. We believe these factors will continue to foster growth in the outdoor activities and sporting goods market in the
	future.


	Within the retail sporting goods sector, we operate primarily in the outdoor equipment, clothing and footwear segment, which
	includes hunting and shooting, fishing, camping and boating. This segment is growing at a faster rate than the sporting goods industry at large. The 2011 U.S. Fish and Wildlife national survey, published once every five years, found that hunting and
	shooting and fishing participation increased 9% and 11%, respectively, for Americans aged 16 and older from 2006 to 2011. This survey also found that fishing participation among women increased by 17% over the same time period.


	A 2015 NSGA report indicated that, from 2013 to 2014, there was a 7% increase in hunting with firearms participation, a 7% increase in target
	shooting (live ammunition) participation, a 9% increase in fishing (fresh water) participation, a 9% increase in female participation in target shooting (live ammo), and an 8% increase in female participation in fishing (fresh water) in the United
	States.


	Furthermore, we believe that specialty retailers have generated additional sales volume by expanding their presence, especially
	in smaller communities, which has increased customers access to products that formerly were less available. The nature of the outdoor activities to which we cater requires recurring purchases throughout the year, resulting in high rates of
	conversion among customers. For example, active anglers typically purchase various fishing tackle throughout the year based on seasons and changing conditions. Hunting with firearms typically is accompanied by recurring purchases of ammunition and
	cleaning supplies throughout the year and multiple firearm styles for different hunted game.



	Our Competitive Strengths



	We believe the following competitive strengths allow us to capitalize on the growth opportunity within the outdoor activities and sporting
	goods market:




	Differentiated Shopping Experience for the Seasoned Outdoor Veteran, the First-Time Participant and Every Enthusiast
	in Between


	. We place great emphasis on creating an inviting and engaging store experience for customers of all experience levels. For the seasoned outdoor veteran, we offer a one-stop, convenient store layout


	 






	 


	S-2






	Table of Contents





	that promotes easy-in, easy-out access to replenish supplies, learn about local conditions and test products. We also serve first-time participants and casual users who are interested
	in enjoying the outdoors but enter our store without a clear sense for what equipment they need for their chosen activity. Our highly trained employees, who often are outdoor enthusiasts themselves and users of the products we sell, engage and
	interact with our customers in order to educate them and equip them with the right gear. Our sales associates draw upon both formal vendor sales training as well as first-hand experiences from using our products in local conditions. This selling
	approach allows us to offer a broad range of products and to deliver a shopping experience centered on the customers needs, which we believe results in increased customer loyalty, repeat visits and frequent referrals to other potential
	customers.


	A customers shopping experience in our stores is further enhanced by a variety of helpful in-store offerings and
	features, including the issuance of hunting and fishing licenses, local fishing reports, availability of Sportsmans News (our proprietary in-store newspaper), access to the Braggin Board (where customers can post photos of their outdoor
	adventures), indoor test ranges for archery equipment and displays of customer-owned taxidermy. In addition, we host a variety of in-store programs (such as ladies night), contests (such as Bucks & Bulls, a free-to-enter,
	big-game trophy contest) and a wide range of instructional seminars, from turkey frying to firearm operation and safety. These programs are all designed to help our customers connect with the outdoors and build the skill sets necessary to maximize
	enjoyment of their chosen activities. As a result, we believe our stores often serve as gathering spots where local enthusiasts can share stories, product knowledge and advice on outdoor recreation activities, which both drives traffic and fosters
	customer loyalty.




	Locally Relevant Merchandise Serving the Comprehensive Needs of Outdoor Enthusiasts at a Compelling
	Value


	. We offer our customers an extensive and carefully selected assortment of branded, high-quality outdoor products at competitive prices. We accomplish this in three principal ways:


	 




	 


	


	 


	Locally Relevant Merchandise: We carry over 70,000 SKUs on average in each store, out of a pool of approximately 120,000 total SKUs. SKU is an acronym for stock keeping units, which are unique alphanumeric
	identifiers assigned to a particular product that allow it to be tracked for inventory purposes. Each stores merchandise is tailored to meet local conditions and consumer demand, taking into account seasonal requirements, regional game and
	fishing species, geographic diversity, weather patterns and key demographic factors, so that our customers have the right product, at the right time, for the right location.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Breadth and Mix of Product Assortment: Our merchandise strategy is designed to serve a variety of purchasing occasions, from big-ticket items to replenishment activity, as well as to meet the wide-ranging needs of
	customers from first-time participants to seasoned outdoor veterans. We pride ourselves on carrying an extensive selection of branded, good, better and best hard goods at everyday low prices, including a broad array of in-stock
	consumable items. Approximately 35.0% of our unit sales and 20.0% of our dollar sales during fiscal year 2015 were consumable goods, such as ammunition, bait, cleaning supplies, food, lures, propane and reloading supplies. We believe this pairing of
	product breadth and consumable goods appeals to a broad range of customers and drives both repeat traffic and increased average ticket value.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Strong Vendor Relationships: We believe our vendors find our brand-centric, high-service store concept to be unique among national specialty outdoor retailers. Our attractive store locations, consistent
	presentation of merchandise and thorough product training present a compelling opportunity for our vendors to offer their brands to local markets that historically have been served primarily by mom & pop retailers. As a result,
	we believe we are able to negotiate terms with our vendors that are similar to those offered to our principal competitors that are larger in size. We share the benefits of these strategic vendor relationships with our customers through better
	pricing and enhanced access to certain products that are limited in production.

	Flexible and Adaptable Real Estate Strategy


	. We believe that our store
	model, combined with our rigorous site selection process, is uniquely customizable to address the needs of the different markets we serve. Our stores can vary in size from approximately 15,000 to 65,000 gross square feet. We have had success with
	leasing existing sites as well as constructing new build-to-suit sites. Our flexible store model permits us to serve both large metropolitan areas, like Phoenix, Arizona, and smaller MSAs, like Soldotna, Alaska, while generating consistent four-wall
	Adjusted EBITDA margins and returns on invested capital across a range of store sales volumes. In small- to medium-sized markets, we are often able to establish ourselves as a standalone destination for our customers; in larger markets, we have
	successfully leveraged existing infrastructure to open stores in shopping plazas near complementary retailers, drawing upon existing foot traffic. We believe our low-cost, flexible model allows us to access both large and small markets more
	economically than many of our peers.


	We maintain a disciplined approach to new store development and perform comprehensive market
	research before selecting a new site, including partnering with specialized, third-party local real estate firms. We select sites based on criteria such as local demographics, traffic patterns, density of hunting and fishing license holders in the
	area, abundance of hunting and fishing game and outdoor recreation activities, store visibility and accessibility, purchase data from our existing customer database and availability of attractive lease terms. We have established productive
	relationships with well-regarded commercial real estate firms and believe that we are a sought-after tenant, given the strength of the Sportsmans Warehouse brand, the high volume of customers that visit our stores and our flexible approach to
	site locations. As a result, we continue to have access to desirable retail sites on attractive terms.




	Low Cost Operating Structure
	with Attractive and Replicable Store Economics


	. We strive to maintain a lower operating cost structure than our principal competitors, which allows us to serve small- to medium-sized markets as well as larger MSAs. We achieve this by
	exercising tight control over store-level expenses, real estate costs and corporate overhead. In addition, our growing store base, efficient, localized marketing spend and no frills warehouse store layout help us maintain comparatively
	low operating costs and provide us with the opportunity to achieve four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10% or more for stores in most new markets. Our typical new store requires an average net investment of approximately $2.0 million, which
	includes store build-out (net of contributions from landlords) and pre-opening cash expenditures. In addition, we stock each new store with initial inventory at an average cost of approximately $2.4 million. We target a pre-tax return on invested
	capital within one year after opening of over 50% excluding initial inventory cost (or over 20% including initial inventory cost), although our historical returns have often exceeded these thresholds. As of the end of fiscal year 2015, all of our
	stores that had been open for more than twelve months were profitable and those stores had an average Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.1%. We believe this low-cost, capital-efficient approach also allows us to successfully serve markets that are not
	well-suited for the more capital-intensive store models of our principal competitors. Approximately 59% of our markets currently lack another nationally recognized outdoor specialty retailer, which we believe is a result of these dynamics.




	Significant New Store Growth Opportunity within Existing and New Markets


	. We operate 67 stores across 20 states, primarily
	in the Western United States and Alaska, with a presence in these markets that is nearly three times that of the next largest outdoor retailer. We believe our leadership position in the Western United States, combined with our existing scalable
	infrastructure, provides a strong foundation for continued expansion within our core markets. Over the longer term, we believe our distinct retail concept has the potential to expand to more than 300 locations throughout the United States based
	on research conducted for us by Buxton Company, an independent consumer research and analytics firm.




	Passionate and Experienced
	Management Team with Proven Track Record


	. We are focused on delivering an unsurpassed shopping experience to anyone who enjoys the excitement of the outdoors. This passion and commitment is shared by team members throughout our entire
	organization, from senior management to the employees in our stores. Our senior management team has an average of 20 years of retail experience, with extensive capabilities across a broad range of disciplines, including merchandising, real estate,
	finance,


	 






	 


	S-4






	Table of Contents





	compliance, store operations, supply chain management and information technology. We also pride ourselves on the long tenure of our more than 200 store managers and corporate employees, who have
	been with us for an average of approximately 9 years.



	Our Growth Strategy



	We are pursuing a number of strategies designed to continue our growth and strong financial performance, including:




	Expanding Our Store Base


	. We believe that our compelling new store economics and our track record of opening successful new
	stores provide a strong foundation for continued growth through new store openings in existing, adjacent and new markets. Over the last three fiscal years, we have opened an average of seven stores per year, excluding acquired stores. We have opened
	three new stores to date in fiscal year 2016 and currently plan to open an additional eight new stores in the remainder of fiscal year 2016. For the next several years thereafter, we intend to grow our store base at a rate of greater than 10 percent
	annually and expect that most of our near-term growth will occur within the Western United States. Our longer-term plans include expanding our store base to serve the outdoor needs of enthusiasts in markets across the United States. We believe our
	existing infrastructure, including distribution, information technology, loss prevention and employee training, is capable of sustaining 100 or more stores without significant additional capital investment.




	Increasing Same Store Sales Growth


	. We are committed to increasing same store sales through a number of ongoing and new
	initiatives, including: expansion of our clothing offerings and private label program (such as our recently introduced proprietary Rustic Ridge

	TM

	 and Killik clothing lines), our loyalty
	program, the implementation of kiosks and mobile point-of-sale in our stores and expansion of our store-within-a-store programs with major brands such as Carhartt, Columbia Sportswear and Under Armour. Each of these initiatives is
	designed to foster additional shopping convenience, add deeper merchandise selection and provide more product information to the customer. We believe these initiatives will drive additional traffic, improve conversion and increase average ticket
	value.




	Continuing to Enhance Our Operating Margins


	. We believe that our planned expansion of our store base and growth
	in same store sales will result in improved Adjusted EBITDA margins as we take advantage of economies of scale in product sourcing and leverage our existing infrastructure, supply chain, corporate overhead and other fixed costs. Furthermore, we
	expect to increase our gross profit margin by expanding product offerings in our private label program, including our recently introduced proprietary Rustic Ridge

	TM

	 and Killik clothing lines,
	and continuing marketing initiatives in our higher-margin clothing and footwear departments.




	Growing the Sportsmans Warehouse
	Brand


	. We are committed to supporting our stores, product offerings and brand through a variety of marketing programs, private label offerings and corporate partnerships. Our marketing and promotional strategy includes coordinated
	print, digital and social media platforms. In-store, we offer a wide range of outdoor-themed activities and seminars, from turkey frying to firearm operation and safety. In addition, we sponsor community outreach and charity programs to more broadly
	connect with our local communities with the aim of promoting our brand and educating consumers. Finally, we are committed to local chapters of national, regional and local wildlife federations and other outdoor-focused organizations, such as Ducks
	Unlimited and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. Many of our store managers and employees serve in senior positions in these organizations, which further strengthens our place as leaders in the local outdoor community. We believe all of these
	programs promote our mission of engaging with our customers and serving outdoor enthusiasts.

	On March 21, 2009, Sportsmans Warehouse Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, seeking to reorganize the business under
	the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The plan of reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code was confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on July 30, 2009 and became effective when all material conditions of
	the plan of reorganization were satisfied on August 14, 2009. We incurred certain costs related to our restructuring and emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and included a liability as part of the reorganization value at August 14, 2009,
	the date of emergence from bankruptcy. Bankruptcy-related expenses are those amounts that are greater than the initial estimated restructuring costs, whereas bankruptcy-related benefits are those amounts that are less than the initial estimated
	costs. They are expensed as incurred.

	Adjusted EBITDA has been presented in this prospectus supplement as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles
	(GAAP). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, pre-opening expenses, and other gains, losses, and expenses that we do not
	believe are indicative of our ongoing expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin means, for any period, the Adjusted EBITDA for that period divided by the net sales for that period.




	Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are included in this prospectus supplement because they are key metrics used by management and our
	board of directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. In addition to assessing our
	financial performance, we use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as additional measurement tools for purposes of business decision-making, including evaluating store performance, developing budgets and managing expenditures.


	Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of our financial performance or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as
	a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected
	by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for managements discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service
	requirements, capital expenditures, store openings and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for
	capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that, in the future, we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments reflected in this presentation, such as income
	tax expense (benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization and pre-opening expenses. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management
	compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to
	different methods of calculation.

	On March 9, 2015, a jury awarded $11.9 million against the defendants in the litigation discussed in Note 18 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
	year ended January 30, 2016, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement. We reviewed the decision and accrued $4.0 million in our results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended January 31, 2015 related to this
	matter. We strongly disagreed with the jurys verdict and filed post-trial motions seeking to have the verdict set aside. On July 30, 2015, the court granted our motion for judgment as a matter of law. The plaintiff has appealed the
	July 30, 2015 ruling to the appellate court and the appeal is currently in process. Based on the courts most recent judgment in our favor, we determined that the likelihood of loss in this case is not probable, and, as such, we reversed
	the previous accrual of $4.0 million in our results for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016. The reversal of the $4.0 million accrual is recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in our statements of income, which appear in
	the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement.






	 


	(e)


	We incurred certain costs related to our restructuring and emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and included a liability as part of the reorganization value at August 14, 2009, the date of emergence from
	bankruptcy. Bankruptcy-related expenses are those amounts that are greater than the initial estimated restructuring costs, whereas bankruptcy-related benefits are those amounts that are less than the initial estimated costs. They are expensed as

	RISK FACTORS



	Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other
	information in this prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement, including the factors discussed under the heading Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and each
	subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any risk factors set forth in our other filings with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock.
	See Where You Can Find More Information and Information We Incorporate By Reference. The occurrence of any of the events described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth
	prospects. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock may decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.



	Risks Related to Our
	Common Stock and this Offering




	Seidler will beneficially own approximately 24.5% of our common stock after this offering, and its interests may
	conflict with or differ from your interests as a stockholder.



	After the completion of this offering, Seidler will beneficially own
	approximately 24.5% of our common stock (or approximately 22.7% if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). As a result, Seidler will continue to have significant influence over the election of all of our
	directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions that require the approval of our board of directors or stockholders, such as mergers and the sale of substantially all of our assets. So long as Seidler continues to own a significant
	amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, it will have the ability to exert significant influence over our corporate decisions. Seidler may act in a manner that advances its best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders,
	including investors in this offering, by, among other things:


	 




	 


	


	 


	delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control transaction;




	 




	 


	


	 


	entrenching our management and/or our board of directors;




	 




	 


	


	 


	impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us;




	 




	 


	


	 


	discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	causing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders.




	Additionally, Seidler is in the business of making investments in companies and may in the future acquire interests in businesses that
	directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or our suppliers or customers. Seidler may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be
	available to us.


	Seidler and the members of our board of directors who are affiliated with Seidler, by the terms of our certificate of
	incorporation, are not required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is
	expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors. We, by the terms of our certificate of incorporation, expressly renounce any interest in any such corporate opportunity to the extent permitted under applicable law, even if the
	opportunity is one that we would reasonably be deemed to have pursued if given the opportunity to do so, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to any director or officer in his or her capacity as our director or officer. Our certificate of
	incorporation cannot be amended to eliminate our renunciation of any such corporate opportunity arising prior to the date of any such amendment. Seidler or its affiliates may also acquire competing businesses that may not be attractive to us, and
	have no obligation to refrain from acquiring competing businesses. Any competition could intensify if an affiliate or subsidiary of Seidler were to enter into or acquire a business similar to our specialty retail operations. Seidler or its
	affiliates may enter into or acquire a competing business in the future.

	Table of Contents




	Although we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of The NASDAQ Stock Market
	corporate governance standards, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements during a one-year transition period.



	Affiliates of Seidler no longer control a majority of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are no longer a controlled
	company within the meaning of The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance standards. The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance requirements require that:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors as defined under The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance standards;




	 




	 


	


	 


	our director nominees be selected, or recommended for our board of directors selection, either (1) by a majority of independent directors in a vote by independent directors, pursuant to a nominations process
	adopted by a board resolution, or (2) by a nominating and governance committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the nominations process; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the compensation of our executive officers be determined, or recommended to the board for determination, by a majority of independent directors in a vote by independent directors, or by a compensation committee
	comprised solely of independent directors.




	Currently, a majority of our board of directors consists of independent
	directors and we have an audit committee and a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. However, our nominating and governance committee is not comprised solely of independent directors. The rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market
	require that our nominating and governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors within one year of the closing of our secondary public offering in September 2015 (the date we ceased to be a controlled company), or by
	September 30, 2016. During this transition period, however, we could avail ourselves of any of the exemptions described above even if we are not currently relying upon them. Accordingly, during this transition period, you may not have the same
	protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance standards.



	Our bylaws and
	our certificate of incorporation contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.



	Provisions of Delaware law and our bylaws and amended and restated certificate of incorporation may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or
	acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove
	our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:


	 




	 


	


	 


	establishing a classified board of directors;




	 




	 


	


	 


	providing that directors may be removed only for cause;




	 




	 


	

	In addition, we will be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law once
	Seidler ceases to beneficially own at least 15% of the total voting power of our then-outstanding shares of common stock. In general, subject to some exceptions, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business
	combination with any interested stockholder (which is generally defined as an entity or person who, together with the persons affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, or within three years prior to the time of
	determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation), for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have
	the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.


	Further, our certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will
	be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware
	General Corporation Law; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable
	for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents.


	Together, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that
	otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for
	shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby potentially reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.



	The price of our common stock may be volatile and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the offering price.



	Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for
	your common stock. Since the completion of our IPO in April 2014, the price of our stock has ranged from $5.43 to $14.91 per share. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:


	 




	 


	


	 


	our operating and financial performance and prospects, including seasonal fluctuations in our financial performance;




	 




	 


	


	 


	conditions that impact demand for our products;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the publics reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;




	 




	 


	


	 


	changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;




	 




	 


	


	 


	strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;




	 




	 


	


	 


	changes in federal and state government regulation;

	changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;

	


	 


	changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses
	to such events.

	In addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general,
	experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to
	fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and distract our management.



	Future sales of our common
	stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.



	If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or are perceived by the public market as
	intending to sell, the trading price of our common stock could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.



	We are an EGC within the meaning of the JOBS Act, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to EGCs may make our common stock less attractive to
	investors.



	Because we qualify as an EGC under the JOBS Act, we have elected to comply with some of the reduced disclosure and other
	reporting requirements available to us as an EGC for a period of up to five years following our initial public offering if we remain an EGC. For example, for as long as we remain an EGC, we are not subject to certain governance requirements, such as
	holding a say-on-pay and say-on-golden-parachute advisory votes, we are not required to include a Compensation Discussion and Analysis section in our proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act, and
	we do not need to obtain an annual attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting from a registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We could be an EGC for a period up to the end
	of the fifth fiscal year after our IPO, although we will cease to be an EGC earlier than this five-year period if our total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1 billion in a fiscal year, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt
	over a three-year period or if we become a large accelerated filer (which requires, among other things, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates to be at least $700 million as of the last business day of our second
	fiscal quarter of any fiscal year).


	Accordingly, for up to five fiscal years after our IPO, our stockholders may not receive the same
	level of disclosure that is afforded to stockholders of a non-EGC. It is possible that investors will find our common stock to be less attractive because we have elected to comply with the reduced disclosure and other reporting requirements
	available to us as an EGC, which could adversely affect the trading market for our common stock and the prices at which stockholders may be able to sell their common stock.



	The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert managements attention.



	As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
	Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult,
	time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and proxy or
	information statements in connection with matters upon which our stockholders may vote. As a result of our public disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition have become more visible, which
	could result in threatened or actual litigation, or other adverse actions taken by competitors and other third parties. In addition, our management team has limited experience managing a public company or complying with the increasingly complex laws
	pertaining to public companies, and a number of our directors have limited experience serving on the boards of public companies. The time and resources necessary to comply with the requirements of being a public company and contend with any action
	that might be brought against us as a result of publicly available information could divert our resources and the attention of our management and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	We do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.



	We currently expect to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and growth of our business and do not
	anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions, including under
	the credit agreements governing our term loans and revolving credit facility and agreements governing any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future, that restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend upon, among other
	factors, our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Further, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of
	cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which may further restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization, agreements of our subsidiaries or covenants under our existing or future
	indebtedness. All of our business operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Sportsmans Warehouse, Inc. and Minnesota Merchandising Corporation and their subsidiaries. The ability of Sportsmans Warehouse, Inc. and
	Minnesota Merchandising Corporation to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, is limited by our term loans. Our revolving credit facility also limits our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock. Our ability
	to pay dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, if you purchase shares in this offering, you may not realize any
	returns on your investment unless the price of our common stock appreciates, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.



	If securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our stock price and trading volume could decline.



	The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our
	business and our industry. Assuming we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our industry, our stock
	price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.

	On April 11, 2016, the last reported sale price on The NASDAQ Global Select Market of our common stock was
	$12.21 per share. As of March 24, 2016, we had approximately 90 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders, and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners,
	but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities.








	DIVIDEND POLICY



	We currently expect to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and growth of our business and do not
	anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions, including under
	the credit agreements governing our term loans and revolving credit facility and agreements governing any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future, that restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend upon, among other
	factors, our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash
	dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which may further restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization, agreements of our subsidiaries or covenants under our existing or future indebtedness.
	All of our business operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Sportsmans Warehouse, Inc. and Minnesota Merchandising Corporation and their subsidiaries. The ability of Sportsmans Warehouse, Inc. and Minnesota
	Merchandising Corporation to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, is limited by our term loans. Our revolving credit facility also limits our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock. Our ability to pay
	dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries.

	SELLING STOCKHOLDERS



	The table below sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock by each of the selling stockholders.


	The number of shares disclosed in the table below as beneficially owned are those beneficially owned as determined under the
	rules of the SEC. Such information is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting
	power, which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security.


	The number of shares of our common stock outstanding and the percentage of beneficial ownership before and after this offering set forth below
	is based on 42,004,368 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 24, 2016. Beneficial ownership reflected in the table below includes the total shares held by each selling stockholder and his, her or its affiliates. Beneficial
	ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC.


	For information about certain relationships between us and the selling
	stockholders, see Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions with Selling Stockholders in the prospectus.

	with the SEC on February 2, 2016. According to the Schedule 13G/A, as of December 31, 2015, 7,730,179 shares of the common stock are held of record by New SEP and 7,569,132 shares of the common stock are held of record by SEP. SEP GP is
	the general partner of both New SEP and SEP, and SEP III is the sole member of SEP GP. SKMC as the investment manager of SEP III, has ultimate voting and dispositive power over all of the shares owned by the SEP Funds. SKMCs Investment
	Committee makes all voting, investment and disposition decisions on behalf of SKMC. That committee is comprised of Peter Seidler, Robert Seidler and Eric Kutsenda. None of these individuals individually exercises control over SKMC, and therefore,
	each of them disclaims beneficial ownership over the shares owned by the SEP Funds, except to the extent of their respective indirect pecuniary interests, if any, in those shares. Each of SKMC, SEP III and SEP GP may be deemed, pursuant to Rule
	13d-3 under the Exchange Act, to beneficially own the common stock held by the SEP Funds. Each of SKMC, SEP III and SEP GP disclaim beneficial ownership of the shares of the Company except to the extent of its indirect pecuniary interests, if any,
	in those shares.

	MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS



	The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences generally applicable to non-U.S. holders (as defined
	below) with respect to the purchase, beneficial ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax considerations related thereto. This summary is based on current provisions
	of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code) final, temporary or proposed U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and judicial opinions, all of which are subject to
	change, possibly with retroactive effect. We have not sought any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that
	the IRS or a court will agree with such statements and conclusions.


	This summary is limited to non-U.S. holders who purchase our common
	stock issued pursuant to this offering and who hold shares of our common stock as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment).


	This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to a particular non-U.S. holder in light of
	that non-U.S. holders individual circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, nor does it address any aspects of U.S. federal estate or gift tax laws or tax considerations arising under the
	laws of any non-U.S., state or local jurisdiction. This discussion also does not address tax considerations applicable to a non-U.S. holder subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including without limitation:


	 




	 


	


	 


	banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions;




	 




	 


	


	 


	partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors therein);




	 




	 


	


	 


	tax-exempt organizations;

	persons that own, or have owned, actually or constructively, more than 5% of our common stock; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons that will hold common stock as a position in a hedging, integrated or conversion transaction or straddle, wash sale, constructive sale or other risk reduction strategy.




	Accordingly, we urge prospective investors to consult with their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and
	other tax considerations of acquiring, holding and disposing of shares of our common stock.


	If a partnership (or other entity classified
	as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership (or member in such other entity) will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of
	the partnership. Any partner in a partnership (or such other entity) holding shares of our common stock should consult its own tax advisors.



	PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR
	PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE,

	an individual citizen or resident of the United States;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (or entity treated as such for U.S. federal income tax purposes);




	 




	 


	


	 


	an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a trust if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
	the trust or (b) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.





	Distributions on Our Common Stock



	As
	described in the section titled Dividend Policy, we currently do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If, however, we make cash or other property distributions on our common stock, such
	distributions will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current earnings and profits for that taxable year or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.
	Amounts not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will constitute a return of capital and will first be applied against and reduce a holders adjusted tax basis in our common stock, but not below zero. Any excess will be
	treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of our common stock and will be treated as described below under Gain on Sale or Other Disposition of Our Common Stock.


	Any dividend paid to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the
	gross amount of the dividend, or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty. To receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a non-U.S. holder must furnish to us or our paying agent a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other
	applicable form) certifying, under penalties of perjury, such holders qualification for the reduced rate. This certification must be provided to us or our paying agent prior to the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically. If the
	non-U.S. holder holds the stock through a financial institution or other agent acting on the non-U.S. holders behalf, the non-U.S. holder will be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent, which then will be required to
	provide certification to us or our paying agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide us or our paying agent with the required certification, but qualify for a reduced treaty rate, may obtain a
	refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding possible entitlement to benefits under a tax treaty.


	If a non-U.S. holder provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividend is effectively connected with such holders conduct of a
	trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States), the dividend will not be subject to the
	aforementioned U.S. federal withholding tax. Instead, the dividend generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the manner described below under Effectively Connected Income.


	 


	S-21






	Table of Contents




	Gain on Sale or Other Disposition of Our Common Stock



	Except as otherwise discussed below, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the
	sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock unless:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if an income tax treaty applies, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by
	the non-U.S. holder in the United States);




	 




	 


	


	 


	the non-U.S. holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other requirements are met; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	our common stock constitutes a United States real property interest by reasons of our status as a U.S. real property holding corporation (USRPHC), for U.S. federal income tax purposes.




	Gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the manner described below
	under Effectively Connected Income. A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty)
	on the net gain derived from the sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder, provided the non-U.S. holder has timely and properly filed U.S. federal income tax returns with
	respect to such losses.


	With respect to the third bullet point above, we believe we are not currently and do not anticipate becoming a
	USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property relative to the fair market value of our other business assets and our foreign real
	property interests, there can be no assurance we are not or will not become a USRPHC in the future. If we are or become a USRPHC, so long as our common stock is considered regularly traded on an established securities market, only a non-U.S. holder
	that actually or constructively holds or held more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or other taxable disposition or the non-U.S. holders holding period for our
	stock will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock. If gain on the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock were subject to taxation under the third bullet point above, any such taxable gain
	recognized by the non-U.S. holder would be taxed in the same manner as gain described in Effectively Connected Income below, except that the branch profits tax would not apply.



	Effectively Connected Income



	Any
	dividend with respect to, or gain realized upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of, our common stock that is effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by a non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, if an income
	tax treaty applies, that is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such non-U.S. holder in the United States) will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, based on the non-U.S. holders net income, generally in the same manner
	as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a dividend or gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation, such corporate non-U.S. holder may be subject
	to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty), subject to certain adjustments. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable
	tax treaties that may provide for different rules.



	Information Reporting and Backup Withholding



	Generally, annual reporting to the IRS and to each non-U.S. holder will be required as to the amount of dividends paid to such non-U.S. Holder
	and the tax withheld, if any, with respect to such dividends. This information also may be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides


	 


	S-22






	Table of Contents



	or is established. Backup withholding generally will not apply to distributions to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock if the non-U.S. holder properly certifies as to its non-U.S. status,
	generally on an applicable IRS Form W-8, such as IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person as defined under the Code).


	Information reporting will apply to the proceeds of a sale of a common stock within the United States or conducted through certain
	U.S.-related financial intermediaries. Depending on the circumstances, backup withholding may apply as well, unless the beneficial owner furnishes to us or our paying agent the required certification as to its non-U.S. status, such as by providing a
	valid IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person as defined under the Code), or such owner otherwise establishes an exemption.


	Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit
	against a non-U.S. holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.



	Foreign Account
	Tax Compliance Act



	Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471-1474 of the Code (such Sections and related rules, regulations
	and guidance issued thereunder with any intergovernmental agreements and non-U.S. legislation implementing such agreements are commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or FATCA) on certain types of payments made to
	non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, subject to certain exceptions, Section 1471 of the Code generally imposes a 30% withholding tax on dividends paid with respect to, and the gross proceeds from a
	sale or other disposition of, our common stock, in each case paid to (i) a foreign financial institution (as defined in the Code) (FFI), unless the FFI enters into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury Department to
	perform due diligence and collect and report detailed information regarding its U.S. accounts and their holders (including certain account holders that are foreign entities that have U.S. owners), and satisfies certain other requirements and
	(ii) a non-financial foreign entity (as defined in the Code) (NFFE), unless the NFFE either certifies it does not have any substantial United States owners (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying
	information regarding each substantial United States owner, and complies with certain other requirements. An intergovernmental agreement implementing FATCA between the United States and an applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction may modify these
	requirements.


	Withholding under FATCA applies with respect to payments of dividends on our common stock and is scheduled to apply to
	gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such stock occurring on or after January 1, 2019. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. holder of shares of our common stock might be eligible for refunds or credits of the tax. Prospective
	investors are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in our common stock, including without limitation the interaction of FATCA withholding with the other
	withholding rules discussed above.

	The underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters are obligated to purchase all the shares of common

	We estimate that our out of pocket expenses for this offering will be approximately $350,000. In addition, we
	have agreed to reimburse the underwriters for certain of their expenses in an amount up to $25,000.


	The underwriters have informed us
	that they do not expect sales to accounts over which the underwriters have discretionary authority to exceed 5% of the shares of common stock being offered. The underwriters will not confirm sales to any accounts over which they exercise
	discretionary authority without first receiving a written consent from those accounts.


	We have agreed that, subject to certain
	exceptions, for the period specified below, we will not, directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions with respect to any class of our common equity or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any class of our
	common equity (which we refer to as lock-up securities): (1) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of lock-up securities, (2) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, contract to purchase or grant any
	option, right or warrant to purchase lock-up

	securities, (3) enter into any swap, hedge or any other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic consequences of ownership of lock-up securities, (4) establish or
	increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position in lock-up securities within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or (5) file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act,
	relating to lock-up securities, or publicly disclose the intention to take any such action, without the prior written consent of the representatives.


	In addition our executive officers, directors and the selling stockholders will have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, for the
	period specified below, they will not, without the prior written consent of the representatives, (1) offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any lock-up securities, enter into a transaction which
	would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any lock-up securities, whether any such aforementioned transaction is to be settled
	by delivery of any lock-up securities or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge or disposition, or to enter into any such transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement or
	(2) make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any lock-up securities.


	The initial period during
	which the restrictions described in the preceding two paragraphs will apply, will commence on the date of this prospectus supplement and continue for 75 days after the date of this prospectus supplement or such earlier date that the representatives
	consent to in writing.


	We and the selling stockholders have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters and their control persons
	against liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the underwriters or their control persons may be required to make in that respect.


	Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol SPWH.


	In connection with the offering the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, options to purchase additional shares, syndicate
	covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act.


	 




	 


	


	 


	Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Option to purchase additional shares involves sales by the underwriters of shares in excess of the number of shares the underwriters are obligated to purchase, which creates a syndicate short position. The short
	position may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of shares over-allotted by the underwriters is not greater than the number of shares that they may purchase in the option to purchase
	additional shares. In a naked short position, the number of shares involved is greater than the number of shares in the option to purchase additional shares. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option
	to purchase additional shares and/or purchasing shares in the open market.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to close
	out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the option to purchase additional shares. If
	the underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by the option to purchase additional shares, a naked short position, the position can only be closed out by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created
	if the underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Penalty bids permit the representatives to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the common stock originally sold by the syndicate member is purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering
	transaction to cover syndicate short positions.




	 


	S-25






	Table of Contents



	These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the
	effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in
	the open market. These transactions may be effected on The NASDAQ Global Select Market or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.


	A prospectus supplement in electronic format may be made available on websites maintained by one or more of the underwriters, or selling group
	members, if any, participating in this offering, and one or more of the underwriters participating in this offering may distribute prospectuses electronically. The representatives may agree to allocate a number of shares to underwriters and selling
	group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the underwriters and selling group members that will make internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations.



	Relationships



	The
	underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment
	research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. In the past, the underwriters and their affiliates have not rendered underwriting services to us. The underwriters and their affiliates have, however, provided traditional
	commercial lending services and certain other commercial investment banking services to us in the ordinary course of business for which they received customary fees and commissions. Credit Suisse arranged and serves as administrative agent and
	collateral agent under the credit agreement governing our term loans.


	We expect that the underwriters and their respective affiliates
	will continue to perform various financial advisory, investment banking and lending services for us or our affiliates, from time to time in the future, for which they may receive customary fees and commissions. In the ordinary course of their
	various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including
	bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and instruments
	(directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise). The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
	instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.



	Selling Restrictions



	No
	action has been taken in any jurisdiction (except in the United States) that would permit a public offering of our common stock, or the possession, circulation or distribution of this prospectus supplement or any other material relating to us or our
	common stock, where action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, our common stock may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this prospectus supplement nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with
	our common stock may be distributed or published, in any country or jurisdiction except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any that country or jurisdiction.

	Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations

	,

	Statutory Rights of Action




	Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or damages if the
	offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) such as this document contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities
	legislation of the purchasers province or territory. The purchaser of these securities in Canada should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchasers province or territory for particulars of these
	rights or consult with a legal advisor.

	statements. These statements may include words such as aim, anticipate, assume, believe, can have, could, due, estimate, expect,

	These forward-looking
	statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate and our managements beliefs and assumptions. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our
	own operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution predicting the impact of known factors is very difficult, and we cannot anticipate all factors that
	could affect our actual results.


	All of our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual
	results to differ materially from our expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to:


	 




	 



	



	 



	our retail-based business model is impacted by general economic conditions and economic and financial uncertainties may cause a decline in consumer
	spending;





	 




	 



	



	 



	our concentration of stores in the Western United States makes us susceptible to adverse conditions in this region, which could affect our sales
	and cause our operating results to suffer;





	 




	 



	



	 



	we operate in a highly fragmented and competitive industry and may face increased competition;





	 




	 



	



	 



	we may not be able to anticipate, identify and respond to changes in consumer demands, including regional preferences, in a timely manner;





	 




	 



	



	 



	we may not be successful in operating our stores in any existing or new markets into which we expand; and





	 




	 



	



	 



	current and future government regulations, in particular regulations relating to the sale of firearms and ammunition, may impact the demand for our
	products and our ability to conduct our business.





	The above is not a complete list of factors or events that could
	cause actual results to differ from our expectations, and we cannot predict all of them. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
	statements disclosed under Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2015, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with
	the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and in any prospectus supplement.


	Potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are
	cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements we make. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and are not guarantees of future performance or developments and involve known and
	unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are in many cases beyond our control. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements publicly, whether as a result of new information,
	future developments or otherwise.

	SPORTSMANS WAREHOUSE HOLDINGS, INC.




	Company Overview



	We are
	a high-growth outdoor sporting goods retailer focused on meeting the everyday needs of the seasoned outdoor veteran, the first-time participant and every enthusiast in between. Our mission is to provide a one-stop shopping experience that equips our
	customers with the right hunting, shooting, fishing and camping gear to maximize their enjoyment of the outdoors. We strive to accomplish this goal by tailoring our broad and deep merchandise assortment to meet local conditions and demand, offering
	everyday low prices, providing friendly support from our knowledgeable, highly trained staff and offering extensive in-store events and educational programming. These core strategies help position Sportsmans Warehouse as the local
	outdoor experts and the preferred place to both shop and share outdoor-based experiences in the communities we serve. As a result, we are expanding our loyal customer base in existing markets and increasing our store footprint in new markets,
	which we believe will further drive our growth and profitability.


	We were founded in 1986 as a single retail store in Midvale, Utah and
	have grown to 58 stores across 18 states. Today, we have the largest outdoor specialty store base in the Western United States and Alaska. Our store layout is adaptable to both standalone locations and strip centers. Based on publicly available
	information, we believe it is less capital-intensive for us to open new stores compared to our principal competitors because our no frills store layout requires less initial cash investment to build out and our stores generally require
	less square footage than the stores of our competitors. Together, these features enable us to effectively serve markets of multiple sizes, from Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or MSAs, with populations of less than 75,000 to major metropolitan areas
	with populations in excess of 1,000,000, while generating consistent four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margins and returns on invested capital across a range of store sales volumes.



	Corporate Structure and Information



	On December 4, 2013, our predecessor, previously a Utah corporation, reincorporated in Delaware by merging with its wholly owned
	subsidiary SWH Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with the Delaware corporation being the surviving entity and being renamed Sportsmans Warehouse Holdings, Inc.


	Affiliates of Seidler Equity Partners III, L.P. (collectively, Seidler), initially invested in us in 2007 and, prior to the
	consummation of our IPO, beneficially owned all of our outstanding common stock. Seidler currently beneficially owns approximately 52.5% of our outstanding common stock. We qualify for the controlled company exemption under the
	corporate governance rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market and will continue to until affiliates of Seidler do not control a majority of our outstanding common stock.


	All of our business operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Sportsmans Warehouse, Inc., a Utah corporation, and
	Minnesota Merchandising Corporation, a Minnesota corporation, and their subsidiaries. Our principal executive office is located at 7035 South High Tech Drive, Midvale, Utah 84047, our telephone number is (801) 566-6681 and our fax number is
	(801) 304-4388. Our website is www.sportsmanswarehouse.com. However, the information located on, or accessible from, our website is not, and should not be deemed to be, part of this prospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement or any free
	writing prospectus or incorporated into any other filing that we submit to the SEC.

	RISK FACTORS



	Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider any risk
	factors set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus, including the factors discussed under the heading Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and
	each subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any risk factors set forth in our other filings with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange. See Where You Can Find More Information and
	Information We Incorporate By Reference. Each of the risks described in these documents could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and could result in a partial or
	complete loss of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of
	future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.








	RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES



	The following table sets forth our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each of the periods indicated. The following table is qualified by
	the more detailed information appearing in the computation table set forth in Exhibit 12.1 to the registration statement of which this prospectus is part and the historical financial statements, including the notes to those financial statements,
	incorporated by reference in this prospectus.

	USE OF PROCEEDS



	We will retain broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from the sale of the securities offered hereby. Unless otherwise specified in
	any prospectus supplement, we currently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of our securities offered under this prospectus for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, capital expenditures, working
	capital, and other business opportunities, or for repayment of debt. Pending any specific application, we may initially invest funds in short-term marketable securities or apply them to the reduction of short-term indebtedness.


	We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock that may be sold from time to time pursuant to this prospectus by
	the selling stockholders. We will bear the costs associated with this registration in accordance with the registration rights agreement. However, the selling stockholders will bear any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes, or underwriting
	commissions and discounts attributable to their sale of shares of our common stock.

	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WITH SELLING
	STOCKHOLDERS




	Registration Rights Agreement



	We entered into a registration rights agreement with affiliates of Seidler where we grant to Seidler registration rights for the common stock
	it beneficially owns. Under the registration rights agreement, Seidler may require us to use our reasonable best efforts to register for resale their registrable shares of our common stock under the Securities Act. These registration rights include
	the following provisions:



	Demand Registration Rights



	.


	 We will grant up to three demand registrations to
	affiliates of Seidler so long as the holders of 20% of our common stock held by affiliates of Seidler and their permitted transferees request such registration.



	Form S-3 Registration Rights.

	 At such time as we have qualified for the use of Form S-3, affiliates of Seidler and certain of
	their permitted transferees may require us to use our reasonable best efforts to register the resale of any of their registrable shares on Form S-3.



	Piggyback Registration Rights.

	 If at any time, we propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act for our common
	stock (excluding the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part or any registration on Form S-4 or Form S-8), we will offer to include the registrable shares of Seidler and certain of their permitted transferees in the registration
	statement subject only to a determination by the managing underwriter that the success of the marketing (including pricing) would not be adversely affected by the inclusion of securities of the parties.



	Expenses.

	 We are responsible for paying all registration expenses in connection with any registration pursuant to the registration
	rights agreement, excluding any underwriting fees, commissions, discounts and allowances, and fees of underwriters counsel (other than blue sky).



	Indemnification.

	 We have agreed to indemnify each of the stockholders party to the registration rights agreement against certain
	liabilities under the Securities Act in connection with any registration of their registrable shares.



	Indemnification of Officers and
	Directors



	We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our current executive officers and directors. These agreements
	require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses reasonably incurred as a result of any proceeding against them
	as to which they could be indemnified. Additionally, we may enter into indemnification agreements with any future directors or executive officers. See Description of Capital StockLimitation on Liability of Directors and Officers.






	Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions



	Our board of directors has adopted a formal written policy providing that our audit committee is responsible for reviewing related party
	transactions, which are transactions (i) in which we are or will be a participant, (ii) in which the aggregate amount involved exceeds or may be expected to exceed $120,000, or such lower threshold as our audit committee may
	determine, and (iii) in which a related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. For purposes of this policy, a related person will be defined as a director, nominee for director, executive officer or greater than 5%
	beneficial owner of our common stock and their immediate family members. Under this policy, all related party transactions may be consummated or continued only if approved or ratified by our audit committee. In reviewing and approving any such
	transactions, our audit committee will be tasked to consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in an arms length transaction and
	the extent of the related persons interest in the transaction.

	Table of Contents



	No member of our audit committee may participate in the review, approval or ratification of a
	transaction with respect to which he or she is a related party, except that such member can be counted for purposes of a quorum and shall provide such information with respect to the transaction as may be reasonably requested by other members of the
	committee.

	DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK



	The following description of our capital stock and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws are summaries only. For more
	detailed information, please see our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to reports we file with the SEC.






	Authorized Capitalization



	Our authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred
	stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of July 14, 2015, there were 42,003,599 shares of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding.



	Common Stock




	Voting
	Rights



	Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders,
	including the election or removal of directors. Our directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by stockholders entitled to vote on the election. All other matters to be voted on by stockholders must be approved by a majority of the votes
	entitled to be cast by the holders of common stock present in person or represented by proxy, subject to any voting rights granted to holders of any preferred stock.


	There are no cumulative voting rights for the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the shares of our common
	stock voted are entitled to elect all of our directors.



	Dividends



	Subject to the rights of holders of any then-outstanding shares of our preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive
	ratably any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor.



	Liquidation



	In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, either voluntary or involuntary, holders of our common stock would be entitled to
	share ratably in all assets available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of or provision for all of our debts and other liabilities and the satisfaction of any liquidation preference granted to the holders of any then-outstanding
	shares of preferred stock.



	Other Rights



	Holders of our common stock do not have preemptive rights to purchase shares of our stock. The shares of our common stock are not subject to
	any redemption provisions and are not convertible into any other shares of our capital stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock will be subject to those of the holders of any shares of our preferred stock we may
	issue in the future.



	Blank Check Preferred Stock



	Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to
	issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation
	preferences.


	The purpose of authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences is to
	eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of


	 


	11






	Table of Contents



	preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, future financings and other corporate purposes, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire,
	or could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders by restricting dividends on the common stock, diluting the voting power of the common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of the common stock or delaying or preventing a change in
	control without further action by the stockholders. As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.


	As of July 14, 2015, no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding. All shares of preferred stock offered hereby will, when
	issued, be fully paid and non-assessable and, unless otherwise stated in a prospectus supplement relating to the series of preferred stock being offered, will not have any preemptive or similar rights. We will set forth in a prospectus supplement
	relating to the class or series of preferred stock being offered the specific terms of each series of our preferred stock, including the price at which the preferred stock may be purchased, the number of shares of preferred stock offered, and the
	terms, if any, on which the preferred stock may be convertible into common stock or exchangeable for other securities.



	Anti-Takeover
	Effects of Certain Provisions of Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws





	Set forth below is a summary of
	the relevant provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain applicable sections of the Delaware General Corporation Law. For additional information we refer you to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws
	and such sections of the Delaware General Corporation Law.


	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that are
	intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and that could make it more difficult to acquire control of our company by means of a tender offer, open market purchases, a proxy contest or
	otherwise. We expect that these provisions, which are summarized below, will discourage coercive takeover practices or inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first
	negotiate with our board of directors, which we believe may result in an improvement of the terms of any such acquisition in favor of our stockholders. However, they also give our board of directors the power to discourage acquisitions that some
	stockholders may favor. A description of these provisions is set forth below.



	Classified Board



	Our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors, other than those directors elected by the holders of any series of
	preferred stock, will be divided into three classes, with staggered three-year terms. Only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective
	three-year terms. Because our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights, our stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding will be able to elect all of our directors. A third party may be discouraged from making a
	tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us as it is more difficult and time-consuming for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors on a classified board.



	Removal of Directors Only for Cause



	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, except for any director elected by the holders of any series of preferred stock,
	directors can be removed only for cause once Seidler ceases to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing a majority of the total voting power of our then-outstanding shares of capital stock.



	Special Meetings of Stockholders



	Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the board of directors, or by the chairman of the board of
	directors, the chief executive officer, if any, or the president. Stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting or require our board of directors to call a special meeting.

	Supermajority Vote to Amend Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws



	Our certificate of incorporation provides that the approval of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required to
	amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required to amend our bylaws. Our
	bylaws may also be amended by a majority of our board of directors.



	No Cumulative Voting



	Under Delaware law, the right to vote cumulatively does not exist unless the certificate of incorporation specifically authorizes cumulative
	voting. Our certificate of incorporation does not grant stockholders the right to vote cumulatively. Therefore, stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding are able to elect all of our directors.



	No Written Consent of Stockholders



	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, once Seidler owns less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock,
	all stockholder actions, other than those actions required or permitted to be taken by holders of any then-outstanding series of preferred stock, are required to be taken by a vote of the stockholders at an annual or special meeting, and that
	stockholders may not take any action by written consent in lieu of a meeting.



	Advance Notice Procedure



	Our bylaws provide that our board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, if any, or the president
	may call special meetings of stockholders and only those matters set forth in the notice of the special meeting may be considered or acted upon at a special meeting of stockholders. Our bylaws limit the business that may be conducted at an annual
	meeting of stockholders to those matters properly brought before the meeting.


	Our bylaws also establish an advance notice procedure for
	stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors, or bring other business before an annual or special meeting of the stockholders. This notice procedure provides that only persons who are nominated by, or at the direction of,
	our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of the board of directors, or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given timely written notice to the secretary of our company prior to the meeting at which
	directors are to be elected, will be eligible for election as directors. The procedure also requires that, in order to raise matters at an annual or special meeting, those matters must be raised before the meeting pursuant to the notice of meeting
	the company delivers or by, or at the direction of, our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of the board of directors, or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given timely written notice to our
	secretary of his, her or its intention to raise those matters at the annual or special meeting. If the officer presiding at a meeting determines that a person was not nominated, or other business was not brought before the meeting, in accordance
	with the notice procedure, that person is not be eligible for election as a director, or that business will not be conducted at the meeting, as applicable.



	Blank Check Preferred Stock



	Our certificate of incorporation provides for 20,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock. The existence of authorized but unissued shares
	of preferred stock may enable our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. For example, if in the due exercise of its
	fiduciary obligations, our board of directors were to determine that a takeover proposal is not in the best interest of us and our stockholders, our board of directors could cause shares of preferred stock to be issued without stockholder approval
	in one or more private offerings or other transactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder or stockholder

	group. In this regard, our certification of incorporation grants our board of directors broad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock.
	The issuance of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of shares of common stock. The issuance may also adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of
	these holders and may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of us.



	Authorized but Unissued Shares



	Under Delaware law, our authorized but unissued shares of common stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval.
	We may use these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock
	could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.



	Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law



	Our certificate of incorporation elects not to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law until such time as
	Seidler ceases to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing at least 15% of the total voting power of our then-outstanding shares of capital stock. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects of Section 203. In
	general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a three-year period following the time that this stockholder becomes an
	interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes, among other things, a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the
	interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or did own within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, 15% or more of the
	corporations voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless it satisfies one of the following conditions:


	 




	 



	



	 



	before the stockholder became interested, the board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the
	stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;





	 




	 



	



	 



	upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least
	85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding, shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers, and employee stock plans,
	in some instances; or





	 




	 



	



	 



	at or after the time the stockholder became interested, the business combination was approved by the board of directors of the corporation and
	authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.






	Corporate Opportunities



	Our largest stockholder, Seidler, is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in
	businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Corporate opportunities may therefore arise in the area of potential acquisitions of competitive businesses that may be attractive to us as well as to Seidler. Seidler and members of our board
	of directors affiliated with Seidler and its affiliates, by the terms of our certificate of incorporation, will not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could
	take such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as members of our board of directors.

	Choice of Forum



	Our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of
	the State of Delaware will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us
	arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.


	The overall effect of the foregoing provisions may be to deter a future tender offer. Stockholders might view such an offer to be in their
	best interest should the offer include a substantial premium over the market price of our common stock at that time. In addition, these provisions may have the effect of assisting our management to retain its position and place it in a better
	position to resist changes that the stockholders may want to make if dissatisfied with the conduct of our business



	Limitation on
	Liability of Directors and Officers



	Our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the fullest extent permitted
	by Delaware law. The effect of these provisions is to eliminate the rights of us and our stockholders, through stockholders derivative suits on behalf of us, to recover monetary damages from a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a
	director, including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior. However, exculpation does not apply to any director if the director has acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized illegal dividends or
	redemptions or derived an improper benefit from his or her actions as a director.


	In addition, our certificate of incorporation allows
	and our bylaws require that we indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. We also expect to continue to maintain directors and officers liability insurance. We believe that these
	indemnification provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and executive officers.


	The limitation of
	liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing
	the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.


	In addition to the indemnification in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each
	of our current directors and officers. These agreements provide for the indemnification of our directors and officers for all reasonable expenses and liabilities incurred in connection with any action or proceeding brought against them by reason of
	the fact that they are or were our agents. We believe that these bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements, as well as our maintaining directors and officers liability insurance, help to attract and retain qualified persons as
	directors and officers.

	DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES



	The following description, together with the additional information we include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizes certain
	general terms and provisions of the debt securities that we may offer in one or more series under this prospectus. When we offer to sell a particular series of debt securities, we will describe the specific terms of the series in a supplement to
	this prospectus. We will also indicate in the supplement to what extent the general terms and provisions described in this prospectus apply to a particular series of debt securities.


	We may issue debt securities either separately, or together with, or upon the conversion or exercise of or in exchange for, other securities
	described in this prospectus. Debt securities may be our senior, senior subordinated or subordinated obligations and, unless otherwise specified in a supplement to this prospectus, the debt securities will be our direct, unsecured obligations.


	We will issue the debt securities under the indenture that we will enter into with a national banking association or other eligible party, as
	trustee. The indenture will be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or the Trust Indenture Act. We have filed the form of indenture as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and
	supplemental indentures and forms of debt securities containing the terms of the debt securities being offered will be filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part or will be incorporated by reference from
	reports that we file with the SEC.


	The following summary of material provisions of the debt securities and the indenture is subject to,
	and qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the indenture applicable to a particular series of debt securities. The summary is not complete. The form of the indenture has been filed as an exhibit to the registration
	statement and you should read the indenture for provisions that may be important to you. We urge you to read the applicable prospectus supplements and any related free writing prospectuses related to the debt securities that we may offer under this
	prospectus, as well as the complete indenture that contains the terms of the debt securities.

	these debt securities in the applicable prospectus supplement.

	Table of Contents



	If we denominate the purchase price of any of the debt securities in a foreign currency or
	currencies or a foreign currency unit or units, or if the principal of and any premium and interest on any series of debt securities is payable in a foreign currency or currencies or a foreign currency unit or units, we will provide you with
	information on the restrictions, elections, general tax considerations, specific terms and other information with respect to that issue of debt securities and such foreign currency or currencies or foreign currency unit or units in the applicable
	prospectus supplement.



	Transfer and Exchange



	Each debt security will be represented by either one or more global securities registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company, or the
	depositary, or a nominee of the depositary (we will refer to any such debt security as a global debt security), or a certificate issued in definitive registered form (we will refer to any debt security represented by a certificate as a
	certificated debt security) as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. Except as set forth below, global debt securities will not be issuable in certificated form.




	Certificated Debt Securities




	You may transfer or exchange certificated debt securities at any office we maintain for this purpose in accordance with the terms of the
	indenture. No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of certificated debt securities, but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with a transfer or exchange.


	You may effect the transfer of certificated debt securities and the right to receive the principal of, premium and interest on
	certificated debt securities only by surrendering the certificate representing those certificated debt securities and either reissuance by us or the trustee of the certificate to the new holder or the issuance by us or the trustee of a new
	certificate to the new holder.




	Global Debt Securities and Book-Entry System




	Each global debt security will be deposited with, or on behalf of, the depositary, and registered in the name of the depositary or a nominee of
	the depositary. Beneficial interests in global debt securities will not be issuable in certificated form unless (i) the depositary has notified us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for such global debt security or has
	ceased to be qualified to act as such as required by the indenture and we fail to appoint a successor depositary within 90 days of such event, (ii) we determine, in our sole discretion, not to have such securities represented by one or more
	global securities or (iii) any other circumstances shall exist, in addition to or in lieu of those described above, as may be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. Unless and until a global debt security is exchanged for
	certificated debt securities under the limited circumstances described in the previous sentence, a global debt security may not be transferred except as a whole by the depositary to its nominee or by the nominee to the depositary, or by the
	depositary or its nominee to a successor depositary or to a nominee of the successor depositary.



	Covenants



	We will set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement any restrictive covenants applicable to any issue of debt securities.



	No Protection In the Event of a Change of Control



	Unless we state otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will not contain any provisions which may afford holders
	of the debt securities protection in the event we have a change in control or in the event of a highly leveraged transaction (whether or not such transaction results in a change in control) which could adversely affect holders of debt securities.

	Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets



	Sportsmans Warehouse may not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets
	to any person (a successor person) unless:


	 




	 



	



	 



	Sportsmans Warehouse is the surviving corporation or the successor person (if other than Sportsmans Warehouse) is a corporation
	organized and validly existing under the laws of any U.S. domestic jurisdiction and expressly assumes Sportsmans Warehouses obligations on the debt securities and under the indenture; and





	 




	 



	



	 



	immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no default or event of default, shall have occurred and be continuing.





	Notwithstanding the above, any of Sportsmans Warehouses subsidiaries may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of
	its properties to Sportsmans Warehouse.



	Events of Default



	

	Event of Default

	 means with respect to any series of debt securities, any of the following:


	 




	 



	



	 



	default in the payment of any interest upon any debt security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a
	period of 30 days (unless the entire amount of the payment is deposited by us with the trustee or with a paying agent prior to the expiration of the 30-day period);





	 




	 



	



	 



	default in the payment of principal of any security of that series at its maturity;





	 




	 



	



	 



	default in the performance or breach of any covenant by us in the indenture (other than defaults described above or defaults relating to a covenant
	that has been included in the indenture solely for the benefit of a series of debt securities other than that series), which default continues uncured for a period of 60 days after we receive written notice from the trustee, or we and the trustee
	receive written notice from the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series as provided in the indenture;





	 




	 



	



	 



	certain voluntary or involuntary events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Sportsmans Warehouse; and





	 




	 



	



	 



	any other event of default provided with respect to a series of debt securities, including any events of default relating to guarantors, if any, or
	subsidiaries that is described in the applicable prospectus supplement.





	No event of default with respect to a
	particular series of debt securities (except as to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) necessarily constitutes an event of default with respect to any other series of debt securities. The occurrence of certain events of
	default or an acceleration under the indenture may constitute an event of default under certain indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries outstanding from time to time.


	If an event of default with respect to any series of debt securities at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing (other than an event of
	default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization), then the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may, by a notice in writing to us (and to
	the trustee if given by the holders), declare to be due and payable immediately the principal of (or, if the debt securities of that series are discount securities, that portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that
	series) and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all debt securities of that series. In the case of an event of default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, the principal amount (or such specified amount) of
	and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding debt securities will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of outstanding debt securities. At any time
	after a

	declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders
	of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series, by written notice to us and the trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration of acceleration and its consequences if all events of default, other than the
	non-payment of accelerated principal and interest, if any, with respect to debt securities of that series, have been cured or waived as provided in the indenture. We refer you to the prospectus supplement relating to any series of debt securities
	that are discount securities for the particular provisions relating to acceleration of a portion of the principal amount of such discount securities upon the occurrence of an event of default.


	The indenture provides that the trustee will be under no obligation to perform any duty or exercise any of its rights or powers under the
	indenture unless the trustee receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any cost, liability or expense which might be incurred by it in performing such duty or exercising such right of power. Subject to certain rights of the trustee, the holders
	of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power
	conferred on the trustee with respect to the debt securities of that series.


	No holder of any debt security of any series will have any
	right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy under the indenture, unless:


	 




	 



	



	 



	that holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a continuing event of default with respect to debt securities of that series;





	 




	 



	



	 



	the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have made written request to the trustee to
	institute the proceedings in respect of such event of default in its own name as trustee under the indenture;





	 




	 



	



	 



	such holder or holders have offered to the trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities
	which might be incurred by the trustee in compliance with such request;





	 




	 



	



	 



	the trustee has failed to institute any such proceeding for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity; and





	 




	 



	



	 



	no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the trustee during such 60-day period by holders of a majority in principal
	amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series.





	Notwithstanding any other provision in the indenture, the
	holder of any debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of, and any interest on, that debt security on or after the due dates expressed in that debt security (or, in the case of redemption, on
	the redemption date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such holder.


	The indenture requires us, within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year, to furnish to the trustee a statement as to compliance with the
	indenture from our principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer. If a default or event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to the debt securities of any series and if it is actually known to a
	responsible officer of the trustee, the trustee shall mail to each holder of the debt securities of that series notice of a default or event of default within 60 days after it occurs or, if later, after a responsible officer of the trustee has
	knowledge of such default or event of default. The indenture provides that the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any series of any default or event of default (except in payment on any debt securities of that series)
	with respect to debt securities of that series if the trustee determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the interest of the holders of those debt securities.

	principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may, on behalf of the holders of all the debt securities of such series, waive any past default under the indenture with respect to that series and its consequences, except a default
	in the payment of the principal of, or any interest on, any debt security of that series; provided, however, that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may rescind an acceleration and its
	consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from the acceleration.



	Defeasance of Debt Securities and Certain
	Covenants in Certain Circumstances





	Legal Defeasance




	The indenture provides that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable series of debt securities, we may be discharged from any
	and all obligations in respect of the debt securities of any series (subject to certain exceptions). We will be so discharged upon the deposit with the trustee, in trust, of money and/or U.S. government obligations or, in the case of debt securities
	denominated in a single currency other than U.S. dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with their terms, will provide
	money in an amount sufficient in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank to pay and discharge each installment of principal and interest, if any, on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in
	respect of the debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the indenture and those debt securities.


	This discharge may occur only if, among other things, we have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that we have received
	from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling or, since the date of execution of the indenture, there has been a change in the applicable United States federal income tax law, in either case to the effect
	that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and discharge and
	will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred.




	Defeasance of Certain Covenants




	The indenture provides that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable series of debt securities, upon compliance with certain
	conditions:


	 




	 



	



	 



	we may omit to comply with the covenant described under the heading Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets and certain other
	covenants set forth in the indenture, as well as any additional covenants which may be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement; and





	 




	 



	



	 



	any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the debt securities of that series
	(covenant defeasance).





	The conditions include:


	 




	 



	



	 



	depositing with the trustee money and/or U.S. government obligations or, in the case of debt securities denominated in a single currency other than
	U.S. dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest and principal in





	 


	22






	Table of Contents





	 



	accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank to pay and discharge
	each installment of principal of, and interest, if any, on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of the debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the indenture and those debt
	securities; and





	 




	 



	



	 



	delivering to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income,
	gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and related covenant defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would
	have been the case if the deposit and related covenant defeasance had not occurred.






	Governing Law



	The indenture and the debt securities, including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the indenture or the securities, will
	be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof other than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law).

	DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS




	General



	The following
	description, together with the additional information we include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizes the material terms and provisions of the warrants that we may offer under this prospectus, which consist of warrants to purchase
	shares of common stock, preferred stock and/or debt securities in one or more series. Warrants may be offered independently or together with shares of common stock, preferred stock and/or debt securities offered by any prospectus supplement and may
	be attached to or separate from those securities.


	While the terms we have summarized below will generally apply to any future warrants we
	may offer under this prospectus, we will describe the particular terms of any warrants that we may offer in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement. The specific terms of any warrants may differ from the description provided below as a
	result of negotiations with third parties in connection with the issuance of those warrants, as well as for other reasons. Because the terms of any warrants we offer under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms we describe below, you
	should rely solely on information in the applicable prospectus supplement if that summary is different from the summary in this prospectus.


	We will issue the warrants under a warrant agreement, which we will enter into with a warrant agent to be selected by us. We use the term
	warrant agreement to refer to any of these warrant agreements. We use the term warrant agent to refer to the warrant agent under any of these warrant agreements. The warrant agent will act solely as an agent of ours in
	connection with the warrants and will not act as an agent for the holders or beneficial owners of the warrants.


	We will incorporate by
	reference into the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part the form of warrant agreement, including a form of warrant certificate, that describes the terms of the series of warrants we are offering before the issuance of the
	related series of warrants. The following summaries of material provisions of the warrants and the warrant agreements are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the warrant agreement applicable to a
	particular series of warrants. We urge you to read any applicable prospectus supplement related to the warrants that we sell under this prospectus, as well as the complete warrant agreement that contain the terms of the warrants and defines your
	rights as a warrant holder.

	the date on and after which the holder of the warrants can transfer them separately from the related series of debt securities;





	 




	 



	



	 



	the terms of any rights to redeem or call the warrants;





	 




	 



	



	 



	the date on which the right to exercise the warrants begins and the date on which that right expires;

	24






	Table of Contents



	Warrants for the purchase of debt securities will be in registered form only.


	If warrants for the purchase of shares of common stock or preferred stock are offered, the prospectus supplement will describe the following
	terms, to the extent applicable:


	 




	 



	



	 



	the offering price and the aggregate number of warrants offered;





	 




	 



	

	



	 



	any other specific terms, preferences, rights or limitations of, or restrictions on, the warrants.





	Warrants for the purchase of shares of common stock or preferred stock will be in registered form only.


	A holder of warrant certificates may exchange them for new certificates of different denominations, present them for registration of transfer
	and exercise them at the corporate trust office of the warrant agent or any other office indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. Until any warrants to purchase debt securities are exercised, the holder of the warrants will not have any of
	the rights of holders of the debt securities that can be purchased upon exercise, including any rights to receive payments of principal, premium or interest on the underlying debt securities or to enforce covenants in the applicable indenture. Until
	any warrants to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock are exercised, holders of the warrants will not have any rights of holders of the underlying shares of common stock or preferred stock, including any rights to receive dividends or
	to exercise any voting rights, except to the extent set forth under Warrant Adjustments below.



	Exercise of Warrants



	Each holder of a warrant is entitled to purchase the principal amount of debt securities or number of shares of common stock or
	preferred stock, as the case may be, at the exercise price described in the applicable prospectus supplement. After the close of business on the day when the right to exercise terminates (or a later date if we extend the time for exercise),
	unexercised warrants will become void.


	A holder of warrants may exercise them by following the general procedure outlined below:


	 




	 



	



	 



	deliver to the warrant agent the payment required by the applicable prospectus supplement to purchase the underlying security;





	 




	 



	



	 



	properly complete and sign the reverse side of the warrant certificate representing the warrants; and





	 




	 



	



	 



	deliver the warrant certificate representing the warrants to the warrant agent within five business days of the warrant agent receiving payment of
	the exercise price.





	If you comply with the procedures described above, your warrants will be considered to have been
	exercised when the warrant agent receives payment of the exercise price, subject to the transfer books for the securities issuable upon exercise of the warrant not being closed on such date. After you have completed those procedures


	 


	25






	Table of Contents



	and subject to the foregoing, we will, as soon as practicable, issue and deliver to you the debt securities or shares of common stock or preferred stock that you purchased upon exercise. If you
	exercise fewer than all of the warrants represented by a warrant certificate, a new warrant certificate will be issued to you for the unexercised amount of warrants. Holders of warrants will be required to pay any tax or governmental charge that may
	be imposed in connection with transferring the underlying securities in connection with the exercise of the warrants.



	Amendments and
	Supplements to the Warrant Agreements



	We may amend or supplement a warrant agreement without the consent of the holders of the
	applicable warrants to cure ambiguities in the warrant agreement, to cure or correct a defective provision in the warrant agreement, or to provide for other matters under the warrant agreement that we and the warrant agent deem necessary or
	desirable, so long as, in each case, such amendments or supplements do not materially adversely affect the interests of the holders of the warrants.



	Warrant Adjustments



	Unless the applicable prospectus supplement states otherwise, the exercise price of, and the number of securities covered by, a warrant for
	shares of common stock or preferred stock will be adjusted proportionately if we subdivide or combine our common stock or preferred stock, as applicable. In addition, unless the prospectus supplement states otherwise, if we, without payment:


	 




	 



	



	 



	issue shares of common stock or preferred stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or preferred stock, or any
	rights to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any of the foregoing, as a dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of our common stock or preferred stock;





	 




	 



	



	 



	pay any cash to all or substantially all holders of our common stock or preferred stock, other than a cash dividend paid out of our current or
	retained earnings;





	 




	 



	



	 



	issue any evidence of our indebtedness or rights to subscribe for or purchase our indebtedness to all or substantially all holders of our common
	stock or preferred stock; or





	 




	 



	



	 



	issue common stock, preferred stock or additional shares or other securities or property to all or substantially all holders of our common stock or
	preferred stock by way of spinoff, split-up, reclassification, combination of shares or similar corporate rearrangement;





	then the holders of common stock warrants or preferred stock warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the warrants, in addition
	to the securities otherwise receivable upon exercise of the warrants and without paying any additional consideration, the amount of shares and other securities and property such holders would have been entitled to receive had they held the common
	stock or preferred stock issuable under the warrants on the dates on which holders of those securities received or became entitled to receive such additional shares and other securities and property.


	Except as stated above, the exercise price and number of securities covered by a warrant for shares of common stock or preferred stock, and
	the amounts of other securities or property to be received, if any, upon exercise of those warrants, will not be adjusted or provided for if we issue those securities or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for those securities, or
	securities carrying the right to purchase those securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for those securities.


	Holders
	of common stock warrants or preferred stock warrants may have additional rights under the following circumstances:


	 




	 



	



	 



	certain reclassifications, capital reorganizations or changes of the common stock or preferred stock;





	 




	 



	



	 



	certain share exchanges, mergers, or similar transactions involving us that result in changes of the common stock or preferred stock; or





	 




	 



	



	 



	certain sales or dispositions to another entity of all or substantially all of our property and assets.





	 


	26






	Table of Contents



	If one of the above transactions occurs and holders of our common stock or preferred stock are
	entitled to receive shares, securities or other property with respect to or in exchange for their securities, the holders of the common stock warrants or preferred stock warrants then-outstanding, as applicable, will be entitled to receive upon
	exercise of their warrants the kind and amount of shares and other securities or property that they would have received upon the applicable transaction if they had exercised their warrants immediately before the transaction.

	DESCRIPTION OF RIGHTS



	The following description, together with the additional information we include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizes the general
	features of the rights that we may offer under this prospectus. We may issue rights to our stockholders to purchase shares of our common stock and/or any of the other securities offered hereby. Each series of rights will be issued under a separate
	rights agreement to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company, as rights agent. When we issue rights, we will provide the specific terms of the rights and the applicable rights agreement in a prospectus supplement. Because the terms of
	any rights we offer under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms we describe below, you should rely solely on information in the applicable prospectus supplement if that summary is different from the summary in this prospectus. We will
	incorporate by reference into the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part the form of rights agreement that describes the terms of the series of rights we are offering before the issuance of the related series of rights. The
	applicable prospectus supplement relating to any rights will describe the terms of the offered rights, including, where applicable, the following:


	 




	 



	



	 



	the date for determining the persons entitled to participate in the rights distribution;





	 




	 



	



	 



	the exercise price for the rights;





	 




	 



	



	 



	the aggregate number or amount of underlying securities purchasable upon exercise of the rights;





	 




	 



	



	 



	the number of rights issued to each stockholder and the number of rights outstanding, if any;





	 




	 



	



	 



	the extent to which the rights are transferable;





	 




	 



	



	 



	the date on which the right to exercise the rights will commence and the date on which the right will expire;





	 




	 



	



	 



	the extent to which the rights include an over-subscription privilege with respect to unsubscribed securities;





	 




	 



	



	 



	anti-dilution provisions of the rights, if any; and





	 




	 



	



	 



	any other terms of the rights, including terms, procedures and limitations relating to the distribution, exchange and exercise of the rights.





	Holders may exercise rights as described in the applicable prospectus supplement. Upon receipt of payment and the
	rights certificate properly completed and duly executed at the corporate trust office of the rights agent or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement, we will, as soon as practicable, forward the securities purchasable upon exercise
	of the rights. If less than all of the rights issued in any rights offering are exercised, we may offer any unsubscribed securities directly to persons other than stockholders, to or through agents, underwriters or dealers or through a combination
	of such methods, including pursuant to standby underwriting arrangements, as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.

	DESCRIPTION OF UNITS



	We may issue units comprising two or more securities described in this prospectus in any combination. For example, we might issue units
	consisting of a combination of debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock. The following description sets forth certain general terms and provisions of the units that we may offer pursuant to this prospectus. The particular terms of the
	units and the extent, if any, to which the general terms and provisions may apply to the units so offered will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement.


	Each unit will be issued so that the holder of the unit also is the holder of each security included in the unit. Thus, the unit will have the
	rights and obligations of a holder of each included security. Units will be issued pursuant to the terms of a unit agreement, which may provide that the securities included in the unit may not be held or transferred separately at any time or at any
	time before a specified date. A copy of the forms of the unit agreement and the unit certificate relating to any particular issue of units will be filed with the SEC each time we issue units, and you should read those documents for provisions that
	may be important to you. For more information on how you can obtain copies of the forms of the unit agreement and the related unit certificate, see Where You Can Find More Information.


	The prospectus supplement relating to any particular issuance of units will describe the terms of those units, including, to the extent
	applicable, the following:


	 




	 



	



	 



	the designation and terms of the units and the securities comprising the units, including whether and under what circumstances those securities may
	be held or transferred separately;





	 




	 



	

	shares received after the date of this prospectus from a selling stockholder as a gift, pledge, partnership distribution or other non-sale related transfer.


	We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock that may be sold from time to time pursuant to this prospectus by
	the selling stockholders. We will bear the costs associated with this registration in accordance with the registration rights agreement. However, the selling stockholders will bear any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes, or underwriting
	commissions and discounts attributable to their sale of shares of our common stock.


	The securities may be distributed
	from time to time in one or more transactions:


	 




	 



	



	 



	at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed;

	

	Offers to purchase the securities being offered by this prospectus may be solicited directly. Agents may also be designated to solicit offers
	to purchase the securities from time to time. Any agent involved in the offer or sale of our securities will be identified in a prospectus supplement.


	If a dealer is utilized in the sale of the securities being offered by this prospectus, the securities will be sold to the dealer, as
	principal. The dealer may then resell the securities to the public at varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the time of resale.


	If an underwriter is utilized in the sale of the securities being offered by this prospectus, an underwriting agreement will be executed with
	the underwriter at the time of sale and the name of any underwriter will be provided in the prospectus supplement that the underwriter will use to make resales of the securities to the public. In connection with the sale of the securities, we, or
	selling stockholders, or the purchasers of securities for whom

	Table of Contents



	the underwriter may act as agent, may compensate the underwriter in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions. The underwriter may sell the securities to or through dealers, and those
	dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for which they may act as agent. Unless otherwise indicated in a prospectus supplement, an agent will
	be acting on a best efforts basis and a dealer will purchase securities as a principal, and may then resell the securities at varying prices to be determined by the dealer.


	Any compensation paid to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of the securities, and any discounts, concessions or
	commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplement. Underwriters, dealers and agents participating in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters within the
	meaning of the Securities Act, and any discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on resale of the securities may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions. In compliance with the guidelines of the
	Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, the maximum amount of underwriting compensation, including underwriting discounts and commissions, to be paid in connection with any offering of securities pursuant to this prospectus may not
	exceed 8% of the aggregate principal amount of securities offered. We may enter into agreements to indemnify underwriters, dealers and agents against civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments
	they may be required to make in respect thereof and to reimburse those persons for certain expenses.


	The securities may or may not be
	listed on a national securities exchange. To facilitate the offering of securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the securities. This may include
	over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involve the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than were sold to them. In these circumstances, these persons would cover such over-allotments or short positions by
	making purchases in the open market or by exercising their over-allotment option, if any. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding for or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing
	penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to
	stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be discontinued at any time.


	If indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, underwriters or other persons acting as agents may be authorized to solicit offers by
	institutions or other suitable purchasers to purchase the securities at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement, pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on the date or dates stated in the
	prospectus supplement. These purchasers may include, among others, commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions. Delayed delivery contracts will be subject to the
	condition that the purchase of the securities covered by the delayed delivery contracts will not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of any jurisdiction in the United States to which the purchaser is subject. The underwriters and
	agents will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of these contracts.


	We may engage in at-the-market
	offerings into an existing trading market in accordance with rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act. In addition, we or the selling stockholders may enter into derivative transactions with third parties, or sell securities not covered by this
	prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. If the applicable prospectus supplement so indicates, in connection with those derivatives, the third parties may sell securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable
	prospectus supplement, including in short sale transactions. If so, the third party may use securities pledged by us, the selling stockholders or borrowed from us, the selling stockholders or others to settle those sales or to close out any related
	open borrowings of common stock, and may use securities received from us or the selling stockholders in settlement of those derivatives to close out any related open borrowings of our common stock. In addition, we or the selling stockholders may
	loan or pledge securities to a financial institution or other third party that in turn may sell the securities using this

	prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement. Such financial institution or other third party may transfer its economic short position to investors in our securities or in connection with a
	concurrent offering of other securities.


	The underwriters, dealers and agents may engage in transactions with us, or perform services for
	us, in the ordinary course of business for which they receive compensation.

	LEGAL MATTERS



	Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, certain legal matters in connection with the offering and the validity of
	the securities offered by this prospectus, and any supplement thereto, will be passed upon by OMelveny 
	& Myers LLP.
