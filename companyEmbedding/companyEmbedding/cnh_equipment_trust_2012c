Fitch Expects to Rate CNH Equipment Trust 2012-B; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate CNH Equipment Trust 2012-B; Presale Issued
    





June 11, 2012 09:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to rate CNH Equipment Trust 2012-B as follows:
    

      CNH Equipment Trust 2012-B
    

      --$155,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$235,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$235,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$107,372,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17,628,000 class B notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report titled 'CNH Equipment Trust 2012-B, dated June 11, 2012, 
      which is available on Fitch's web site. The presale report details how 
      Fitch addresses the key rating drivers which are summarized below.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High AG Concentration: The 2012-B collateral pool consists of 93.67% 
      agricultural equipment (AG) and 6.33% construction equipment (CO). While 
      the 2012-B AG concentration is consistent, albeit slightly lower, with 
      CNH Capital securitizations going back to 2009, the AG concentrations in 
      all these transactions are up significantly versus CNH Capital 
      transactions issued prior to 2009, which consisted of approximately 18% 
      to 32% CO.
    

      Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 49.70% used 
      equipment, slightly higher than 2012-A (not rated by Fitch) (48.99%) but 
      lower than 2011-C (53.01%). Furthermore, the pool consists of 75.55% 
      annual pay contracts, which historically have experienced a lower level 
      of losses compared to other payment types.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement for the 2012-B 
      transaction has declined from prior transactions. Class A credit 
      enhancement has declined to 4.60% from 5.20% in 2012-A and 2011-C.
    

      Quality Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing Platform: CNH Capital 
      has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of 
      securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

Fitch Affirms CNH Equipment Trust 2012-B | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms CNH Equipment Trust 2012-B
    





July 27, 2015 10:59 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings affirms all classes of CNH Equipment Trust 2012-B at their 
      current ratings. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this ratings action commentary.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of the class A notes reflect loss coverage levels 
      consistent with the current ratings. As of the June 2015 reporting 
      period, cumulative net losses totaled 36 basis points, and as such, the 
      transaction is extrapolating below Fitch's initial base case loss proxy. 
      The Stable Outlook for all classes reflects Fitch's expectation for loss 
      coverage and credit enhancement to continue to improve as the 
      transaction amortizes.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy, which would impact available loss coverage. Lower loss 
      coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks, depending on the 
      extent of the decline in coverage. In Fitch's initial review of the 
      transaction, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to 1.5x 
      and 2.5x higher of Fitch's base case loss expectation. Initial key 
      rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the new 
      issue report published June 11, 2012.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses 
      within Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and 
      multiple levels. As such, continued strong performance for the 
      transaction would most likely result in continued stable ratings. 
      Conversely, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur 
      within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the 
      outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of CNH 
      2012-B can be found in 'CNH Equipment Trust 2012-B - Appendix'. These 
      R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed 
      in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement 
      Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 
      2015.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings for CNH Equipment Trust 2012-B:
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
