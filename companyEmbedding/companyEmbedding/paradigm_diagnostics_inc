Copy Number VariationsCNVs are alterations of the DNA of the cancer genome that result in the cell having abnormal copies of one or more sections of the DNA. These alterations can have a significant impact on response to therapy (e.g., HER2).mRNA ExpressionGene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional protein. Sequencing-based mRNA analysis enables the significant multiplexing of biomarker targets (e.g., ER, ERCC1).Protein ExpressionChanges in the protein expression as measured by IHC has been utilized for many years as the gold-standard to quantitate the actual translation of altered gene products. Our ability to interrogate key protein markers (e.g. PD-L1, HER2, AR, MGMT, TOP1) provides insights on potential response to both cytotoxic agents as well as emerging clinical trials.DNA MutationsChanges in the DNA sequence of chromosomes, including insertions, deletions and base substitutions. Somatic mutation analysis has become standard of practice for solid tumors in order to identify therapeutic sensitizing and resistance mutations (e.g., EGFR, KRAS, BRAF).

Specimen Preparation | Paradigm










































Access Results
Order PCDx






Get high quality results from FFPE specimens







Specimen Preparation
The recovery of quality DNA and RNA from FFPE (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) specimens can be challenging. A number of factors can impact the overall quality and yield of nucleic acids isolated from these preparations.
Continue reading 


Download these guidelines (PDF)

Download a PDF of Paradigm’s guidelines for FFPE specimen preparation for your convenience.
Download the PDF »






Smarter DNA/RNA/Protein recovery
Our specimen preparation recommendations address several key factors:




Tissue procurement and processing
Tissues should be fixed within one hour of surgical resection. The optimal total fixation time is 12-24 hours, using only neutral-buffered formalin. Fixed tissues should be thoroughly dehydrated prior to the embedding process.


Block storage
Storage of blocks without cut faces prevents ongoing damage from exposure to oxygen, water, light and other environmental factors.


Tissue type, size, and content
Excess non-malignant starting material will result in an effective dilution of targeted nucleic acids. When required, Paradigm employs Laser Capture Enrichment (LCE) to isolate and increase the specific microscopic subpopulations from FFPE tissue blocks.






Follow these guidelines for optimal results:



 

Sample Type

FFPE Block: Standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) block from most recent surgery or biopsy, containing the most amount of tissue, excluding bone.
Shaves/Curls: 6-10 10μm thick freshly cut curls along with H&E stained section of same block.
Slides:  (7-25) 4 micrometer, freshly cut, unstained, unbaked, sections on positively charged slides, or (1) Slide per IHC selected +1





 


 

Sample Size

Optimal: 75mm3 (5mm x 5mm x 3mm) or 4 to 6 needle biopsies
Minimum: One core needle with 10% tumor* (10mm x 2mm x 1mm)
(*risk that full profile cannot be completed)





 


 

Sample Tumor Content*

Optimal: 40% and higher
Minimum: 10% *Laser Capture Enrichment (LCE) will aid in specimen optimization

Solid tumor samples vary greatly from patient to patient and you may have unique challenges not covered here. Medical and scientific colleagues are available to answer questions about your specimen prior to sending sample. Please Client Services at (844) 232-4719.

Listeria and Salmonella Testing Company








PARADIGM DIAGNOSTICS INC.
Executive Summary

Paradigm Diagnostics Inc develops, manufactures and distributes high throughput microbiological screening tests, which are used to monitor the safety of food during processing.   Paradigm has developed and is currently selling diagnostic tests to the food processing industry that allow them to screen environmental samples for pathogens in-house.   The use of in-plant screening tests permits greater control over HACCP (Hazard Assessment Critical Control Point) information at a lower cost to the customer.


Traditional microbiological testing requires that tests for bacteria be selected and grown on more than one type of media (agar in most cases).   When using the traditional method, test results are seldom available in less than 48 hours and when the bacteria in question is a slow grower (such as Listeria), it can take up to five days to get test results.   This time delay is further compounded when sample analysis is conducted by outside reference or central laboratories.   Paradigm’s products address this situation at lower cost and with less need for a full-fledged microbiology laboratory at the customer’s facility.
 

Company Management

Dr. Alan Olstein founded Paradigm Diagnostics in 2001, and serves as the Company’s chief scientific officer. A mix of private and institutional investors funded the company.   The Company’s chief executive officer and chairman is Claire Johnson.
 

Paradigm’s Products


Paradigm has developed, tested, received approval from the AOAC Research Institute and is selling the first of its high-throughput pathogen screening tests.   PDX-LIB is a 40-hour test for the food pathogen, Listeria.   The test was developed for use in the manufacturing environment as opposed to testing the food product itself.   Listeria is considered an “indicator” organism in the food manufacturing facility.   If Listeria is found, it is an indication that other food pathogens may be present and sanitation operations need to be evaluated.   The test allows for detection of presumptively positive samples during the selective enrichment phase of all microbiological analyses, including modern immunoassay test and DNA amplification methods.   Identification of presumptive positive samples significantly reduces the environmental sample load submitted for testing at the reference laboratory. 

Paradigm has also developed a high-throughput test for the detection of Salmonella contamination.   The test is a simple single step indicator broth used to screen for Salmonella and is similar in concept and execution to the PDX-LIB product.   The product has been demonstrated to exhibit the requisite diagnostic performance parameters for sensitivity and specificity without the manipulations required of other commercially available products.   This test has been shown to be effective for use in environmental screening as well as for screening end product.   The test is in field trials to more accurately refine appropriate applications in the industry. 

Paradigm is actively engaged in the development of other new diagnostics for food safety applications.   The Company manufactures and markets its products through a mix of direct sales and distribution agreements.
