Mrs. C. Martin (Daphne) Wood III
Daphne Wood joined the Wildlife Foundation of Florida’s (WFF) Board of Directors in April 2003. Her service with the foundation is a natural extension of her lifelong commitment to promoting fish and wildlife conservation.
“I’m a great believer in consumptive use of renewable resources and support making recreational opportunities available whenever possible, without compromising the environment,” Wood said. “The Wildlife Foundation of Florida provides funding to critical research and projects our State needs to make ecologically-sound decisions.”
Wood is an officer and trustee of Tall Timbers Research Station (TTRS), an organization dedicated to fostering land stewardship. Actively involved with TTRS for 25 years, she is the chairwoman of the Easement Committee.
Wood’s other civic involvements include serving on the Thomasville (Georgia) Community Resource Center Board of Directors and the Executive Committee of the Foxhounds Association of North America.
Wood enjoys a variety of outdoor activities, including wildlife viewing, mounted fox hunting, and wing shooting.

Martco L.L.C. Announces Construction of OSB Plant in Corrigan, TX


Posted on February 24, 2015

Martco L.L.C. announced today the selection of Corrigan, Texas, as the location for a new, state-of-the-art oriented strand board (OSB) facility. The facility is expected to employ 165 people. Construction is scheduled to begin in the summer of 2015, with start-up anticipated by the fall of 2017. Corrigan OSB, L.L.C. will complement Martco L.L.C.’s existing wood-product manufacturing plants in Oakdale, Louisiana (OSB); Chopin, Louisiana (plywood); and Mexia, Alabama (lumber and timbers).
A versatile structural wood panel, OSB is commonly used in the construction of residential and multifamily housing, as well as in a variety of other applications. OSB panel products expected to be marketed under the RoyOMartin® brand at the Corrigan facility include Eclipse™ Radiant Barrier Roof Sheathing, Eclipse™ Reflective Housewrap, TuffStrand®, WindBrace®, and StructWall.
According to Martin Companies, L.L.C. Chairman and CEO Jonathan E. Martin, “Ever since my grandfather started out in the wood-product industry more than 90 years ago, our family has taken pride in utilizing raw materials to the fullest extent possible. This business model has led to Martco’s growth as a leading supplier in the wood-products industry. The timing is right for us to position ourselves to more effectively meet the increasing demand for building products into the foreseeable future.”
“We believe that East Texans have a tremendous amount of community passion, experience, and knowledge, and we look forward to becoming a proactive community partner,” adds Roy O. Martin III, president. “We will be working closely with the Corrigan-Camden Independent School District and Angelina College to develop a committed, competent workforce. We want to thank officials from the City of Corrigan, Polk County, and Corrigan-Camden ISD for their excellent work in bringing this facility to their area. Martco will extend its philosophy of being ‘employer of choice’ and ‘vendor of choice’ to this region, while maintaining the stability of a well-established, family-owned, professionally managed company committed to its stakeholders.”
Martco’s commitment to this region reaches beyond its future workforce. Senior Vice President and COO Scott Poole explains, “We look forward to extending our pride and dedication to sustainable forestry practices through additional foresters and loggers. With this expansion, we will continue to be good stewards of our forests, while delivering a full line of wood products across the country and world.”
