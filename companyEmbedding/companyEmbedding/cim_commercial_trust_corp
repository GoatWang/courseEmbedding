CIM Commercial Trust Corporation (CMCT) utilizes CIM Group's established investment approach to invest in stabilized real estate and real estate-related assets.


CMCT principally makes stabilized real estate investments in office properties through its manager, CIM Group, by relying on CIM’s urban investment strategy of qualifying communities for investment.  CIM’s qualified communities are located in both transitional urban districts as well as established, thriving urban areas that have a variety of resources and amenities instrumental to the communities’ vibrancy.  CIM utilizes its complementary investment vehicles to acquire various types of properties in a qualified community, with CMCT being the principal vehicle for office property assets.Since 1994, CIM has qualified more than 100 communities and has invested in approximately half of these. CIM’s community-focused approach, a critical component of CIM’s investment evaluation, has enabled CIM to enhance the value of assets to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in each of CIM’s complementary investment vehicles over the long term.  In particular, CIM’s stabilized real estate investments benefit from the investing, development, repositioning, and management activities of CIM’s opportunistic platform, which enhances overall community property values.CIM believes that improving demographics combined with public commitment and future investments in these urban qualified communities will provide greater returns compared to similar properties in other markets.
		







Small Business Administration Loans
CMCT deploys a portion of its capital to providing Small Business Administration 7(a)-guaranteed government loans as well as conventional loans to businesses throughout the United States through its wholly owned subsidiary lending business.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CIM Commercial Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
