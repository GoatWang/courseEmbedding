Virtus Timeline
 
 
Clients
Virtus has a large and growing client base consisting of many of the world’s largest banks, hedge funds and asset managers.  The deals that Virtus administers on behalf of these clients  typically have lives of 5-7 years and are recurring in nature.  Virtus is administering over 750 individual portfolios for 100 different managers.  Over half of our clients have multiple deals with Virtus and no client represents more than 20% of our portfolio.

Leadership
Virtus Partners was started in 2005 by its four partners who all remain actively engaged with the business on a daily basis. The name Virtus comes from ancient Rome and embodies concepts of excellence, character, and courage.  It took courage for the four founding partners to step out on their own and start a new firm that would fulfill their vision of an independent company that combined cutting edge technology and exceptional customer service would better serve their customers in the structured credit industry. Partners represents the founding partners, but also the partnership between the founders and their employees and again with the firm’s clients.
