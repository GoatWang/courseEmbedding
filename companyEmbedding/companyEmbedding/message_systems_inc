About Us











Powering 25% of the world's legitimate email
Message Systems email infrastructure software is the preferred choice of the world’s best known cloud businesses, email service providers, telecom companies and large enterprises that depend on email to drive revenue. Collectively, Message Systems customers, including LinkedIn, Twitter, Groupon, Salesforce, Marketo, Oracle, Time Warner, Comcast, AT&T and American Express, move over 3 trillion messages a year – more than 25 percent of the world’s legitimate email. These prestigious companies choose Message Systems because our software outperforms any cloud or on-premises alternative, and provides the flexibility, deliverability and control they need to drive the highest possible customer engagement for their business.​
Where we started
Our company was founded in the late 1990s by brothers George and Theo Schlossnagle with a very clear vision: to create a superior alternative to open-source MTA systems that were at the time the only viable choice for high volume email implementations. The solution they developed, the Momentum messaging platform, eliminated the rigid scalability, extensibility and management problems common with MTA-based architectures, all while driving down operating overhead and eliminating racks of servers at rates as high as 14-to-1. 
In November 2014 SparkPost, built by Message Systems, was made available in private beta. SparkPost puts the  power and functionality of our Momentum platform into the hands of developers at companies of all sizes in an easily accessible cloud solution. With SparkPost, they can  easily integrate pay-as-you-go email delivery into their web and mobile applications in minutes using a credit card.
With the acquisition of Port25 in February 2015, we added PowerMTA (PMTA) to our product family. This on-premises solution is a perfect complement to our  Momentum platform and further expanded our ability meet the email infrastructure needs of companies of all sizes who prefer an on-premises solution.
The road ahead
Since shipping our first product in 2001 – known as Ecelerity, the forerunner to Momentum – Message Systems has grown steadily into the global company we are today. Currently, more than 150 Message Systems employees work in our offices around the world, and we're adding new people all the time. In addition to our headquarters in Columbia, Maryland, we maintain U.S. offices in San Francisco and Seattle, and international offices in Europe.
From the start, Message Systems has relied on strong demand for our solutions and an expanding customer base to drive growth. In recent years strategic investments from NewSpring Ventures and LLR Partners have further strengthened our market position, helping to accelerate product development and international expansion. With our combination of best-in-class technology, unrivaled industry expertise and passionate, dedicated people, Message Systems is determined to continue innovating, and maintaining our solutions as the standard against which all other messaging products are measured.

About Us











Powering 25% of the world's legitimate email
Message Systems email infrastructure software is the preferred choice of the world’s best known cloud businesses, email service providers, telecom companies and large enterprises that depend on email to drive revenue. Collectively, Message Systems customers, including LinkedIn, Twitter, Groupon, Salesforce, Marketo, Oracle, Time Warner, Comcast, AT&T and American Express, move over 3 trillion messages a year – more than 25 percent of the world’s legitimate email. These prestigious companies choose Message Systems because our software outperforms any cloud or on-premises alternative, and provides the flexibility, deliverability and control they need to drive the highest possible customer engagement for their business.​
Where we started
Our company was founded in the late 1990s by brothers George and Theo Schlossnagle with a very clear vision: to create a superior alternative to open-source MTA systems that were at the time the only viable choice for high volume email implementations. The solution they developed, the Momentum messaging platform, eliminated the rigid scalability, extensibility and management problems common with MTA-based architectures, all while driving down operating overhead and eliminating racks of servers at rates as high as 14-to-1. 
In November 2014 SparkPost, built by Message Systems, was made available in private beta. SparkPost puts the  power and functionality of our Momentum platform into the hands of developers at companies of all sizes in an easily accessible cloud solution. With SparkPost, they can  easily integrate pay-as-you-go email delivery into their web and mobile applications in minutes using a credit card.
With the acquisition of Port25 in February 2015, we added PowerMTA (PMTA) to our product family. This on-premises solution is a perfect complement to our  Momentum platform and further expanded our ability meet the email infrastructure needs of companies of all sizes who prefer an on-premises solution.
The road ahead
Since shipping our first product in 2001 – known as Ecelerity, the forerunner to Momentum – Message Systems has grown steadily into the global company we are today. Currently, more than 150 Message Systems employees work in our offices around the world, and we're adding new people all the time. In addition to our headquarters in Columbia, Maryland, we maintain U.S. offices in San Francisco and Seattle, and international offices in Europe.
From the start, Message Systems has relied on strong demand for our solutions and an expanding customer base to drive growth. In recent years strategic investments from NewSpring Ventures and LLR Partners have further strengthened our market position, helping to accelerate product development and international expansion. With our combination of best-in-class technology, unrivaled industry expertise and passionate, dedicated people, Message Systems is determined to continue innovating, and maintaining our solutions as the standard against which all other messaging products are measured.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
