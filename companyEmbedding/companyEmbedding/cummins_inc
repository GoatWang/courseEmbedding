History[edit]

Columbus main plant (1973)


The Cummins Engine Company was founded in Columbus, Indiana, in 1919 by Clessie Cummins, a local mechanic. It focused on developing the diesel engine invented 20 years earlier, but in spite of several well publicized endurance trials it was not until 1933 that their Model H, used in small railroad switchers, proved successful.[5][6][7] In the post-World War II U.S. road building boom Cummins N Series engines became the industry leader, with more than half the heavy duty truck market from 1952 to 1959.[8] In the 1960s the company opened an assembly plant in Shotts, Scotland. By 2013 they had operations in 197 countries and territories.[7]
Business units[edit]
Cummins Engine Business[edit]
Cummins Engine Business Unit consists of Aftermarket support, Mid-Range, Heavy-Duty, and High-Horsepower Engines. Cummins manufactures and markets a complete line of diesel and natural gas-powered engines for on-highway and off-highway use. Its markets include heavy-and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive and a number of industrial uses including, construction, mining, marine, oil and gas, railroad and military equipment.[2]
For the general public, the most visible Cummins product may be the 5.9-liter in-line six-cylinder engine used in the Dodge Ram light duty pickups starting in 1989.[9] In 2007, a 6.7-liter version of the Cummins straight six engine became optional on the RAM pickup.[9] In 2008, Cummins was a named defendant in a class action suit related to 1998-2001 model year Chrysler Dodge Ram trucks, model 2500 or 3500, originally equipped with a Cummins ISB 5.9 liter diesel engine built using a pattern 53 Block.[10] The case has been settled, but some qualified Chrysler owners may receive $500 for repairs to the block, which was alleged to crack and create a coolant leak.
In April 2013, Cummins utilized technology developed by Westport Innovations to begin shipping large natural gas fueled engines to truck manufacturers in the United States as trucking companies began converting portions of their fleets to natural gas and the natural gas distribution network in the United States began to expand.[11]
Cummins has a Technical Centre in Darlington UK, where it develops products for the European, Middle Eastern and Asian markets.

Cummins Turbo Technologies[edit]
The Holset Engineering Co. was a British company that produced turbochargers, primarily for diesel and heavy duty application
In 1973 the company was purchased by Cummins after briefly being owned by the Hanson Trust. Holset now operates facilities in China, India, Brazil, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
In 2006, the division officially changed its name to Cummins Turbo Technologies to be identified more closely with its parent company. The turbocharger products still use the Holset brand name.
Cummins Power Systems[edit]
In 1986, Cummins began acquisition of Onan and completed it in 1992. Since then, Onan has evolved into Cummins Power Generation ( now Cummins Power Systems), a wholly invested division of Cummins. The Onan name continues to be used for modern versions of their traditional engine-driven generators for RV, marine, commercial mobility, home standby, and portable use.
Cummins Emission Solutions[edit]
Exhaust and emissions after-treatment company Nelson Industries was purchased in 1999, due to the increasing importance of exhaust after-treatment systems for meeting future emissions standards. The division officially changed its name to Cummins Emission Solutions, in order to be identified more closely with their parent company.
India operations[edit]
Cummins began its India operations on 17 February 1962 in a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group. The ownership structure of the joint venture was divided as follows:

Cummins - 50%
Kirloskar Group - 25.5%
Retail Investors - 24.5%

As of 2013, the Cummins group had revenues of over $1.5 billion, 20 factories and 9000 employees in India.
Cummins does a significant part of its R&D in India at the Cummins Research and Technology centre that was set up in 2003. Also, Cummins is building an advanced technical centre in Pune which will house over 2000 engineers.[12]
Cummins India has also made significant contributions to local skill development by establishing the MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women, a women-only engineering college in Pune.[13]

History[edit]




An early Cummins diesel in a 1950 Indianapolis 500 roadster






Columbus main plant (1973)


The Cummins Engine Company was founded in Columbus, Indiana, in 1919 by Clessie Cummins, a local mechanic. It focused on developing the diesel engine invented 20 years earlier, but in spite of several well publicized endurance trials it was not until 1933 that their Model H, used in small railroad switchers, proved successful.[5][6][7] In the post-World War II U.S. road building boom Cummins N Series engines became the industry leader, with more than half the heavy duty truck market from 1952 to 1959.[8] In the 1960s the company opened an assembly plant in Shotts, Scotland. By 2013 they had operations in 197 countries and territories.[7]
Business units[edit]
Cummins Engine Business[edit]
Cummins Engine Business Unit consists of Aftermarket support, Mid-Range, Heavy-Duty, and High-Horsepower Engines. Cummins manufactures and markets a complete line of diesel and natural gas-powered engines for on-highway and off-highway use. Its markets include heavy-and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive and a number of industrial uses including, construction, mining, marine, oil and gas, railroad and military equipment.[2]
For the general public, the most visible Cummins product may be the 5.9-liter in-line six-cylinder engine used in the Dodge Ram light duty pickups starting in 1989.[9] In 2007, a 6.7-liter version of the Cummins straight six engine became optional on the RAM pickup.[9] In 2008, Cummins was a named defendant in a class action suit related to 1998-2001 model year Chrysler Dodge Ram trucks, model 2500 or 3500, originally equipped with a Cummins ISB 5.9 liter diesel engine built using a pattern 53 Block.[10] The case has been settled, but some qualified Chrysler owners may receive $500 for repairs to the block, which was alleged to crack and create a coolant leak.
In April 2013, Cummins utilized technology developed by Westport Innovations to begin shipping large natural gas fueled engines to truck manufacturers in the United States as trucking companies began converting portions of their fleets to natural gas and the natural gas distribution network in the United States began to expand.[11]
Cummins has a Technical Centre in Darlington UK, where it develops products for the European, Middle Eastern and Asian markets.
Cummins Power Systems Business (formerly Cummins Power Generation)[edit]

Cummins Power Systems Business Unit consists of Alternators, Automatic Transfer Switches, Commercial Power Systems, Consumer Systems, Engines, and Paralleling Systems. Cummins Power Systems is a global provider of power generation systems, components and services in standby power, distributed power generation, as well as auxiliary power in mobile applications to meet the needs of a diversified customer base.
All of the above solutions stem from Cummins Onan, of which products are still in service today.
This Business Unit was formed recently, following a merge of the Power Generation Unit and High Horsepower Sub-Division.

Cummins Component Business[edit]
Cummins Component Business Unit consists of Emission Solutions, Filtration (Fleetguard), Fuel Systems, Turbo Technologies (Holset), and Electronics. With regards to Turbo Technologies, Cummins designs and manufactures turbochargers and related products, on a global scale, for diesel engines above 3 liters. In regard to Emission Solutions, Cummins develops and supplies catalytic exhaust systems and related products to the medium-and heavy-duty commercial diesel engine markets. In regard to Filtration, Cummins designs, manufactures and distributes heavy-duty and light-duty air, fuel, hydraulic and lube filtration, chemicals and exhaust system technology products for diesel and gas-powered equipment. With regards to Electronics, Cummins designs engine control units and sensors for Cummins diesel engines.
Cummins Distribution Business[edit]
Cummins Distribution Business consists of Engine and Power Generation Distribution as well as Service and Parts. The distribution unit of Cummins consists of 17 Cummins owned distributors and 10 joint ventures, covering 90 countries and territories through 234 locations.
Subsidiaries[edit]

Cummins Turbo Technologies[edit]
The Holset Engineering Co. was a British company that produced turbochargers, primarily for diesel and heavy duty application
In 1973 the company was purchased by Cummins after briefly being owned by the Hanson Trust. Holset now operates facilities in China, India, Brazil, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
In 2006, the division officially changed its name to Cummins Turbo Technologies to be identified more closely with its parent company. The turbocharger products still use the Holset brand name.
Cummins Power Systems[edit]
In 1986, Cummins began acquisition of Onan and completed it in 1992. Since then, Onan has evolved into Cummins Power Generation ( now Cummins Power Systems), a wholly invested division of Cummins. The Onan name continues to be used for modern versions of their traditional engine-driven generators for RV, marine, commercial mobility, home standby, and portable use.
Cummins Emission Solutions[edit]
Exhaust and emissions after-treatment company Nelson Industries was purchased in 1999, due to the increasing importance of exhaust after-treatment systems for meeting future emissions standards. The division officially changed its name to Cummins Emission Solutions, in order to be identified more closely with their parent company.
India operations[edit]
Cummins began its India operations on 17 February 1962 in a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group. The ownership structure of the joint venture was divided as follows:

Cummins - 50%
Kirloskar Group - 25.5%
Retail Investors - 24.5%

As of 2013, the Cummins group had revenues of over $1.5 billion, 20 factories and 9000 employees in India.
Cummins does a significant part of its R&D in India at the Cummins Research and Technology centre that was set up in 2003. Also, Cummins is building an advanced technical centre in Pune which will house over 2000 engineers.[12]
Cummins India has also made significant contributions to local skill development by establishing the MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women, a women-only engineering college in Pune.[13]

It focused on developing the diesel engine invented 20 years earlier, but in spite of several well publicized endurance trials it was not until 1933 that their Model H, used in small railroad switchers, proved successful.[5][6][7] In the post-World War II U.S. road building boom Cummins N Series engines became the industry leader, with more than half the heavy duty truck market from 1952 to 1959.[8] In the 1960s the company opened an assembly plant in Shotts, Scotland. By 2013 they had operations in 197 countries and territories.[7]
Business units[edit]
Cummins Engine Business[edit]
Cummins Engine Business Unit consists of Aftermarket support, Mid-Range, Heavy-Duty, and High-Horsepower Engines. Cummins manufactures and markets a complete line of diesel and natural gas-powered engines for on-highway and off-highway use. Its markets include heavy-and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive and a number of industrial uses including, construction, mining, marine, oil and gas, railroad and military equipment.[2]
For the general public, the most visible Cummins product may be the 5.9-liter in-line six-cylinder engine used in the Dodge Ram light duty pickups starting in 1989.[9] In 2007, a 6.7-liter version of the Cummins straight six engine became optional on the RAM pickup.[9] In 2008, Cummins was a named defendant in a class action suit related to 1998-2001 model year Chrysler Dodge Ram trucks, model 2500 or 3500, originally equipped with a Cummins ISB 5.9 liter diesel engine built using a pattern 53 Block.[10] The case has been settled, but some qualified Chrysler owners may receive $500 for repairs to the block, which was alleged to crack and create a coolant leak.
In April 2013, Cummins utilized technology developed by Westport Innovations to begin shipping large natural gas fueled engines to truck manufacturers in the United States as trucking companies began converting portions of their fleets to natural gas and the natural gas distribution network in the United States began to expand.[11]
Cummins has a Technical Centre in Darlington UK, where it develops products for the European, Middle Eastern and Asian markets.

Cummins Turbo Technologies[edit]
The Holset Engineering Co. was a British company that produced turbochargers, primarily for diesel and heavy duty application
In 1973 the company was purchased by Cummins after briefly being owned by the Hanson Trust. Holset now operates facilities in China, India, Brazil, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
In 2006, the division officially changed its name to Cummins Turbo Technologies to be identified more closely with its parent company. The turbocharger products still use the Holset brand name.
Cummins Power Systems[edit]
In 1986, Cummins began acquisition of Onan and completed it in 1992. Since then, Onan has evolved into Cummins Power Generation ( now Cummins Power Systems), a wholly invested division of Cummins. The Onan name continues to be used for modern versions of their traditional engine-driven generators for RV, marine, commercial mobility, home standby, and portable use.
Cummins Emission Solutions[edit]
Exhaust and emissions after-treatment company Nelson Industries was purchased in 1999, due to the increasing importance of exhaust after-treatment systems for meeting future emissions standards. The division officially changed its name to Cummins Emission Solutions, in order to be identified more closely with their parent company.
India operations[edit]
Cummins began its India operations on 17 February 1962 in a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group. The ownership structure of the joint venture was divided as follows:

Cummins - 50%
Kirloskar Group - 25.5%
Retail Investors - 24.5%

As of 2013, the Cummins group had revenues of over $1.5 billion, 20 factories and 9000 employees in India.
Cummins does a significant part of its R&D in India at the Cummins Research and Technology centre that was set up in 2003. Also, Cummins is building an advanced technical centre in Pune which will house over 2000 engineers.[12]
Cummins India has also made significant contributions to local skill development by establishing the MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women, a women-only engineering college in Pune.[13]

History[edit]




An early Cummins diesel in a 1950 Indianapolis 500 roadster






Columbus main plant (1973)


The Cummins Engine Company was founded in Columbus, Indiana, in 1919 by Clessie Cummins, a local mechanic. It focused on developing the diesel engine invented 20 years earlier, but in spite of several well publicized endurance trials it was not until 1933 that their Model H, used in small railroad switchers, proved successful.[5][6][7] In the post-World War II U.S. road building boom Cummins N Series engines became the industry leader, with more than half the heavy duty truck market from 1952 to 1959.[8] In the 1960s the company opened an assembly plant in Shotts, Scotland. By 2013 they had operations in 197 countries and territories.[7]
Business units[edit]
Cummins Engine Business[edit]
Cummins Engine Business Unit consists of Aftermarket support, Mid-Range, Heavy-Duty, and High-Horsepower Engines. Cummins manufactures and markets a complete line of diesel and natural gas-powered engines for on-highway and off-highway use. Its markets include heavy-and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive and a number of industrial uses including, construction, mining, marine, oil and gas, railroad and military equipment.[2]
For the general public, the most visible Cummins product may be the 5.9-liter in-line six-cylinder engine used in the Dodge Ram light duty pickups starting in 1989.[9] In 2007, a 6.7-liter version of the Cummins straight six engine became optional on the RAM pickup.[9] In 2008, Cummins was a named defendant in a class action suit related to 1998-2001 model year Chrysler Dodge Ram trucks, model 2500 or 3500, originally equipped with a Cummins ISB 5.9 liter diesel engine built using a pattern 53 Block.[10] The case has been settled, but some qualified Chrysler owners may receive $500 for repairs to the block, which was alleged to crack and create a coolant leak.
In April 2013, Cummins utilized technology developed by Westport Innovations to begin shipping large natural gas fueled engines to truck manufacturers in the United States as trucking companies began converting portions of their fleets to natural gas and the natural gas distribution network in the United States began to expand.[11]
Cummins has a Technical Centre in Darlington UK, where it develops products for the European, Middle Eastern and Asian markets.
Cummins Power Systems Business (formerly Cummins Power Generation)[edit]

Cummins Power Systems Business Unit consists of Alternators, Automatic Transfer Switches, Commercial Power Systems, Consumer Systems, Engines, and Paralleling Systems. Cummins Power Systems is a global provider of power generation systems, components and services in standby power, distributed power generation, as well as auxiliary power in mobile applications to meet the needs of a diversified customer base.
All of the above solutions stem from Cummins Onan, of which products are still in service today.
This Business Unit was formed recently, following a merge of the Power Generation Unit and High Horsepower Sub-Division.

Cummins Component Business[edit]
Cummins Component Business Unit consists of Emission Solutions, Filtration (Fleetguard), Fuel Systems, Turbo Technologies (Holset), and Electronics. With regards to Turbo Technologies, Cummins designs and manufactures turbochargers and related products, on a global scale, for diesel engines above 3 liters. In regard to Emission Solutions, Cummins develops and supplies catalytic exhaust systems and related products to the medium-and heavy-duty commercial diesel engine markets. In regard to Filtration, Cummins designs, manufactures and distributes heavy-duty and light-duty air, fuel, hydraulic and lube filtration, chemicals and exhaust system technology products for diesel and gas-powered equipment. With regards to Electronics, Cummins designs engine control units and sensors for Cummins diesel engines.
Cummins Distribution Business[edit]
Cummins Distribution Business consists of Engine and Power Generation Distribution as well as Service and Parts. The distribution unit of Cummins consists of 17 Cummins owned distributors and 10 joint ventures, covering 90 countries and territories through 234 locations.
Subsidiaries[edit]




Holset turbocharger (x2), on 450 hp (340 kW) V12 Kromhout diesel engine


Cummins Turbo Technologies[edit]
The Holset Engineering Co. was a British company that produced turbochargers, primarily for diesel and heavy duty application
In 1973 the company was purchased by Cummins after briefly being owned by the Hanson Trust. Holset now operates facilities in China, India, Brazil, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
In 2006, the division officially changed its name to Cummins Turbo Technologies to be identified more closely with its parent company. The turbocharger products still use the Holset brand name.
Cummins Power Systems[edit]
In 1986, Cummins began acquisition of Onan and completed it in 1992. Since then, Onan has evolved into Cummins Power Generation ( now Cummins Power Systems), a wholly invested division of Cummins. The Onan name continues to be used for modern versions of their traditional engine-driven generators for RV, marine, commercial mobility, home standby, and portable use.
Cummins Emission Solutions[edit]
Exhaust and emissions after-treatment company Nelson Industries was purchased in 1999, due to the increasing importance of exhaust after-treatment systems for meeting future emissions standards. The division officially changed its name to Cummins Emission Solutions, in order to be identified more closely with their parent company.
India operations[edit]
Cummins began its India operations on 17 February 1962 in a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group. The ownership structure of the joint venture was divided as follows:

Cummins - 50%
Kirloskar Group - 25.5%
Retail Investors - 24.5%

As of 2013, the Cummins group had revenues of over $1.5 billion, 20 factories and 9000 employees in India.
Cummins does a significant part of its R&D in India at the Cummins Research and Technology centre that was set up in 2003. Also, Cummins is building an advanced technical centre in Pune which will house over 2000 engineers.[12]
Cummins India has also made significant contributions to local skill development by establishing the MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women, a women-only engineering college in Pune.[13]

Engines














Why the change?
Cummins global products are being redefined by higher efficiency, reliability, and stronger performance. Our product development is no longer led by emissions, but is instead inspired by customer and application needs. With this paradigm shift, we seized the opportunity to introduce a fresh and bold engine naming system to highlight our newest products and re-energize the Cummins brand.
Cummins updated engine marketing nomenclature is unique and scalable, while continuing to build upon our history and establishing consistency through natural product categories used previously. Adhering to the standards outlined here will strengthen the Cummins brand and minimize risk of rogue product names being released.
These marketing nomenclature standards are global in nature and apply to all Cummins engines, regardless of country, region or application. The new global engine names will roll out with all new platforms and significant product or emission changes. Any products in production before 2017 will keep their original names and are not within the scope of the engine nomenclature change. Current names like ISG, ISX15 and ISB6.7 will remain the same. The new marketing name will be applied only to new production products and the rollout schedule for product name changes will develop as needed, in alignment with product plans.
 






    Engine Naming Standards  
 



  
  
  
  




  
  
  
  



  
  
  
  




  



 
    Font & Style Guidelines  
 



 1919, a unique custom font, has been designed to accompany the introduction of Cummins updated engine marketing nomenclature, and standardize engine badge style for Cummins engines across all global markets. The lettering style is a custom design that cannot be purchased or installed on personal computers.
The intent of the standards on the following pages is to control and limit the application of 1919 in order to develop a positive association with Cummins products and brand, and to avoid overuse in ways that diminish the appearance of Cummins brand icons and to protect against the potential misuse or infringement on the Cummins brand.
 
  
  
  




  
  
  
  



  
  
  
  




  



 
    Usage Guidelines  
 



 Using Engine Names
As part of the normal marketing launch process, all marketing materials including literature, web content, presentations, product training materials, images, advertisements, etc. will incorporate the new naming structure. Customer-facing employees should be sure to communicate this update to their customers. Any time you discuss our engines outside of Cummins, including presentations, documents and any interaction with customers, the engine marketing name should appear as outlined in this guide, and not be altered in any way unless an exception has been approved.
Using 1919 Font vs. Standard Font
For the majority of materials that follow the brand standard format, such as Microsoft PowerPoint slides and brochures, the standard font used for headlines and text should not be replaced with the 1919 font. 1919 is to be used only for new engine names and no other products or services.

In special cases, approval may be granted to use descriptors in a way that complements the engine marketing name. Any change to the engine marketing nomenclature requires review and approval by Cummins Brand Council.
Any questions regarding this process should be directed to the Brand Council.

History[edit]




An early Cummins diesel in a 1950 Indianapolis 500 roadster






Columbus main plant (1973)


The Cummins Engine Company was founded in Columbus, Indiana, in 1919 by Clessie Cummins, a local mechanic. It focused on developing the diesel engine invented 20 years earlier, but in spite of several well publicized endurance trials it was not until 1933 that their Model H, used in small railroad switchers, proved successful.[5][6][7] In the post-World War II U.S. road building boom Cummins N Series engines became the industry leader, with more than half the heavy duty truck market from 1952 to 1959.[8] In the 1960s the company opened an assembly plant in Shotts, Scotland. By 2013 they had operations in 197 countries and territories.[7]
Business units[edit]
Cummins Engine Business[edit]
Cummins Engine Business Unit consists of Aftermarket support, Mid-Range, Heavy-Duty, and High-Horsepower Engines. Cummins manufactures and markets a complete line of diesel and natural gas-powered engines for on-highway and off-highway use. Its markets include heavy-and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive and a number of industrial uses including, construction, mining, marine, oil and gas, railroad and military equipment.[2]
For the general public, the most visible Cummins product may be the 5.9-liter in-line six-cylinder engine used in the Dodge Ram light duty pickups starting in 1989.[9] In 2007, a 6.7-liter version of the Cummins straight six engine became optional on the RAM pickup.[9] In 2008, Cummins was a named defendant in a class action suit related to 1998-2001 model year Chrysler Dodge Ram trucks, model 2500 or 3500, originally equipped with a Cummins ISB 5.9 liter diesel engine built using a pattern 53 Block.[10] The case has been settled, but some qualified Chrysler owners may receive $500 for repairs to the block, which was alleged to crack and create a coolant leak.
In April 2013, Cummins utilized technology developed by Westport Innovations to begin shipping large natural gas fueled engines to truck manufacturers in the United States as trucking companies began converting portions of their fleets to natural gas and the natural gas distribution network in the United States began to expand.[11]
Cummins has a Technical Centre in Darlington UK, where it develops products for the European, Middle Eastern and Asian markets.
Cummins Power Systems Business (formerly Cummins Power Generation)[edit]

Cummins Power Systems Business Unit consists of Alternators, Automatic Transfer Switches, Commercial Power Systems, Consumer Systems, Engines, and Paralleling Systems. Cummins Power Systems is a global provider of power generation systems, components and services in standby power, distributed power generation, as well as auxiliary power in mobile applications to meet the needs of a diversified customer base.
All of the above solutions stem from Cummins Onan, of which products are still in service today.
This Business Unit was formed recently, following a merge of the Power Generation Unit and High Horsepower Sub-Division.

Cummins Component Business[edit]
Cummins Component Business Unit consists of Emission Solutions, Filtration (Fleetguard), Fuel Systems, Turbo Technologies (Holset), and Electronics. With regards to Turbo Technologies, Cummins designs and manufactures turbochargers and related products, on a global scale, for diesel engines above 3 liters. In regard to Emission Solutions, Cummins develops and supplies catalytic exhaust systems and related products to the medium-and heavy-duty commercial diesel engine markets. In regard to Filtration, Cummins designs, manufactures and distributes heavy-duty and light-duty air, fuel, hydraulic and lube filtration, chemicals and exhaust system technology products for diesel and gas-powered equipment. With regards to Electronics, Cummins designs engine control units and sensors for Cummins diesel engines.
Cummins Distribution Business[edit]
Cummins Distribution Business consists of Engine and Power Generation Distribution as well as Service and Parts. The distribution unit of Cummins consists of 17 Cummins owned distributors and 10 joint ventures, covering 90 countries and territories through 234 locations.
Subsidiaries[edit]




Holset turbocharger (x2), on 450 hp (340 kW) V12 Kromhout diesel engine


Cummins Turbo Technologies[edit]
The Holset Engineering Co. was a British company that produced turbochargers, primarily for diesel and heavy duty application
In 1973 the company was purchased by Cummins after briefly being owned by the Hanson Trust. Holset now operates facilities in China, India, Brazil, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
In 2006, the division officially changed its name to Cummins Turbo Technologies to be identified more closely with its parent company. The turbocharger products still use the Holset brand name.
Cummins Power Systems[edit]
In 1986, Cummins began acquisition of Onan and completed it in 1992. Since then, Onan has evolved into Cummins Power Generation ( now Cummins Power Systems), a wholly invested division of Cummins. The Onan name continues to be used for modern versions of their traditional engine-driven generators for RV, marine, commercial mobility, home standby, and portable use.
Cummins Emission Solutions[edit]
Exhaust and emissions after-treatment company Nelson Industries was purchased in 1999, due to the increasing importance of exhaust after-treatment systems for meeting future emissions standards. The division officially changed its name to Cummins Emission Solutions, in order to be identified more closely with their parent company.
India operations[edit]
Cummins began its India operations on 17 February 1962 in a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group. The ownership structure of the joint venture was divided as follows:

Cummins - 50%
Kirloskar Group - 25.5%
Retail Investors - 24.5%

As of 2013, the Cummins group had revenues of over $1.5 billion, 20 factories and 9000 employees in India.
Cummins does a significant part of its R&D in India at the Cummins Research and Technology centre that was set up in 2003. Also, Cummins is building an advanced technical centre in Pune which will house over 2000 engineers.[12]
Cummins India has also made significant contributions to local skill development by establishing the MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women, a women-only engineering college in Pune.[13]

History[edit]




An early Cummins diesel in a 1950 Indianapolis 500 roadster






Columbus main plant (1973)


The Cummins Engine Company was founded in Columbus, Indiana, in 1919 by Clessie Cummins, a local mechanic. It focused on developing the diesel engine invented 20 years earlier, but in spite of several well publicized endurance trials it was not until 1933 that their Model H, used in small railroad switchers, proved successful.[5][6][7] In the post-World War II U.S. road building boom Cummins N Series engines became the industry leader, with more than half the heavy duty truck market from 1952 to 1959.[8] In the 1960s the company opened an assembly plant in Shotts, Scotland. By 2013 they had operations in 197 countries and territories.[7]
Business units[edit]
Cummins Engine Business[edit]
Cummins Engine Business Unit consists of Aftermarket support, Mid-Range, Heavy-Duty, and High-Horsepower Engines. Cummins manufactures and markets a complete line of diesel and natural gas-powered engines for on-highway and off-highway use. Its markets include heavy-and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive and a number of industrial uses including, construction, mining, marine, oil and gas, railroad and military equipment.[2]
For the general public, the most visible Cummins product may be the 5.9-liter in-line six-cylinder engine used in the Dodge Ram light duty pickups starting in 1989.[9] In 2007, a 6.7-liter version of the Cummins straight six engine became optional on the RAM pickup.[9] In 2008, Cummins was a named defendant in a class action suit related to 1998-2001 model year Chrysler Dodge Ram trucks, model 2500 or 3500, originally equipped with a Cummins ISB 5.9 liter diesel engine built using a pattern 53 Block.[10] The case has been settled, but some qualified Chrysler owners may receive $500 for repairs to the block, which was alleged to crack and create a coolant leak.
In April 2013, Cummins utilized technology developed by Westport Innovations to begin shipping large natural gas fueled engines to truck manufacturers in the United States as trucking companies began converting portions of their fleets to natural gas and the natural gas distribution network in the United States began to expand.[11]
Cummins has a Technical Centre in Darlington UK, where it develops products for the European, Middle Eastern and Asian markets.
Cummins Power Systems Business (formerly Cummins Power Generation)[edit]

Cummins Power Systems Business Unit consists of Alternators, Automatic Transfer Switches, Commercial Power Systems, Consumer Systems, Engines, and Paralleling Systems. Cummins Power Systems is a global provider of power generation systems, components and services in standby power, distributed power generation, as well as auxiliary power in mobile applications to meet the needs of a diversified customer base.
All of the above solutions stem from Cummins Onan, of which products are still in service today.
This Business Unit was formed recently, following a merge of the Power Generation Unit and High Horsepower Sub-Division.

Cummins Component Business[edit]
Cummins Component Business Unit consists of Emission Solutions, Filtration (Fleetguard), Fuel Systems, Turbo Technologies (Holset), and Electronics. With regards to Turbo Technologies, Cummins designs and manufactures turbochargers and related products, on a global scale, for diesel engines above 3 liters. In regard to Emission Solutions, Cummins develops and supplies catalytic exhaust systems and related products to the medium-and heavy-duty commercial diesel engine markets. In regard to Filtration, Cummins designs, manufactures and distributes heavy-duty and light-duty air, fuel, hydraulic and lube filtration, chemicals and exhaust system technology products for diesel and gas-powered equipment. With regards to Electronics, Cummins designs engine control units and sensors for Cummins diesel engines.
Cummins Distribution Business[edit]
Cummins Distribution Business consists of Engine and Power Generation Distribution as well as Service and Parts. The distribution unit of Cummins consists of 17 Cummins owned distributors and 10 joint ventures, covering 90 countries and territories through 234 locations.
Subsidiaries[edit]




Holset turbocharger (x2), on 450 hp (340 kW) V12 Kromhout diesel engine


Cummins Turbo Technologies[edit]
The Holset Engineering Co. was a British company that produced turbochargers, primarily for diesel and heavy duty application
In 1973 the company was purchased by Cummins after briefly being owned by the Hanson Trust. Holset now operates facilities in China, India, Brazil, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
In 2006, the division officially changed its name to Cummins Turbo Technologies to be identified more closely with its parent company. The turbocharger products still use the Holset brand name.
Cummins Power Systems[edit]
In 1986, Cummins began acquisition of Onan and completed it in 1992. Since then, Onan has evolved into Cummins Power Generation ( now Cummins Power Systems), a wholly invested division of Cummins. The Onan name continues to be used for modern versions of their traditional engine-driven generators for RV, marine, commercial mobility, home standby, and portable use.
Cummins Emission Solutions[edit]
Exhaust and emissions after-treatment company Nelson Industries was purchased in 1999, due to the increasing importance of exhaust after-treatment systems for meeting future emissions standards. The division officially changed its name to Cummins Emission Solutions, in order to be identified more closely with their parent company.
India operations[edit]
Cummins began its India operations on 17 February 1962 in a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group. The ownership structure of the joint venture was divided as follows:

Cummins - 50%
Kirloskar Group - 25.5%
Retail Investors - 24.5%

As of 2013, the Cummins group had revenues of over $1.5 billion, 20 factories and 9000 employees in India.
Cummins does a significant part of its R&D in India at the Cummins Research and Technology centre that was set up in 2003. Also, Cummins is building an advanced technical centre in Pune which will house over 2000 engineers.[12]
Cummins India has also made significant contributions to local skill development by establishing the MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women, a women-only engineering college in Pune.[13]

History[edit]




An early Cummins diesel in a 1950 Indianapolis 500 roadster






Columbus main plant (1973)


The Cummins Engine Company was founded in Columbus, Indiana, in 1919 by Clessie Cummins, a local mechanic. It focused on developing the diesel engine invented 20 years earlier, but in spite of several well publicized endurance trials it was not until 1933 that their Model H, used in small railroad switchers, proved successful.[5][6][7] In the post-World War II U.S. road building boom Cummins N Series engines became the industry leader, with more than half the heavy duty truck market from 1952 to 1959.[8] In the 1960s the company opened an assembly plant in Shotts, Scotland. By 2013 they had operations in 197 countries and territories.[7]
Business units[edit]
Cummins Engine Business[edit]
Cummins Engine Business Unit consists of Aftermarket support, Mid-Range, Heavy-Duty, and High-Horsepower Engines. Cummins manufactures and markets a complete line of diesel and natural gas-powered engines for on-highway and off-highway use. Its markets include heavy-and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive and a number of industrial uses including, construction, mining, marine, oil and gas, railroad and military equipment.[2]
For the general public, the most visible Cummins product may be the 5.9-liter in-line six-cylinder engine used in the Dodge Ram light duty pickups starting in 1989.[9] In 2007, a 6.7-liter version of the Cummins straight six engine became optional on the RAM pickup.[9] In 2008, Cummins was a named defendant in a class action suit related to 1998-2001 model year Chrysler Dodge Ram trucks, model 2500 or 3500, originally equipped with a Cummins ISB 5.9 liter diesel engine built using a pattern 53 Block.[10] The case has been settled, but some qualified Chrysler owners may receive $500 for repairs to the block, which was alleged to crack and create a coolant leak.
In April 2013, Cummins utilized technology developed by Westport Innovations to begin shipping large natural gas fueled engines to truck manufacturers in the United States as trucking companies began converting portions of their fleets to natural gas and the natural gas distribution network in the United States began to expand.[11]
Cummins has a Technical Centre in Darlington UK, where it develops products for the European, Middle Eastern and Asian markets.
Cummins Power Systems Business (formerly Cummins Power Generation)[edit]

Cummins Power Systems Business Unit consists of Alternators, Automatic Transfer Switches, Commercial Power Systems, Consumer Systems, Engines, and Paralleling Systems. Cummins Power Systems is a global provider of power generation systems, components and services in standby power, distributed power generation, as well as auxiliary power in mobile applications to meet the needs of a diversified customer base.
All of the above solutions stem from Cummins Onan, of which products are still in service today.
This Business Unit was formed recently, following a merge of the Power Generation Unit and High Horsepower Sub-Division.

Cummins Component Business[edit]
Cummins Component Business Unit consists of Emission Solutions, Filtration (Fleetguard), Fuel Systems, Turbo Technologies (Holset), and Electronics. With regards to Turbo Technologies, Cummins designs and manufactures turbochargers and related products, on a global scale, for diesel engines above 3 liters. In regard to Emission Solutions, Cummins develops and supplies catalytic exhaust systems and related products to the medium-and heavy-duty commercial diesel engine markets. In regard to Filtration, Cummins designs, manufactures and distributes heavy-duty and light-duty air, fuel, hydraulic and lube filtration, chemicals and exhaust system technology products for diesel and gas-powered equipment. With regards to Electronics, Cummins designs engine control units and sensors for Cummins diesel engines.
Cummins Distribution Business[edit]
Cummins Distribution Business consists of Engine and Power Generation Distribution as well as Service and Parts. The distribution unit of Cummins consists of 17 Cummins owned distributors and 10 joint ventures, covering 90 countries and territories through 234 locations.
Subsidiaries[edit]




Holset turbocharger (x2), on 450 hp (340 kW) V12 Kromhout diesel engine


Cummins Turbo Technologies[edit]
The Holset Engineering Co. was a British company that produced turbochargers, primarily for diesel and heavy duty application
In 1973 the company was purchased by Cummins after briefly being owned by the Hanson Trust. Holset now operates facilities in China, India, Brazil, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
In 2006, the division officially changed its name to Cummins Turbo Technologies to be identified more closely with its parent company. The turbocharger products still use the Holset brand name.
Cummins Power Systems[edit]
In 1986, Cummins began acquisition of Onan and completed it in 1992. Since then, Onan has evolved into Cummins Power Generation ( now Cummins Power Systems), a wholly invested division of Cummins. The Onan name continues to be used for modern versions of their traditional engine-driven generators for RV, marine, commercial mobility, home standby, and portable use.
Cummins Emission Solutions[edit]
Exhaust and emissions after-treatment company Nelson Industries was purchased in 1999, due to the increasing importance of exhaust after-treatment systems for meeting future emissions standards. The division officially changed its name to Cummins Emission Solutions, in order to be identified more closely with their parent company.
India operations[edit]
Cummins began its India operations on 17 February 1962 in a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group. The ownership structure of the joint venture was divided as follows:

Cummins - 50%
Kirloskar Group - 25.5%
Retail Investors - 24.5%

As of 2013, the Cummins group had revenues of over $1.5 billion, 20 factories and 9000 employees in India.
Cummins does a significant part of its R&D in India at the Cummins Research and Technology centre that was set up in 2003. Also, Cummins is building an advanced technical centre in Pune which will house over 2000 engineers.[12]
Cummins India has also made significant contributions to local skill development by establishing the MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women, a women-only engineering college in Pune.[13]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
