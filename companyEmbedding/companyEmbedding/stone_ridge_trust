Microsoft Dynamics CRM
Customer relationship management (CRM) is the electronic visibility and maintenance of relationships, and the tracking of information, sales, and communications – all in one place. Microsoft Dynamics CRM provides a channel for categorization, organization and company-wide accessibility to data at your fingertips across all devices.
Key Components:

Leads: creation, tracking, and management through entire sales cycle
Accounts/Contacts: relationships, participation in activities and hierarchy
Opportunities/Products: creation, tracking, visibility, and monitoring
Activities: calls, emails, appointments, tasks and surveys
Cases: service Management, tracking, and visibility
Workflow: automation of process and handoff of activity responsibility

Dynamics CRM tools centralize customer information, automate marketing interactions, provide business intelligence, and facilitate communications for increased productivity. Dynamics CRM tracks sales opportunities, analyzes data and allows you access to the information you need to deliver the best results for your customers.

Software Assurance Transition Benefits for Microsoft Dynamics
Stoneridge Software often works with clients currently using other Microsoft Dynamics solutions like Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL. Over time, your business has changed and you might have determined that your current system no longer meets your needs, but you don’t want to lose the investment you made in the software licenses. You don’t have to. Microsoft offers Software Assurance Transition Benefits. By transitioning from your current Microsoft Dynamics product to another Microsoft Dynamics ERP solution, customers are able to “cash-in” their investment in Dynamics, and use that value towards Microsoft Dynamics 365 or Microsoft Dynamics NAV.
We will work closely with you and Microsoft to determine the value of your current Dynamics license and apply that towards the license cost of your new Microsoft Dynamics ERP solution. Just as we do with clients that are new to Dynamics, we go through the same discovery and demonstration process to ensure that switching to a new Dynamics solution will meet your unique requirements.
