University of California - Hastings College of Law

It is the oldest law school on the West Coast. It is also one of the few university-affiliated law schools in the United States that does not share its campus with undergraduates or other graduate programs.

Timeline of discoveries and contributions by UC Berkeley scholars.

Traditions of Cal: Who was the Angel of Death? What's with the "Big C" up there in the hills — and why is it sometimes green? Who wears Oski's jolly bear head and size 54 yellow sweater?
