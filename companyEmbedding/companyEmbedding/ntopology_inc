In topology and related areas of mathematics, a product space is the cartesian product of a family of topological spaces equipped with a natural topology called the product topology. This topology differs from another, perhaps more obvious, topology called the box topology, which can also be given to a product space and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only finitely many spaces. However, the product topology is "correct" in that it makes the product space a categorical product of its factors, whereas the box topology is too fine; this is the sense in which the product topology is "natural".

Definition[edit]
Given X such that





X
:=

∏

i
∈
I



X

i




{\displaystyle X:=\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}}



is the Cartesian product of the topological spaces Xi, indexed by 



i
∈
I


{\displaystyle i\in I}

, and the canonical projections pi : X → Xi, the product topology on X is defined to be the coarsest topology (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections pi are continuous. The product topology is sometimes called the Tychonoff topology.
The open sets in the product topology are unions (finite or infinite) of sets of the form 




∏

i
∈
I



U

i




{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}U_{i}}

, where each Ui is open in Xi and Ui ≠ Xi for only finitely many i. In particular, for a finite product (in particular, for the product of two topological spaces), the products of base elements of the Xi gives a basis for the product 




∏

i
∈
I



X

i




{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}}

.
The product topology on X is the topology generated by sets of the form pi−1(Ui), where i is in I and Ui is an open subset of Xi. In other words, the sets {pi−1(Ui)} form a subbase for the topology on X. A subset of X is open if and only if it is a (possibly infinite) union of intersections of finitely many sets of the form pi−1(Ui). The pi−1(Ui) are sometimes called open cylinders, and their intersections are cylinder sets.
In general, the product of the topologies of each Xi forms a basis for what is called the box topology on X. In general, the box topology is finer than the product topology, but for finite products they coincide.
Examples[edit]
If one starts with the standard topology on the real line R and defines a topology on the product of n copies of R in this fashion, one obtains the ordinary Euclidean topology on Rn.
The Cantor set is homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the discrete space {0,1} and the space of irrational numbers is homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the natural numbers, where again each copy carries the discrete topology.
Several additional examples are given in the article on the initial topology.
Properties[edit]
The product space X, together with the canonical projections, can be characterized by the following universal property: If Y is a topological space, and for every i in I, fi : Y → Xi is a continuous map, then there exists precisely one continuous map f : Y → X such that for each i in I the following diagram commutes:



This shows that the product space is a product in the category of topological spaces. It follows from the above universal property that a map f : Y → X is continuous if and only if fi = pi o f is continuous for all i in I. In many cases it is easier to check that the component functions fi are continuous. Checking whether a map f : Y → X is continuous is usually more difficult; one tries to use the fact that the pi are continuous in some way.
In addition to being continuous, the canonical projections pi : X → Xi are open maps. This means that any open subset of the product space remains open when projected down to the Xi. The converse is not true: if W is a subspace of the product space whose projections down to all the Xi are open, then W need not be open in X. (Consider for instance W = R2 \ (0,1)2.) The canonical projections are not generally closed maps (consider for example the closed set 



{
(
x
,
y
)
∈


R


2


∣
x
y
=
1
}
,


{\displaystyle \{(x,y)\in \mathbb {R} ^{2}\mid xy=1\},}

 whose projections onto both axes are R \ {0}).
The product topology is also called the topology of pointwise convergence because of the following fact: a sequence (or net) in X converges if and only if all its projections to the spaces Xi converge. In particular, if one considers the space X = RI of all real valued functions on I, convergence in the product topology is the same as pointwise convergence of functions.
Any product of closed subsets of Xi is a closed set in X.
An important theorem about the product topology is Tychonoff's theorem: any product of compact spaces is compact. This is easy to show for finite products, while the general statement is equivalent to the axiom of choice.
Relation to other topological notions[edit]

Separation

Every product of T0 spaces is T0
Every product of T1 spaces is T1
Every product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff[1]
Every product of regular spaces is regular
Every product of Tychonoff spaces is Tychonoff
A product of normal spaces need not be normal


Compactness

Every product of compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem)
A product of locally compact spaces need not be locally compact. However, an arbitrary product of locally compact spaces where all but finitely many are compact is locally compact (This condition is sufficient and necessary).


Connectedness

Every product of connected (resp. path-connected) spaces is connected (resp. path-connected)
Every product of hereditarily disconnected spaces is hereditarily disconnected.


Metric spaces

Countable products of metric spaces are metrizable



Axiom of choice[edit]
The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that the product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. The proof is easy enough: one needs only to pick an element from each set to find a representative in the product. Conversely, a representative of the product is a set which contains exactly one element from each component.
The axiom of choice occurs again in the study of (topological) product spaces; for example, Tychonoff's theorem on compact sets is a more complex and subtle example of a statement that is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

FAQ — nTopology




























































FAQ Element crashes right when I boot it up. What's up with that?The most common cause of instability with Element is, oddly enough, out of date video card drivers. If you're experiencing any issues getting Element to run successfully, the first thing to do is make sure your drivers are up to date. If you're using NVIDIA, you can do that here. For AMD, go here. In addition, if you're using a laptop then you should make sure that Element is set to use your dedicated graphics card - which you can do by following this (rather cheesy) video tutorial. When I Generate a new lattice, nothing shows up.This is also caused by out of date video card drivers - see above! How do I export the lattice that I made?For Pro users, we offer lattice export in Parasolid and Graph (LTCX) format. For Element Free users, lattices can be exported as STL, OBJ, and other mesh file formats. To export a mesh file, open the `Mesh` tool, select a thickened lattice, and click `Generate.` Then use the `Export Mesh` button to save the file to disk. Do you have a version of Element for Mac?We don't currently support Element on Mac, and don't have specific plans to release a Mac OS version. In addition, Element will *not* work via Parallels or VMWare Fusion, as those systems don't have access to physical video cards. Element does work well via Boot Camp, though!

Product topology

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

"Product space" redirects here. For other uses, see The Product Space.
In topology and related areas of mathematics, a product space is the cartesian product of a family of topological spaces equipped with a natural topology called the product topology. This topology differs from another, perhaps more obvious, topology called the box topology, which can also be given to a product space and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only finitely many spaces. However, the product topology is "correct" in that it makes the product space a categorical product of its factors, whereas the box topology is too fine; this is the sense in which the product topology is "natural".

Definition[edit]
Given X such that





X
:=

∏

i
∈
I



X

i




{\displaystyle X:=\prod _{i\in I}X_{i}}



is the Cartesian product of the topological spaces Xi, indexed by 



i
∈
I


{\displaystyle i\in I}

, and the canonical projections pi : X → Xi, the product topology on X is defined to be the coarsest topology (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections pi are continuous. The product topology is sometimes called the Tychonoff topology.
The open sets in the product topology are unions (finite or infinite) of sets of the form 




∏

i
∈
I



U

i




{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}U_{i}}

, where each Ui is open in Xi and Ui ≠ Xi for only finitely many i. In particular, for a finite product (in particular, for the product of two topological spaces), the products of base elements of the Xi gives a basis for the product 




∏

i
∈
I



X

i




{\displaystyle \prod _{i\in I}X_{i}}

.
The product topology on X is the topology generated by sets of the form pi−1(Ui), where i is in I and Ui is an open subset of Xi. In other words, the sets {pi−1(Ui)} form a subbase for the topology on X. A subset of X is open if and only if it is a (possibly infinite) union of intersections of finitely many sets of the form pi−1(Ui). The pi−1(Ui) are sometimes called open cylinders, and their intersections are cylinder sets.
In general, the product of the topologies of each Xi forms a basis for what is called the box topology on X. In general, the box topology is finer than the product topology, but for finite products they coincide.
Examples[edit]
If one starts with the standard topology on the real line R and defines a topology on the product of n copies of R in this fashion, one obtains the ordinary Euclidean topology on Rn.
The Cantor set is homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the discrete space {0,1} and the space of irrational numbers is homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the natural numbers, where again each copy carries the discrete topology.
Several additional examples are given in the article on the initial topology.
Properties[edit]
The product space X, together with the canonical projections, can be characterized by the following universal property: If Y is a topological space, and for every i in I, fi : Y → Xi is a continuous map, then there exists precisely one continuous map f : Y → X such that for each i in I the following diagram commutes:



This shows that the product space is a product in the category of topological spaces. It follows from the above universal property that a map f : Y → X is continuous if and only if fi = pi o f is continuous for all i in I. In many cases it is easier to check that the component functions fi are continuous. Checking whether a map f : Y → X is continuous is usually more difficult; one tries to use the fact that the pi are continuous in some way.
In addition to being continuous, the canonical projections pi : X → Xi are open maps. This means that any open subset of the product space remains open when projected down to the Xi. The converse is not true: if W is a subspace of the product space whose projections down to all the Xi are open, then W need not be open in X. (Consider for instance W = R2 \ (0,1)2.) The canonical projections are not generally closed maps (consider for example the closed set 



{
(
x
,
y
)
∈


R


2


∣
x
y
=
1
}
,


{\displaystyle \{(x,y)\in \mathbb {R} ^{2}\mid xy=1\},}

 whose projections onto both axes are R \ {0}).
The product topology is also called the topology of pointwise convergence because of the following fact: a sequence (or net) in X converges if and only if all its projections to the spaces Xi converge. In particular, if one considers the space X = RI of all real valued functions on I, convergence in the product topology is the same as pointwise convergence of functions.
Any product of closed subsets of Xi is a closed set in X.
An important theorem about the product topology is Tychonoff's theorem: any product of compact spaces is compact. This is easy to show for finite products, while the general statement is equivalent to the axiom of choice.
Relation to other topological notions[edit]

Separation

Every product of T0 spaces is T0
Every product of T1 spaces is T1
Every product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff[1]
Every product of regular spaces is regular
Every product of Tychonoff spaces is Tychonoff
A product of normal spaces need not be normal


Compactness

Every product of compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem)
A product of locally compact spaces need not be locally compact. However, an arbitrary product of locally compact spaces where all but finitely many are compact is locally compact (This condition is sufficient and necessary).


Connectedness

Every product of connected (resp. path-connected) spaces is connected (resp. path-connected)
Every product of hereditarily disconnected spaces is hereditarily disconnected.


Metric spaces

Countable products of metric spaces are metrizable



Axiom of choice[edit]
The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that the product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. The proof is easy enough: one needs only to pick an element from each set to find a representative in the product. Conversely, a representative of the product is a set which contains exactly one element from each component.
The axiom of choice occurs again in the study of (topological) product spaces; for example, Tychonoff's theorem on compact sets is a more complex and subtle example of a statement that is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

Glossary — nTopology




























































Glossary 
Lattice
A lattice is an interlaced structure of nodes and beams. It is used for its high strength to weight ratio.LTCXLTCX is Element's lattice file format (Lattice Graph Interchange Module). Our Lattice Graph interchange module allows lattices to be imported and exported in a lightweight, open source, XML based file format. This allows you to analyze even the most complex structures using your existing FEA toolset - without having to deal with slow, heavy 3D meshes.NodeA node is a beam connection point.Open BeamAn open beam is a beam that doesn't connect to another beam on at least one end.
Rule
A rule is the type of cell that is patterned to construct a lattice. It is comprised of a single unit and it's tessellation
Surface Lattice
A surface lattice is a lattice that is generated on the surface of an object.
Topology

Topology is a pretty complex concept, but generally, it's the arrangement and orientation of holes in a part. When it comes to our program, 'Generate' tools execute topology operations and 'Thickening' tools execute shape operations. 
Valence
Valence is the number of beams connected to a single node.

EXCLUSIVE with nTopology, Inc. — Making Lattice Design an Integrated and Seamless Part of the Design Process

Posted on June 23, 2016  by  david 


 
nTopology, Inc., based in New York, New York, USA, recently released a topology optimization software program called Element Free that provides engineers and designers with the ability to create complex structures using lattice design tools. Currently, Element Free is a free, Windows download application. The company has further plans to release a second software program, Element Pro, this summer.
nTopology Inc. at AM3D
Charlotte, North Carolina, USA
21-24 August, 2016
We caught up with Spencer Wright, Head of Product for nTopology Inc., to learn about topology optimization and nTopology Inc. in an exclusive AMazing® Q&A conversation.
*******
AMazing®: Spencer, thank you for your participation. How would you define topology optimization?
Spencer Wright: Topology optimization looks at a part and tries to move material around (and hopefully remove it too) so that it’s as efficient as possible. Traditional topology optimization usually takes a design space (literally a 3D volume) and some loading conditions as inputs, and tries to either minimize mass or maximize stiffness on the output. But that’s just one approach to topology optimization: there are other ways to think of the design space, and other outputs that you can optimize for, and many strategies that you can take to get from one to the other.

In general I find conventional topology optimization to be a bit short sighted, and prefer to guide the design process through a specific design approach (usually including variable lattice structures). I also find the mass/stiffness criteria extremely limiting as a product manager, and prefer optimization software that takes printability and manufacturing process chain into account as well.
AMazing®: As stated on the company website, nTopology Inc. was founded with the goal to help engineers make better, 3D printed parts. What was the motivation for creating design software specifically for additive manufacturing?
Spencer Wright: Additive offers the chance to rethink the design process, and it has brought a new influx of talent and interest to engineering and manufacturing. As a product manager myself, I know that other manufacturing processes (moulding, milling, grinding, EDM, etc.) are key in bringing products to market. But as a CAD company, there’s a real opportunity to using design for AM as a testing ground for changes that we think the overall engineering industry might benefit from.
AMazing®: nTopology recently released a free, Windows download application called “Element Free” that will provide engineers and designers with the ability to create complex, interlaced lattice structures. Tell us about Element Free. What makes Element Free easier, more intuitive and more accessible to a growing market of designers and engineers interested in topology optimization?
Spencer Wright: Until additive manufacturing, there was never a need for CAD software to support 3D lattice design. Element Free brings together the core elements of the lattice design work that nTopology has been doing for years, and gives you a powerful set of tools to create highly variable structures quickly. Lattice design is all that it does, and it does that really well. In that respect it’s like any single-purpose tool, and you can think of traditional 3D CAD software like a Swiss Army knife.
Everyone knows that the corkscrew in your kitchen is way better at opening a bottle of wine than a Swiss Army knife is, and Element Free is way better at designing lattices than traditional CAD software. It’s just that nobody ever thought to devote energy to lattice design before, because additive manufacturing only just made it possible to manufacture lattices in the first place.
Image courtesy of nTopology Inc.
AMazing®: nTopology has plans to release a professional version called “Element Pro” this summer. What can you tell us about Element Pro? How is Element Pro ideally suited for additive manufacturing?
Spencer Wright: Let me start with this: I honestly believe that Element Free is the most powerful lattice design software on the market – paid or free. But if you want to do mechanical analysis, or optimize the orientation of your lattice for performance and/or printability, or really exploit the variable mechanical properties that lattices offer, then you’ll need a little more. We learned this in 2015, when we developed Element Beta and built a whole suite of bespoke tools to do things like simulation, morphing, warping, subdivision, and custom lattice rule building.
Image courtesy of nTopology Inc.
We’re now in the process of porting those (and a few new features) over as Pro modules that will live on top of Element Free. The first of these (out in late June) is a data exchange format that allows you to import and export lattices from Element to your favorite FEA and build processing software, and we’ll have a few additional modules coming out later in the summer.
AMazing®: Recently, Airbus and Autodesk showcased an A320 bionic partition (separates the passenger cabin from the galley) that replicated cellular structure and bone growth found in living organisms. Do you envision the use of lattice structure, optimized for additive manufacturing, will become commonplace in the next generation of additive manufacturing parts?
Spencer Wright: First, let me say that I think that The Living (Autodesk) did a really great job on that project. Their approach treated the structure at multiple levels (macrostructure; printed component; lattice), which is really necessary on any serious project.
As far as the future of lattices goes: There are a lot of applications where they will no doubt be useful – and many (especially in the medical implants field) that are already in production. There are certainly obstacles for many of these – surface finish is a big factor, as is the need for a new paradigm for documentation and inspection of highly complex parts. But the benefits are there – both in terms of improved performance and the reduced dimensionality of the design process.
Lattices make it extremely easy to design variable structures, and with nTopology Element we make lattice design an integrated and seamless part of your existing design process.
Image courtesy of nTopology Inc.
AMazing®: As we understand, you will be a presenter at this year’s ASME Additive Manufacturing + 3D Printing Conference (AM3D). What topics do you plan on presenting at AM3D? 
Spencer Wright: I’ll be talking (unsurprisingly   ) about lattice design! In particular, I’m very interested in how lattices – with all their complexity – actually help reduce the complexity of the design process. Looking forward to it!
This concludes our interview. Spencer, thank you very much for your participation. We are very grateful for the opportunity to learn about nTopology products and services and upcoming presentation at AM3D.

Stand: 44
Standard

nTopology makes 3D design software that exploits the benefits of industrial additive manufacturing. Our first product, Element, allows for highly complex lattice structures to be designed, simulated, and tuned for demanding applications.
Background
Conventional CAD tools (SolidWorks, Siemens NX, OnShape, etc.; in total, a $19B industry growing at about 12%) are designed for conventional manufacturing (casting, machining, forging, stamping, etc.). The limitations of those processes are built into the design software itself. Additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing) allows for material to be arranged in ways that were never possible before. It is possible to use conventional CAD to design parts that will be 3D printed, but in general the process will be long, difficult, and produce suboptimal
results.
As additive manufacturing matures (the industry is about $5B now and growing at about 25% CAGR), there is a pressing need for CAD tools that are designed specifically for it.
Our Solution
nTopology’s first product, Element, is a 3D design suite made specifically for additive manufacturing. Element provides the feedback engineers need to account for the design limitations and opportunities of additive manufacturing. With Element, parts that before would take weeks to design can be imagined and sent to manufacturing in a matter of hours.
Strategy
In 2015, we ran a beta program to test features on a range of tools for 3D lattice design. In April of 2016, we released a stripped down free version of our lattice design software. In the coming months, we’ll release a series of paid modules that will sell on an annual subscription basis.
Team
With hands-on backgrounds in manufacturing management, design for additive, and industrial UX, the nTopology team has a combined 25 years of experience working in the additive manufacturing engineering workflow.
