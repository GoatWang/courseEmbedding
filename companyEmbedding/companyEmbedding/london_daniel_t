CONNECT WITH ME


































































Dan London is group chief executive of the Health & Public Service operating group, responsible for Accenture's services globally to healthcare providers and health plans, as well as services to government and public sector clients in the defense, revenue, human services, public health, postal, justice and public safety sectors. He is also a member of Accenture’s Global Management Committee.
Before assuming his current role in June 2014, Mr. London was senior managing director of Health & Public Service in North America, with broad responsibility for the operating unit’s strategy and growth initiatives, client relationships and financial performance.
Between 2006 and 2009, Mr. London was managing director of Accenture’s Finance & Performance Management global service line.  In that role, he worked with clients on major finance transformation programs involving strategic planning, business architecture, enterprise resource management, finance operations and reporting, shared services, and outsourcing, and also was responsible for building the group’s capabilities through new service offerings and alliance relationships.
Previously, Mr. London held a variety of other leadership roles in Finance & Performance Management. Earlier in his career, he managed Accenture’s business relationships with major clients, in both the Resources and Products operating groups, focused on large-scale ERP and shared services transformations. Mr. London has also played an important role in Accenture’s strategic planning efforts and company-wide operating model changes.
Mr. London joined Accenture in 1986 and became a partner in 1998. He earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science from Rutgers University.

What Does The Future Hold For NHTSA?
				 By  Daniel T. Campbell on March 29, 2017 Posted in Advertising & Product Risk Management, Events


More than two months after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the automotive industry continues to face substantial uncertainty regarding the direction and priorities of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) over the next few years. For now, we can only guess.  The new Transportation Secretary, Elaine Chao, was confirmed January 31.  She takes over a NHTSA that had been working hard to keep up with emerging technologies – while acting increasingly muscular in its fines and other punishments under the prior administration.
For some safety agencies, it is much easier to read the tea leaves under the new administration. For example, at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, for example, we know that there is a new Republican Acting Chair (Ann Marie Buerkle), and that the five commissioners will remain 3-2 in favor of Democrats until at least October 2017 when Democratic Commissioner Marietta Robinson’s term on the Commission expires.  See prior article here.  And, following Acting Chair Buerkle’s public remarks last month at the annual conference of the International Consumer Product Health and Safety Organization (ICPHSO), we know that her top three priorities include: (1) collaborating with all product safety stakeholders; (2) taking a balanced and reasonable approach to regulation; and (3) expanding product safety education and awareness for consumers.  See prior article here.

In contrast, at NHTSA, the top half of the organization chart is largely empty. Important positions like the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, and Chief Counsel remain “vacant.”  While Executive Director Jack Danielson now serves as the Acting Deputy Administrator, these top positions need to be filled, which we predict is likely to occur  after the Supreme Court confirmation process and most likely the tax reform issue.  Those positions would still need  to be vetted and confirmed.
In the meantime, this creates substantial uncertainty for automobile manufacturers and equipment manufacturers that are regulated by NHTSA.   Pursuant to NHTSA’s regulations, certain decisions and authority are specifically proscribed for some of these vacant positions.  From a practical perspective, many important agency decisions are likely to be delayed until these positions are filled.  For example, when a company is required to provide to NHTSA documents or materials that it wants to keep confidential, such as sensitive business information, at the agency level a determination of confidentiality ultimately rests with the Chief Counsel.  It is unclear in the current state of things how a situation would play out involving a significant or controversial confidentiality request.
Once the vacant positions are filled, it is unclear how NHTSA will approach important issues or what will become of NHTSA’s priorities.   For example, how will the agency under the new Administration address autonomous technology issues and development?  In a  few public comments, Secretary Chao  has supported the technology and urged industry to step up and educate the public about it, while also stating that the new administration is “reevaluating” the guidance that NHTSA issued last September.  However, many important questions remain.
Similar questions and unknowns swirl around other recent NHTSA priorities, such as enforcement and penalties, fuel economy, and safe driving programs. As with the CPSC, we can expect the Agency to continue pushing safety in those areas where safety has been pushed before.  On the other hand, in the areas of new and emerging technologies, testing methods, and data, or where states’ rights may intertwine (or not) with industry interest, the future remains to be seen.
For more discussion about these issues coming out of the Trump administration, please join us tomorrow March 30, 2017 at 1:00 for our webinar, The Safety Agencies in Transition – What to Expect at FDA, CPSC and NHTSA in the First 100 Days, part of our Crowell & Moring The First 100 Days webinar series.

Dan Campbell is a partner in the Mass Tort, Product, and Consumer Litigation Group based in Crowell & Moring's Washington, D.C. office. He is also a member of the Steering Committee for the firm's Advertising & Product Risk Management Group. 
Dan primarily represents corporations and organizations faced with product liability and related commercial or contractual disputes throughout the United States. In this capacity, Dan serves as national coordinating counsel, strategic counsel, and trial counsel for companies of all sizes on product liability, warranty, and other personal injury and property damage matters. Dan's tort and product liability clients span the automotive, railroad, and aviation industries, and include consumer product manufacturers and retailers. Dan also handles complex contract, commercial litigation and arbitration matters for product manufacturers, service providers, and government contractor companies.
Dan's automotive industry practice includes the representation of both manufacturers and suppliers in product defect, warranty, and contract claims, as well as counseling on regulatory issues involving NHTSA and other government agencies. Dan's recent automotive work includes:

Representing one of the world's leading Tier 1 parts suppliers in a billion dollar dispute over alleged product defect and warranty claims, in which Dan helped guide the client to a favorable resolution of the dispute prior to litigation. 
Counseling clients on approach and response to NHTSA recall issues. 
Representing an international parts supplier in defense of a federal court products liability suit involving claims of severe personal injuries. 

Dan is ready to take a case through trial, if warranted, and has the experience to do so. He has first chaired over 30 jury trials through verdict in state and federal courts in his career and has argued cases to the Virginia Supreme Court. Some of Dan's recent defense verdicts include: 

Defending a national wheelchair distributor in a federal court trial involving claims of product defect resulting in severe brain injuries. 
Defending one of the nation's leading amusement park owners in a federal court trial involving claims of ride design defect resulting in severe permanent injuries. 
Defending a surgeon in a state court trial involving claims of medical malpractice resulting in severe personal injuries. 

Of course, for risk management, commercial relations, and cost reasons not all cases should go to trial. Dan has handled cases that resulted in summary judgment, dismissal or other favorable resolution for his clients, including recent examples such as: 

Representing one of the nation's leading transportation companies, providing rail-based transportation services, regarding complex contract and tort issues related to a significant bridge collapse and train derailment. 
Representing one of the nation's leading transportation companies, providing rail-based transportation services, in defense of alleged groundwater contamination property damage claims. 
Representing one of the nation's leading amusement park owners in defense of various premises liability claims involving alleged severe personal injuries, resulting in summary judgments or other dismissals for the client. 

In his APRM practice, Dan counsels consumer product and automotive manufacturers and suppliers in pre-litigation strategies and other issues, such as product risk assessment, design and testing strategy, and warning language. 
In the area of aviation litigation, Dan has represented a national airline in state and federal tort litigation, as well as one of the nation's largest chains of aviation fixed-base operations. 
Dan is the chair of the firm’s Lawyer Development Committee. Also, Dan has served as an instructor for Crowell & Moring's Trial Advocacy program since its inception. In this program, Crowell & Moring associates and counsel receive bi-weekly training and instruction on various trial elements and skills. The program culminates each June in mock trials held in the D.C. federal courthouse. 
Dan is a former member of a firm in Norfolk, Virginia, where he represented Fortune 500 companies and smaller organizations in defense of product liability, premises liability, toxic tort, and railroad FELA claims, as well as on commercial litigation matters. Dan also represented physicians and other health care providers in defense of medical malpractice claims, and nursing home facilities in defense of negligence claims. 
For several years Dan was the statewide coordinator and chair of the Virginia Bar Association Young Lawyers' Division Model Judiciary Program, which provides an opportunity for high school students to participate in mock trials and mock appeals before real judges, including appellate arguments to the Justices of the Supreme Court of Virginia. Dan also served on the Executive Committee of the VBA YLD.
Dan received his A.B. from the College of William & Mary and his J.D. from Washington and Lee University School of Law. Dan is admitted to practice in the District of Columbia and in Virginia, as well as before federal district courts in the Eastern and Western Districts of Virginia, the Federal Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Dan is a member of the American Bar Association, the Defense Research Institute, and the Virginia Association of Defense Attorneys, and is the past chair of the Norfolk Portsmouth Bar Association Young Lawyers Section.
