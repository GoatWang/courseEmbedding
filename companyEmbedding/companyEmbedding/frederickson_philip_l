Philip L. Frederickson
Distinguished Engineer
2004
Degree
Industrial Engineering – 1978 
Citation
At Time of Nomination in 2004
Philip L. Frederickson is originally from Borger, Texas. He received his Bachelor of Science in Industrial 
				Engineering from Texas Tech University in 1978.
Upon graduation, Mr. Frederickson joined the Conoco engineering training program and served in a series of 
				assignments supporting the company’s U.S. transportation operations and its natural gas business. Within the next 
				10 years, he would have 14 jobs and move 9 times.
In 1989, Mr. Frederickson was named General Manager of the company’s European refining and marketing 
				operations, followed by a move to Dublin to serve as President and Managing Director of Conoco Ireland. Under his 
				management, a successful turnaround plan was implemented that improved Conoco Ireland from a struggling business to a 
				strong performer. In 1994, he returned to the United States to assume responsibility for the refining, marketing and 
				transportation business in the Rocky Mountain region. He formed a cohesive cross–functional management team, 
				implemented a growth strategy, and significantly increased the unit’s profitability. While in Colorado, he served 
				on the Board of Directors for Colorado Special Olympics and as chairman of its Development Committee.
In 2001, Mr. Frederickson was named Senior Vice President of corporate strategy and business development. After the 
				merger of Conoco and Phillips Petroleum, Mr. Frederickson played a major role in the transition planning team that was 
				responsible for the integration of the two companies and for capturing value from the creation of the new, major, 
				international energy company. 
Currently, Mr. Frederickson is Executive Vice President, Commercial for ConocoPhillips and a member of the management 
				committee. In this capacity, he has global responsibility for all commodity transactions for the company including crude 
				oil, gasoline, distillates, natural gas liquids, natural gas and power. Mr. Frederickson manages a work force with 
				offices around the world and is responsible for annual sales of more than 250 million barrels of crude oil produced by 
				ConocoPhillips, supply of almost 1 billion barrels per year of crude oil to the company’s 18 refineries, purchase 
				or sales of more than a billion barrels of petroleum products, and the marketing of 3.5 trillion cubic feet per year of 
				natural gas. 
Mr. Frederickson is a member of the American Institute of Industrial Engineers and the Academy of Industrial 
				Engineers of Texas Tech University. He serves on the Board of Directors for Theatre Under The Stars and Duke Energy 
				Field Services, and was recently named a member of the 25 Year Club of the Petroleum Industry.
He and his wife, Jayne, have two children, Michelle and Scott.
Texas Tech University is honored and proud to name Philip L. Frederickson as DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER.
