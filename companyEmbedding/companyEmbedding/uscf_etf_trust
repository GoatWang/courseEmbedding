Fund Details
USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund is an exchange traded fund (ETF) designed to capitalize on restaurant companies, one of the fastest growing
industries in the United States1. According to the National Restaurant Association (NRA), restaurant revenues are forecasted to reach $782.7 Billion in
2016, up about 5% year over year. In an industry that employs over 14.4 million people and serves about 50 million people each day (numbers which
are expected to increase), it is easy to understand how the restaurant industry represents approximately 4% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Smart Beta Methodology – Uses a four-step selection process that includes two quantitative screens and two dynamic screens. The Restaurant
Leaders INDXX Index is rebalanced quarterly.
Definable Investment Solution – May meet the needs for growth investors, sector rotation strategists, and professionals seeking exposure to the restaurant industry.
Transparent and liquid – Holdings are posted each day on the fund’s website. The ETF structure allows investors to trade throughout the day, and use limit, stop, and stop-limit orders.
Investment Objective
The USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund (NYSE: MENU) seeks to track the price and yield performance
of the Restaurant Leaders INDXX Index (iMENU), before fees and expenses.
The USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund allows investors to access a portfolio of companies in the
restaurant industry, in an easy-to-trade ETF. The Index invests in business franchises that are
leverageable, scalable with high return on capital and which touch millions of people every day.
About the Restaurant Leaders INDXX Index
The Index is composed of the common stock of U.S. and international restaurant companies. By using a proprietary Smart Beta four step selection process, the index seeks to identify Restaurant Companies that are outperforming or expected to outperform their industry peers. The Index may include small-, mid-, and large-capitalization companies that trade on a U.S. Exchange and have both a minimum market capitalization of $300 million and an average daily trading volume of $1.5 million. The Index is generally expected to include between 30 and 40 Restaurant Companies and will be rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly in March, June, September, and December. At the time the Index is rebalanced, an initial target weight of 70% is equally distributed among all securities classified as Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs), and an initial target weight of 30% is equally distributed among all securities classified as Full Service Restaurants (FSRs). Given the number of eligible securities, it may not be possible to achieve these target weights in either category, in which case there would not be an exact 70%/30% initially targeted split as described above. Additionally, the Index uses market signals to eliminate some of the securities with the lowest expected future performance and increase the weighting of the largest companies in the Index.  This process could also cause the Index to vary from the 70%/30% initially targeted split between QSRs and FSRs.

*USCF Advisers LLC (the "Adviser") has contractually agreed to waive or reduce its fees and to reimburse the Fund for its expenses from inception until October 31, 2017, so that the total annual fund operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, expenses related to short sales, other expenses that are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, extraordinary expenses, if any, and payments, if any, under the Fund’s Rule 12b-1 plan) of the Fund are limited to 0.65% of average daily net assets. Prior to such date, the expense limitation may be terminated only by a vote of the Fund's board of trustees (the "Board"). After such date, the expense limitation may be renewed, terminated or revised by the Adviser, but the Adviser must provide the Board with 90 days' notice of any termination. The Adviser is permitted to recoup from the Fund previously waived advisory fees or reimbursed expenses for three years from the date on which fees were waived or expenses reimbursed, as long as such recoupment does not cause the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses to exceed the expense cap that was applicable during the period in which the fees were waived or expenses were reimbursed.



Historical NAV








The performance data quoted above represents past performance. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Investment return and value of the Fund shares will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.


Performance








< Swipe table for more info >
Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.
The Adviser has agreed to waive or reduce its fees and to reimburse the Fund for its expenses from inception through October 31, 2017, limiting total annual operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, expenses related to short sales, and other expenses) to 0.65% of the Fund’s average daily net assets. 
The Fund's NAV is calculated by dividing the value of the Fund's total assets less total liabilities by the number of shares outstanding. Share price returns are based on closing prices for the Fund and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.
Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

The performance data quoted above represents past performance. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

The performance data quoted above represents past performance. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Investment return and value of the Fund shares will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

The above frequency distribution chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's reported net asset value. The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

Value
 Is USCF ETF Trust - Stock Split Index Fund undervalued based on future cash flows and its price relative to the stock market?

Value is all about what a company is worth versus what price it is available for. If you went into a grocery store and all the bananas were on sale at half price, they could be considered undervalued.



INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS 

 It is not possible to calculate the future cash flow value for USCF ETF Trust - Stock Split Index Fund. This is due to cash flow or dividend data being unavailable. The share price is $17.43.



PRICE RELATIVE TO MARKET 


We can also value a company based on what the stock market is willing to pay for it. This is similar to the price of fruit (e.g. Mangoes or Avacados) increasing when they are out of season, or how much your home is worth.
The amount the stock market is willing to pay for USCF ETF Trust - Stock Split Index Fund's earnings, growth and assets is considered below, and whether this is a fair price.

Discounted cash flow (Dividend Discount Model)
The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for USCF ETF Trust - Stock Split Index Fund is arrived at by discounting future dividends to their present value. This approach is used for finance firms where free cash flow is difficult to estimate (e.g. Banks/ Insurance firms).
If the firm does not pay the majority of its earnings out as a dividend this method will often arrive at a value significantly lower than the share price.
See our documentation to learn about this calculation.

Value of the stock
Value = Expected dividends per share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual growth rate)
$0 = ($0 / (10.55% - 2.33%)
Value per share: $0
Current discount (share price of $17.43): %

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 10.55% = 2.33% + (1.072 * 7.67%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered is used in the case of financial firms, but it is not adjusted for financial leverage like with non-finance firms. Therefore the average levered beta from comparable firms is used as the bottom-up beta. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Average Levered Beta from peers = 1.072
Levered Beta used in calculation = 1.072

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 2.33% is from the 10 year government bond rate in US.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.














Future Performance
 How is USCF ETF Trust - Stock Split Index Fund expected to perform in the next 1 to 3 years based on estimates from 0 analysts?

The future performance of a company is measured in the same way as past performance, by looking at estimated growth and how much profit it is expected to make.Future estimates come from professional analysts. Just like forecasting the weather, they don’t always get it right!

 Insufficient estimate data, unable to calculate 1 year growth expectation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
