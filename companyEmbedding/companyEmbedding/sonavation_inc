Sonavation has entered into a commercial licensing agreement with Analog Devices, Inc. Under the agreement, Sonavation licensed its high performance ultrasonic biometric sensor technology to ADI.


Sonavation Announces Fingerprint Imaging Through Smart Phone OLED Display
Feb 22 16
Sonavation announced breakthrough capability of ultrasound biometric fingerprint imaging through OLED (organic light-emitting diode) displays that are being designed for the next generation of smartphones, tablets, wearables and devices. This technology will allow smart device manufacturers to effectively increase the usable size of their displays by 10%-20% by eliminating the need for a separate inactive area on the device to accommodate a fingerprint sensor. Sonavation’s 3D biometric ultrasound technology will be the only fingerprint authentication solution capable of this level of complex imaging through the full stack display. This ground-breaking technological advancement extends Sonavation’s SonicTouch portfolio and provides manufacturers flexibility in design while delivering the high level of biometric security and a more dynamic user experience.
