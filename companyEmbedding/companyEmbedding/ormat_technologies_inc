State-of-the-Art Technology: The ORMAT® ENERGY CONVERTER (OEC)Ormat’s geothermal power plants and other products are based on the ORMAT® ENERGY CONVERTER (OEC). With over 73 patents, the OEC is a state-of- the-art implementation of Organic Rankine Cycle technology that we have refined and perfected through years of use under the most challenging conditions.
Ormat’s technology involves original designs of turbines, pumps and heat exchangers, as well as the formulation of non-ozone depleting organic motive fluids. We also construct combined cycle geothermal power plants in which the steam first produces power in a backpressure steam turbine and is subsequently condensed in the vaporizer of a bottoming organic vapor turbo generator, which produces additional power. In the conversion of environmentally friendly geothermal energy into electricity, Ormat's technology has several advantages over conventional geothermal steam turbine plants. In addition, Ormat owns or has the right to use our in-house developed products and systems patents; we are also involved in developing new heat extraction technology. 
Empowering the World We Share Founded in 1965, Ormat is committed to developing green, sustainable energy solutions. Through the development of pioneering technology, we are able to re-inject geothermal heat resources back into the earth, preserving reservoirs for future generations. 
Wherever we operate, we are dedicated to working with the community and to supporting local development through job creation, education initiatives, development funds and volunteering. We work hand in hand with schools and institutions of higher learning to promote "Green Energy" education, and lay the ground work for future scientific knowledge.

Technology Leadership
Ormat offers unique renewable power solutions based on the ORMAT® ENERGY CONVERTER (OEC), a power generation unit which converts low, medium and high temperature heat into electrical energy. With 73 patents worldwide, the OEC is a state-of-the-art implementation of Organic Rankine Cycle technology that we have refined and perfected through more than 30 years of use under the most challenging conditions. Ormat’s flexible, modular solutions for Geothermal Power and Recovered Energy generation are all based on the OEC, which is specifically designed for customized power plant options.
Our proprietary technology enables geothermal developers to efficiently and economically use the full range of naturally occurring geothermal resources found throughout the world – from low temperature geothermal water to high-pressure steam. Globally, the OEC is converting energy sources, whether geothermal, gas or heat, into valuable electricity, while setting industry standards for simplicity, reliability and low operating costs.
Ormat Advantages: Designed for outdoor use as well as indoor installation and remote, unattended operation, the OEC combines technological innovation with over 50 million operating turbine hours in the field. 

FlexibilitySpecially designed and tailored plants match resource conditions and optimize the efficiency and cost effectiveness of electrical generation. 

Assures Long Turbine LifespanUnlike its steam turbine counterpart and as a thermodynamic consequence of the hydrocarbons’ ‘drying fluid’ saturation curve, the OEC turbine remains dry under all expected working conditions. This eliminates the possibility of erosion damage to the turbine's buckets and nozzles. Thus, the OEC can accommodate part load operation and large transients more effectively than steam systems.

Operation at Low Temperatures and Anti Freeze ControlThe freezing point of the motive fluid is extremely low. This feature eliminates the requirement to implement controls and procedures to prevent freeze-up within the condenser, heat exchangers and piping. 
Remote, Unattended OperationORC-type power systems have compiled an exemplary reliability record wherever Ormat has applied them. These systems do not require 24/7 manning by a licensed steam plant operator. These two features result in the ability to operate OEC plants in a remote, unattended mode by the same compression station operators. 
High Turbine Efficiency at Low SpeedsDue to the motive fluid’s low sonic velocity, the OEC yields high turbine efficiency at 1500 or 1800 RPM (50 or 60 Hz) without a gearbox, increasing plant output while reducing costs.

Condensing Near Atmospheric PressureThe thermodynamic properties of the motive fluid provide much higher condensing pressures than comparable steam systems. By operating at condensing pressures near atmospheric, the turbine requires shorter blades and the ingress of air into the system is significantly minimized. The latter feature mitigates the need for vacuum maintenance. 
High AvailabilityOrmat binary cycle plants have demonstrated the highest average plant availability in today's market. 
Air and Water CoolingThe OEC can operate with either air or water cooling, depending on the availability and cost of suitable water resources. Air cooling systems feature low operating costs and an exceptionally low environmental profile. They operate in a closed loop, do not require chemical additives and involve no waste disposal. In addition, air cooled plants do not produce a visible plume and blend into the landscape. 
Moisture-free Turbine ExpansionThe OEC turbine remains dry, eliminating the possibility of erosion damage to the turbine's buckets and nozzles. Therefore, the OEC can accommodate part load operation and large transients effectively. 
Synchronous and Asynchronous GeneratorsThe OEC can be configured to produce either synchronous or asynchronous electricity according to local requirements.

High Performance with Minimal Environmental ImpactOrmat's modular power plants are designed to be environmentally friendly. Air-cooled condenser technology enables us to re-inject almost 100% of all extracted geothermal fluids, thereby avoiding the use of geothermal steam condensate or external water resources for cooling and preventing the need for chemical additives. The 100% re-injection also sustains reservoir life and productivity. Due to the low profile of the air-cooled condensers and the lack of any plumes from water cooling towers, both environmental and visual impacts are minimized.

                        About Us
                    


Green Energy You Can Rely On
Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ORA) is a world leader in the geothermal power plant sector. As a geothermal company we have over four decades of experience in the development of state-of-the-art, environmentally sound power solutions, primarily in geothermal and recovered energy generation. In addition to designing, developing, building, owning and operating geothermal energy and recovered energy-based power plants in the United States and other countries, Ormat also designs, manufactures and sells power units and other power generating equipment for geothermal power plants and recovered energy-based electricity generation.Ormat is today's only vertically-integrated provider of geothermal and recovered energy-based equipment, services and power that designs, develops, builds and manufactures most of the equipment used in its plants. The in-depth knowledge gained from these operations gives us a competitive edge by enabling efficient maintenance and timely response to operational issues.State-of-the-Art Technology: The ORMAT® ENERGY CONVERTER (OEC)
Ormat’s geothermal power plants and other products are based on the ORMAT ENERGY CONVERTER (OEC). With over 80 patents world-wide, the OEC is a state-of- the-art implementation of Organic Rankine Cycle technology that we have refined and perfected through years of use under the most challenging conditions.Ormat’s technology involves original designs of turbines, pumps and heat exchangers, as well as the formulation of non-ozone depleting organic motive fluids. We also construct combined cycle geothermal power plants in which the steam first produces power in a backpressure steam turbine and is subsequently condensed in the vaporizer of a bottoming organic vapor turbo generator, which produces additional power. In the conversion of environmentally friendly geothermal energy into electricity, Ormat's technology has several advantages over conventional geothermal steam turbine plants. In addition, Ormat owns or has the right to use our in-house developed products and systems patents; we are also involved in developing new heat extraction technology.Empowering the World We Share
Founded in 1965, Ormat is committed to developing green, sustainable energy solutions. Through the development of pioneering technology, we are able to re-inject geothermal heat resources back into the earth, preserving reservoirs for future generations.Wherever we operate, we are dedicated to working with the community and to supporting local development through job creation, education initiatives, development funds and volunteering. We work hand in hand with schools and institutions of higher learning to promote 'Green Energy' education, and lay the ground work for future scientific knowledge.Ormat's Experienced Team
Ormat was founded and is still managed by pioneers in the geothermal power generation field. Today, Ormat employs over 1000 people worldwide. At cutting-edge research and manufacturing facilities, our engineers research power generation technologies and build and test power plants before deployment. At our geothermal power plants, we train and employ local residents who join the Ormat team.Poised for Growth
Ormat's current portfolio drives profitable operations and financial stability. Through a combination of organic growth and acquisition of geothermal power plants from third parties, Ormat is well positioned for future growth. We plan to continue building a geographically balanced portfolio of geothermal, recovered energy assets and remote power solutions, while maintaining our position as a leading sustainable energy manufacturer, product innovator and service provider.





                        History
                    


Over the past four decades, Ormat has pioneered a number of significant advances in the geothermal energy and recovered energy industries, laying the foundation for the rapid and profitable growth that we are experiencing today. Ormat's engineers have developed highly original designs for turbines and other geothermal power and recovered energy generation equipment components, which have been optimized through the rigorous application of advanced thermodynamics and fluid dynamics.Ormat's unique position of being both an independent power producer, as well as a manufacturer of geothermal energy and recovered energy equipment, provides us with a thorough firsthand understanding of customer needs and the ability to develop creative solutions based on field-tested experience.Today, Ormat has installed approximately 1,370 MW of geothermal and Recovered Energy REG® power plants worldwide, for its own account and for third-party customers. Ormat products and power systems are installed in more than 71 countries. Ormat power solutions are designed for: Geothermal Power Plants Ormat, as a geothermal energy company, is a leader in the development of environmentally benign geothermal power plants that deliver clean, reliable, cost-effective and sustainable electricity. The company’s geothermal power plants produce clean energy with low noise, a low visual profile and nearly 100% fluid injection for minimal impact on the environment.Ormat’s geothermal binary and combined cycle power plants are flexible, adaptable and efficiently matched to the available geothermal resources, which may encompass high enthalpy, high pressure steam fields; low-enthalpy, water-dominated sources; and resources with temperatures and chemistries that vary over time. Recovered Energy REG Power PlantsOrmat specializes in one of the most cost-effective ways to develop additional generating capacity and contribute to a plant's energy efficiency, tapping otherwise unused or under-utilized energy, often with environmental benefits. The company's repowering technologies enable power plants to increase output without any additional fuel expense.
Remote Power Units and Other GeneratorsOrmat designs, manufactures and sells fossil fuel powered turbo-generators with a capacity ranging between 400 watts and 4,000 watts, which operate unattended in remote sites under extreme climate conditions. These units provide power for cathodic protection to avoid oil or gas spillage from pipelines, as well as safety equipment on offshore platforms and along oil and gas pipelines. Customers include contractors installing gas pipelines in remote areas.





                        Governance
                    


Ormat stands behind the principles of honesty, openness, fairness and trust as pillars of our approach to corporate governance. These principles are reflected in the exacting standards that are set out in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, both of which were adopted in 2004 and took effect as our company was formally registered for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Each provides a framework that is aligned with regulatory requirements and reflects 'best practices' principles. Ormat established and maintains adequate internal control over financial reporting and is in compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). The effectiveness of Ormat's internal control has been audited by Price Waterhouse Coopers. Ormat is a publicly traded company managed by a seven-member Board of Directors. Mr. Lucien Bronicki is Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Mrs. Yehudit 'Dita' Bronicki is a Director and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Yoram Bronicki is President and Director and Chief Operating Officer of the company. The other four directors serving on Ormat's board are non-executive and classified as independent. They are: Robert F. Clarke, Roger W. Gale, David Wagener, Dan Falk.





                        Sustainability
                    


The Environmental Benefits of Geothermal and Recovered Energy
Geothermal energy is heat energy that comes from the earth's molten interior deep in the earth's crust. This valuable heat is brought near to the surface due to movements in the earth's crustal plates by intrusion of molten magma and by deep circulation of groundwater. Reservoirs of hot water under pressure are formed. By drilling wells into these reservoirs, steam and high-pressure hot water can be captured and directed to drive turbines in power plants, completing the conversion of this earth-bound energy from heat to electrical energy.Cooled geothermal fluid is injected back to the reservoir where it is reheated and preserves the resource mass balance and sustainability. The advantages of geothermal energy are enormous; it harnesses a natural locally available energy source, it offers base load electricity 24/7 year-round supply with high reliability and provides an environmentally friendly energy alternative which produces no NOx emissions and negligible CO2 emissions.Ormat Power Projects Eligible for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading
In December 2008, the Executive Board of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) officially registered Ormat’s Amatitlan Geothermal Project in Guatemala as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The project is expected to offset emissions of approximately 83,000 tons of CO2 per year. With Amatitlan registered under the CDM, the project will be eligible to receive certified emission reduction credits, each equivalent to one ton of carbon dioxide, which can be traded or sold. The project has a long-term contract to sell all of its emission reduction credits to a European buyer.
Improving Environmental Performance
Ormat's generating portfolio as of the end of 2008 includes a total of 14 geothermal and recovered energy power plants in the United States, Guatemala, Kenya, Nicaragua and New Zealand. While each power plant in our portfolio provides a positive alternative to carbon-intensive electricity generation, our company remains committed to ongoing action to minimize the environmental impact of our operations through reducing, reusing, recycling and applying leading edge technology. In fact, this approach is encapsulated in the Ormat Quality, Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, which guides these initiatives.Connecting with the Community
As a responsible and responsive corporate citizen, Ormat believes it is important to cultivate positive relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders who have an interest in our geothermal and recovered energy power plants. To do so, we employ a variety of activities and communications tools which include websites about our power plants and ongoing projects that affect the local community; a community relations program that encourages employee volunteerism and purchasing from local vendors; participation in local boards such as the Mammoth Lakes Alternative Energy Task Force; the maintenance of an extensive list of stakeholders with whom we stay in touch with via email, phone calls, meetings, and tours of the power plant; and by providing local support to community organizations. These combined efforts ensure that stakeholders are provided with timely and accurate information about our operations and development plans and that they are able to learn more about geothermal energy and how it contributes to the local economy and a cleaner environment.

History[edit]
Ormat was established in 1965 as Ormat Turbines Ltd. (later renamed Ormat Industries), in Yavne, Israel, by engineer Lucien Bronicki (who was the company's chairman and CTO until 2014) and wife Yehudit "Dita" Bronicki (who served as CEO until 2014).[1]
In the late 1950s Lucien Bronicki worked in a government physics laboratory, where he developed a turbine to produce electricity from a range of energy sources, including solar; the process is known as organic Rankine cycle, which he co-developed with Harry Zvi Tabor. He retired from the lab to commercialize his ideas and set up Ormat. In its early years the company focused exclusively on manufacturing power generation equipment.[2]
The 1970s energy crisis increased interest in efficient generation technology. To exploit this situation, Ormat obtained financial assistance from the Israeli government and raised capital from private investors to build one of the world's first solar-driven power stations. However the power station was not economically viable and was abandoned in 1988.[3]
During the 1980s Ormat developed generation systems utilizing recovered energy, i.e. heat emitted during industrial processes. The company also applied its technology to generate electricity from geothermal sources.
In 1986, Ormat designed and supplied geothermal power systems to the Kawerau Power Station in New Zealand. Since then 13 geothermal power plant were built by Ormat in New Zealand.[4]
In 1989, Ormat supplied geothermal equipment for the regional heating system at Sudurnes Iceland; which utilizes the abundant local geothermal resources to provide heating for 20,000 people.[5]
In the 1990s the company decided not only to provide power generation equipment, but also to own and operate alternative and renewable energy power stations.
In 1991, the company, then as Ormat Industries, listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
In 1992, Ormat acquired a controlling stake of Bet Shemesh Engines, a manufactures parts for jet engines, that also overhauls, maintains and assembles jet engines. In 2005, Ormat sold its shares the company.[6]
In 2004, Ormat Technologies, completed an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange raising $100 million. Ormat Technologies was founded in 1994 as a US subsidiary of Ormat Industries. Following the initial public offering, Ormat Industries was restructured as a holding company that was still listed in the exchange, while shifting all its operations to the subsidiary Ormat Technologies.[7]
In 2006, Ormat received for the first time, an order for to supply equipment for a geothermal power plant in Germany.[citation needed]
In February 2015, Ormat Technologies Inc. acquired its parent company, Ormat Industries Ltd., in an all-stock merger. Shareholders of Ormat Technologies retained about 38 percent of the company’s shares, while Ormat Industries Ltd. shareholders owned the remaining 62 percent. Ormat Technologies Inc. shares were listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.[8]
Operations[edit]
The company owns and operates geothermal power plants in California, Nevada, Hawaii, Guatemala and Kenya.
Technologies[edit]




An Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) at a geothermal generation power plant, in Landau, Germany


Thermal Energy[edit]
Ormat’s core technology is the Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) power generation unit. It converts low and medium temperature heat into electrical energy, with low or zero emission of CO2 and pollutants. The OEC's main components are a vaporizer/preheater, turbo-generator, air-cooled or water-cooled condenser, feed pump and controls. Ormat has installed more than 900 MW of geothermal and recovered energy generation (REG) power units, based on OEC technology.[citation needed]
Ormat’s technology is optimized for use in geothermal energy generation, and the company is the third largest geothermal producer in the United States. The technology is also suitable for recovered energy power generation, which converts waste heat from industrial processes into electricity that can be used on site or sold to power generation utilities. Ormat’s recovered energy technology was deployed in projects in Germany, Canada, India, USA and Japan.[citation needed]
Solar Energy[edit]
In the 1980s Ormat built and operated one of the world's first power stations to produce electricity from solar energy, located just north of the Dead Sea in Israel.[3] The plant utilized a technology known as solar pond, a large-scale solar thermal energy collector with integral heat storage for supplying thermal energy. It was the largest operating solar pond ever built for electricity generation and operated up until 1988. It had an area of 210,000 m² and gave an electrical output of 5 MW.[9]
After the decommissioning of the solar pool project Ormat was not active in the solar energy market until recently[when?] when it entered the Solar PV market.
Oil sands[edit]
Ormat's former parent company, Ormat Industries Ltd., developed an energy-efficient technology, OrCrude, for extracting crude oil from oil sands. The OrCrude process is claimed to be more efficient than other technologies as it includes gasification, which substantially reduces the requirement for natural gas, typically the largest input cost in an in-situ oil sands project. The technology is used in the Long Lake project, a former joint venture between Nexen and OPTI Canada.[10] In 2010, Ormat Industries sold all its holdings (5.1%) in OPTI Canada. In 2011, OPTI Canada was acquired by CNOOC Luxembourg S.à r.l, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CNOOC Limited.
Spin offs[edit]
Ormat has been involved in establishment and development of several companies, including:
Orbotech develops and manufactures automated optical inspection (AOI) systems for bare and assembled printed circuit boards and flat panel displays. The company's systems, imaging and computer-aided manufacturing technologies enable electronic manufacturers to achieve the increased yields and throughput essential for electronics production.
Orad Hi-Tec Systems Ltd. develops video and real-time image processing technologies for TV broadcasting, Internet, production studio and sports events.

History[edit]
Ormat was established in 1965 as Ormat Turbines Ltd. (later renamed Ormat Industries), in Yavne, Israel, by engineer Lucien Bronicki (who was the company's chairman and CTO until 2014) and wife Yehudit "Dita" Bronicki (who served as CEO until 2014).[1]
In the late 1950s Lucien Bronicki worked in a government physics laboratory, where he developed a turbine to produce electricity from a range of energy sources, including solar; the process is known as organic Rankine cycle, which he co-developed with Harry Zvi Tabor. He retired from the lab to commercialize his ideas and set up Ormat. In its early years the company focused exclusively on manufacturing power generation equipment.[2]
The 1970s energy crisis increased interest in efficient generation technology. To exploit this situation, Ormat obtained financial assistance from the Israeli government and raised capital from private investors to build one of the world's first solar-driven power stations. However the power station was not economically viable and was abandoned in 1988.[3]
During the 1980s Ormat developed generation systems utilizing recovered energy, i.e. heat emitted during industrial processes. The company also applied its technology to generate electricity from geothermal sources.
In 1986, Ormat designed and supplied geothermal power systems to the Kawerau Power Station in New Zealand. Since then 13 geothermal power plant were built by Ormat in New Zealand.[4]
In 1989, Ormat supplied geothermal equipment for the regional heating system at Sudurnes Iceland; which utilizes the abundant local geothermal resources to provide heating for 20,000 people.[5]
In the 1990s the company decided not only to provide power generation equipment, but also to own and operate alternative and renewable energy power stations.
In 1991, the company, then as Ormat Industries, listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
In 1992, Ormat acquired a controlling stake of Bet Shemesh Engines, a manufactures parts for jet engines, that also overhauls, maintains and assembles jet engines. In 2005, Ormat sold its shares the company.[6]
In 2004, Ormat Technologies, completed an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange raising $100 million. Ormat Technologies was founded in 1994 as a US subsidiary of Ormat Industries. Following the initial public offering, Ormat Industries was restructured as a holding company that was still listed in the exchange, while shifting all its operations to the subsidiary Ormat Technologies.[7]
In 2006, Ormat received for the first time, an order for to supply equipment for a geothermal power plant in Germany.[citation needed]
In February 2015, Ormat Technologies Inc. acquired its parent company, Ormat Industries Ltd., in an all-stock merger. Shareholders of Ormat Technologies retained about 38 percent of the company’s shares, while Ormat Industries Ltd. shareholders owned the remaining 62 percent. Ormat Technologies Inc. shares were listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.[8]
Operations[edit]
The company owns and operates geothermal power plants in California, Nevada, Hawaii, Guatemala and Kenya.
Technologies[edit]

Thermal Energy[edit]
Ormat’s core technology is the Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) power generation unit. It converts low and medium temperature heat into electrical energy, with low or zero emission of CO2 and pollutants. The OEC's main components are a vaporizer/preheater, turbo-generator, air-cooled or water-cooled condenser, feed pump and controls. Ormat has installed more than 900 MW of geothermal and recovered energy generation (REG) power units, based on OEC technology.[citation needed]
Ormat’s technology is optimized for use in geothermal energy generation, and the company is the third largest geothermal producer in the United States. The technology is also suitable for recovered energy power generation, which converts waste heat from industrial processes into electricity that can be used on site or sold to power generation utilities. Ormat’s recovered energy technology was deployed in projects in Germany, Canada, India, USA and Japan.[citation needed]
Solar Energy[edit]
In the 1980s Ormat built and operated one of the world's first power stations to produce electricity from solar energy, located just north of the Dead Sea in Israel.[3] The plant utilized a technology known as solar pond, a large-scale solar thermal energy collector with integral heat storage for supplying thermal energy. It was the largest operating solar pond ever built for electricity generation and operated up until 1988. It had an area of 210,000 m² and gave an electrical output of 5 MW.[9]
After the decommissioning of the solar pool project Ormat was not active in the solar energy market until recently[when?] when it entered the Solar PV market.
Oil sands[edit]
Ormat's former parent company, Ormat Industries Ltd., developed an energy-efficient technology, OrCrude, for extracting crude oil from oil sands. The OrCrude process is claimed to be more efficient than other technologies as it includes gasification, which substantially reduces the requirement for natural gas, typically the largest input cost in an in-situ oil sands project. The technology is used in the Long Lake project, a former joint venture between Nexen and OPTI Canada.[10] In 2010, Ormat Industries sold all its holdings (5.1%) in OPTI Canada. In 2011, OPTI Canada was acquired by CNOOC Luxembourg S.à r.l, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CNOOC Limited.
Spin offs[edit]
Ormat has been involved in establishment and development of several companies, including:
Orbotech develops and manufactures automated optical inspection (AOI) systems for bare and assembled printed circuit boards and flat panel displays. The company's systems, imaging and computer-aided manufacturing technologies enable electronic manufacturers to achieve the increased yields and throughput essential for electronics production.
Orad Hi-Tec Systems Ltd. develops video and real-time image processing technologies for TV broadcasting, Internet, production studio and sports events.
