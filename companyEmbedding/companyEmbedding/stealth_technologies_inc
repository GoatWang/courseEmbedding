Stealth Technologies Announces 911 Help Now Generation II Product


/EINPresswire.com/ -- LARGO, FL--(Marketwired - December 06, 2016) -  Stealth Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: STTH), announced today the development of the 911 Help Now Generation II Product.
"As previously reported, the first generation product, Gen I 911 Help Now, has produced record sales during which we have received feedback from our distribution channels and customer market base expressing interest in upgrades to the current product including: longer battery standby, waterproofing, and upgraded encasement durability," said Brian McFadden, CEO.
In response to this identified market demand, Stealth Technologies has incorporated these changes into the development of the Gen II product and will soon launch a new waterproof unit to market with a 5-year battery standby time, housed in an upgraded aluminum and composite case, representing a substantial escalation in both the functionality and aesthetics of our original device.
"Concurrent with the introduction of the Gen II product to market, our strategic marketing analysis supports the continuation of our Gen I sales, thereby offering products at multiple price points in order to capture a broader audience in the marketplace," concluded McFadden.
About Stealth Technologies, Inc.
Stealth Technologies Inc. is a technology company focused on product development and sales in the personal financial protection and data protection businesses. Stealth Card, the company's first product to market, is designed to protect the RFID chip in a consumer's credit card from "electronic pickpocketing" that uses a smartphone, credit card reader or RFID antenna to remotely access data stored on the consumer's "Smartchip." Stealth Card renders the chipped information invisible or "Stealth" to intrusion.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements included in this update that are not historical in nature, are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, "forward-looking statements." Forward-looking statements may be identified by words including "anticipate," "believe," "intends," "estimates," "expect," and similar expressions. The Company cautions readers that forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those relating to the Company's future business prospects are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, due to factors such as those relating to economic, governmental, technological, and other risks and factors identified from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the SEC.

The device delivers direct 2-way voice communication with emergency service providers at the push of a button.The compact design runs off of standard AAA batteries, which sets 911 Help Now apart from other products in the industry by allowing the consumers to break free from required charging cables and cradles, opting instead for simply purchasing batteries on an as needed basis. In addition, the splash resistant one touch 24 hour emergency system provides a battery level indicator that produces a warning at 20% remaining life as batteries are starting to expire."You can take the 911 device with you jogging, driving, shopping and working to give yourself peace of mind in all environments," said CEO Brian McFadden. "We are currently advertising the 911 Help Now device on HSN (Home Shopping Network) and intend to expand its distribution to other Stealth Technologies distribution outlets.""We are pleased to announce this new product to market, and intend to continue to leverage the intellectual property of Stealth Technologies to grow our market share in the personal emergency and financial protection space," concluded McFadden.About Stealth Technologies, Inc.Stealth Technologies Inc. is a technology company focused on product development and sales in the personal financial protection and data protection businesses.

Waterfront Tower: Homestead, PA
Rooftop Concealments
In metropolitan and suburban areas alike, taking full advantage of the height of existing buildings is worth considering. Disguising or camouflaging antennas by topping a structure with a screen wall concealment, side mounted box concealment, pod or penthouse style concealment is an excellent option. Rooftop antenna concealment is what our concealment professionals specialize in.
Custom Concealments
Whether signal transmission equipment is located in urban or suburban locations, a custom freestanding concealment structure could become a community showpiece. STEALTH® offers design solutions to provide you with the best concealment to disguise or camouflage your antennas.
Church Concealments
STEALTH® has designed multiple steeple concealments, both modern and historic. Steeple designs range from steeple replacements to steeple extensions and even designs for new steeples on churches without one. Steeple concealments are a great option for camouflaging antennas.
Pole Concealments
While it’s tempting to look at poles as “cookie-cutter” antenna concealments, variables like wind speed tolerances and the location’s surroundings can dictate a more customized approach to even these simple-seeming antenna concealments.
Tree Concealments
Disguising or camouflaging antennas as a tree concealment is a great way to preserve the landscape of your town. Although this type of design is relatively simple, tree concealments require a certain amount of finesse.
DAS Concealments
Our DAS systems can be found in hallowed football stadiums, along beloved campus pathways, along municipal walkways and in some hard-to-reach spots. The need for DAS concealment and camouflage is increasing rapidly as more sites are switching to this option.
Small Cell Concealments
Historic cities, metro areas and college campuses often need small cell technology, but that doesn’t mean you have to look at it. Our small cell concealments are designed to fit into the surrounding atmosphere and remain invisible.
Pod Concealments
When a screenwall or chimney won’t do the trick, try a pod. STEALTH® offers two standard ballasted pod frames perfect for micro and macro sites. Not only do they accommodate the antennas you’re trying to hide, but also come with the radomes to conceal them.
