Margin trading involves interest charges and risks, including the potential to lose more than deposited or the need to deposit additional collateral in a falling market. The Margin Disclosure Statement and Agreement (PDF) is available for download, or it is available at one of our branch offices. It contains information on our lending policies, interest charges, and the risks associated with margin accounts.

Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Detailed information on our policies and the risks associated with options can be found in the Scottrade® Options Application and Agreement, Brokerage Account Agreement, by downloading the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options and Supplements (PDF) from The Options Clearing Corporation, or by requesting a copy by contacting Scottrade. Supporting documentation for any claims will be supplied upon request. Consult with your tax advisor for information on how taxes may affect the outcome of these strategies. Keep in mind, profit will be reduced or loss worsened, as applicable, by the deduction of commissions and fees.
Market volatility, volume and system availability may impact account access and trade execution.

Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk, it does not assure a profit, or protect against loss, in a down market.

A prospectus contains this and other information about the fund and may be obtained online or by contacting Scottrade.  The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Leveraged and inverse ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the use of leverage, short sales of securities, derivatives and other complex investment strategies. These funds’ performance will likely be significantly different than their benchmark over periods of more than one day, and their performance over time may in fact trend opposite of their benchmark. Investors should monitor these holdings, consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily.

Margin

The loss can include more than the principal amount invested. Terms and conditions, risk statement and margin statement available on Scottrade.com.

Exchange-Traded Funds





ETFs represent a basket of securities – such as stocks and bonds – and they trade throughout the day on an exchange like a stock.










ETFs are professionally managed and designed in many cases to track the performance of an index. Scottrade provides access to most ETFs, which can be used to employ many investment strategies.

		        	Explore Bonds 




















International Investing





Scottrade offers investment exposure to over 20 foreign markets through American Depository Receipts (ADRs). ADRs represent one or more shares of non-U.S. stocks, but are traded domestically, which can help reduce the complexities associated with trading directly in foreign markets. In addition, Scottrade offers a variety of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold securities in countries around the globe, including developed and emerging nations.
