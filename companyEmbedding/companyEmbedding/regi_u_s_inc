Heat Pump, Gen-Set, Combined Cycle
The possible applications are mindboggling.The impact is game-changing.
Simple... RadMax radically reduces the unique part count, reducing manufacturing, assembly, inventory, and maintenance costs.
Efficient... RadMax delivers better than 1 HP per pound of engine weight and more than 1.5 HP per cubic inch of engine displacement.
Compact... RadMax engines, pumps and compressors are between 3 to 5 times smaller than comparable devices.  Radmax devices will also weigh up to 3 times less than other engines, pumps or compressors of the same power rating.
Powerful... RadMax's compact size and high output result in up to 6 times the size and weight-savings over a piston engine of the same horsepower.
Smaller Carbon Footprint... RadMax devices are some of the lightest and most efficient ever designed. Not only are they more fuel efficient than comparable output devices, they require a lower manufacturing footprint. This means less material, shorter manufacturing timeframes, fewer man-hours, and less weight for shipping.


Dividend Update 


 The RadMax Rotary Technology utilizes patented sliding vanes that move over a cam to compress gasses, move fluids or expand gasses to generate power from combustion or other high pressure sources of energy.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Business Services
Business Screening Services for Businesses Extending Credit
Fast, accurate, and affordable Business Credit Reports are available to individuals and business owners. Before you tie your financial future to a business, learn if they pay their bills on-time, or if they are in financial difficulties. Discover if they have bankruptcy filings or judgments for collections against them. Any Business Credit Report can be provided in less than one hour during business hours.
Before you sign and shake on it, find out what sort of business you are dealing with. Business credit reports are a necessity to take risk out of a new venture.
 
Our AAA Business Credit Reports are nationwide and include:

Trade information showing a company's payment history
Public record information such as; 			     

Bankruptcies (updated daily) 
UCC filings (updated bi-weekly) 
Bank loans (if they exist) 
Leasing information (where available) 


Factual risk indicator using a "days beyond term" score to indicate risk potential 
Monthly/quarterly payment trends showing a company's performance over time 
Comparative Industry Data which shows a business' payment performance relative to the industry as a whole for easy evaluation

If you lease to commercial clients and would like to do a credit check on a company instead of an individual, this is called a commercial credit check. Small business credit reports can help you when you're trying to decide when to extend credit to buyers, purchase interest in another company, gain a competitive advantage or just check to see how others will view your company.
These reports provide a snapshot of a company's financial status, showing creditors, debts, sales numbers and bankruptcies. AAA commercial credit check is a comprehensive business profile report.
 
IntelliscorePlus Business Report
Make critical credit decisions through a streamlined single-inquiry process that draws upon Experian’s comprehensive commercial and owner data using Intelliscore PlusSM. IntelliscorePlus Report sample
 
Business Profile:  The Business Profile report presents a current, objective picture of how a business handles its financial obligations.
Business Profile Report sample

Make effective business decisions
Business Profile report provides actual trade payment experiences, public record information, company background, and comparative data, placing a company's payment performance in context with its industry.
Objective view of credit performance
The information is reliable, accurate and unbiased, allowing for an objective view of a company's overall financial health. 
Know the risk
Minimize risk by knowing all the credit attributes of a business.

 
Business Summary:  The Business Summary report is an affordable credit report for low-balanced accounts (generally considered to be less than $1000). The summary analyzes the account's current trade experiences, determines the presence or absence of collection data and derogatory public record filings, and then classifies the account into risk categories. It is not as comprehensive as the Business Profile Report for only a few dollars more.

Listed below are the checks and searches that our company offers which can be customized for you:

State and County Criminal Records Check
Credit Report
Bankruptcy Search
Civil Search

Nanny Screening
Our Nanny Background Screening Solutions help you make well informed and confident decisions to avoid potential future problems with the person you will trust with your children. Providing factual information you need to know about the individual; does the candidate have a criminal record? Has he/she lived here for the last five years? How has he/she worked out in other jobs with other families or institutions? Does he/she really have the credentials/licenses claimed? Can I really trust him/her with my children and my home? Can a simple test or interview provide the information you need?

Landlords Services
Tenant Screening for Landlords and Realtors
Look before you lease. You can reduce damage to your property, improve long-term occupancy, decrease late payments, and eliminate criminal activity (for which you may be liable) in your properties. Our tenant screening service checks current public records and credit information, as well as personally interviewing not just the tenant’s current landlord (who may have reasons for wanting the tenant out of his property), but also the previous landlord, who will often disclose information not available from any other source. Find out what they are like as tenants, before you hand them the keys.
Tenant Screening Report Details
Our tenant background reports are nationwide, not just local. The following is included in the tenant screening reports:

Rental history verification for current and previous rentals.
Employment verification (and salary where possible). 
Checking account verification. 
Optional inclusion of criminal record checks in tenant screening reports. 

 
Complete tenant credit reports are included in our tenant background reports. They are nationwide and contain the following:

Social security number check to identify misused or recently issued numbers and numbers of deceased persons. 
Address check to identify misused addresses and potential problems such as mail receiving services or prison drop addresses. 
Employment information verification where available. 

 
Public record items if they exist, such as:

Tax liens (reported for 7 years after the lien is filed) 
Judgments (reported for 7 years after the judgment entered) 
Chapter 7 bankruptcies (reported for 10 years following the bankruptcy) 
Chapter 13 bankruptcies (reported for 7 years following the bankruptcy) 
Collection items (if they exist) and their status 
Up to 7 years of credit history 
A list of companies making inquiries into the individual's credit file 
A list of member companies (creditors) and their phone numbers

If you lease or sell commercial space and would like to do a credit check on a company instead of an individual, this is called a commercial credit check. Small business credit reports can help you when you're trying to decide when to extend credit to buyers, purchase interest in another company, gain a competitive advantage or just check to see how others will view your company.
These reports provide a snapshot of a company's financial status, showing creditors, debts, sales numbers and bankruptcies. REGIUS Inc commercial credit check is a comprehensive business profile report.
 
Risk assessment:  In most cases, credit reports for business customers will include a credit score to help determine financial risk. This is similar to a consumer credit rating. Information regarding legal filings, collections, trade payment information and totals, monthly and quarterly payment trends, UCC filings and banking relationships.
Basic company information: Reports often include annual sales, number of employees and EIN numbers, as well as information about the owners.
 
Financial information:  Business credit reporting usually includes a list of a company's vendors, the amount of debt they are owed and if the company is current or delinquent.
 
US commercial credit checks are available during business hours only. Please note, that for companies that have not been in business for 6 months or greater, it is recommended that you also order a credit check on the owner of the company. Business owners can glean quite a bit of information about companies, including their own, just by using business credit reports.
 
IntelliscorePlus Business Report:  Make critical credit decisions through a streamlined single-inquiry process that draws upon Experian’s comprehensive commercial and owner data using Intelliscore PlusSM.
Business Profile:  The Business Profile report presents a current, objective picture of how a business handles its financial obligations.

 Reg Technologies Inc. & REGI U.S., Inc. Announce Device that Reduces Temperature in RadMax™ Moving 
         










    










 






 











 









Reg Technologies Inc. & REGI U.S., Inc. Announce Device that Reduces Temperature in RadMax™ Moving Parts

Sep 29, 2011, 06:00 ET
		  		  							
						 from   Reg Technologies Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Sept. 29, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- REGI U.S., Inc. (OTC BB: RGUS, Frankfurt Stock Exchange: RGJ) and Reg Technologies Inc. (TSX Venture Exchange: RRE.V, OTC BB: REGRF) are pleased to announce that they have integrated a rotary union into the RadMax™ fabrication process, to reduce temperature in the RadMax™ demonstration model.
Robert Grisar, Vice President of Engineering for REGI U.S., Inc. said, "This device allows us to provide continuous high-pressure lubrication and cooling oil to moving and rotating parts of RadMax, thus allowing the engine to operate at a lower temperature. Oil is injected by this device into a hollow driveshaft, with exit ports inside the rotor. This in turn allows us to use lighter components made from Aluminum which further reduces the weight of the engine."
A detailed thermodynamic analysis of the patented RadMax engine was performed last year in conjunction with Belcan Engineering Services of Phoenix, AZ. As a result, integration of the rotary union was needed to provide lubrication oil to internal components. Without this device, the internal engine heat would make adoption of aluminum components impossible. By reducing heat, and weight, this leads to enhanced fuel economy in every RadMax™ application.
This integration was one of the fabrication steps that were described in the RadMax™ test and certification process presented in our March 8, 2011 news release.
A picture of the rotary union is available on the Companies' respective websites at www.regtech.com (Reg Technologies Inc.) and www.regiinc.com (REGI U.S., Inc.).  The following are direct links:

ABOUT REGI U.S., INC. AND REG TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Reg Technologies Inc. and REGI U.S., Inc. are developing for commercialization an improved axial vane type rotary engine known as the Rand Cam™/RadMax™ rotary technology used in the revolutionary design of lightweight and high efficiency engines, compressors and pumps. The RadMax™ engine has only two unique moving parts, the vanes (up to 12) and the rotor, compared to the 40 moving parts in a simple four-cylinder piston engine.   This innovative design makes it possible to produce up to 24 continuous power impulses per one rotation that is vibration-free and extremely quiet.   The RadMax™ engine also has multi-fuel capabilities allowing it to operate on fuels including gasoline, natural gas, hydrogen, propane and diesel.  For more information, please visit www.regtech.com    or www.regiinc.com.
