Sequans Communications: A Comeback In The Making - Sequans Communications (NYSE:SQNS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»Sequans Communications: A Comeback In The MakingJul.14.16 | About: Sequans Communications (SQNS) Kevin Whalen Growth, momentum, Deep Value, event-drivenSummary2011 shifts in WiMAX technology put Sequans Communications in a tough competitive position.Sequans quickly modernized their product portfolio to focus on key growth prospects.The new product applications are well positioned for industry growth, while Sequans forges key certifications and partnerships.Revenue and gross margins appear to be showing positive trends for the first time in years. Sequans IPO When it went public in 2010, Sequans Communications (NYSE: SQNS) was a blossoming chip producer positioned heavily in WiMAX hardware. WiMAX is a high-speed wireless broadband service similar to Wi-Fi, but it can accommodate a broader traffic flow. At the time, it appeared that some cities were looking at implementing this service for residents. President Obama even traveled to Marquette, MI, in February 2011 to speak about the impact WiMAX had on local business and university distance learning. It looked as though WiMAX would soon be the dominant technology. However, Long Term Evolution also was emerging as a competitive standard for wireless connectivity. Sprint (NYE: S) had already invested in a WiMAX network, while AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) both committed to LTE networks. LTE is said to have benefits over WiMAX, including more bandwidth, reduced latency and easier integration into existing cell frequencies. At the time, Sprint's strategy began evolving to focus on adding the iPhone to its network. In part because of these reasons, Sprint began planning their own LTE network investment with LightSquared, marking the beginning of the end for WiMAX in the U.S. The Remains At the close of 2012, Sequans recorded $22.3 million in sales, marking a 77% decline from the previous year. Q4 of that year contributed a dismal $3.1 million in revenue and 9.4% gross margin. Sequans went through an overwhelming decrease in stock value while trailing industry peers in technology, breadth of line and financial strength. They would likely sit on aging inventory while their product strategy remained nebulous. If this company were to return confidence to their shareholders, it would require a significant shift in focus. NPD and Strategy Emerge Fast forward to the present day and the company has a well-defined product strategy, targeting growth in an expanding 4G LTE network. CEO Georges Karam focused on a niche strategy within IoT and M2M devices, while most industry peers went after the larger mobile device market. Their product range is small by comparison, but this strategy has created an exclusive offer that is positioned to prevail. Internet of Things The Internet of Things (IoT) is disrupting the world, paving the way for smart cities and connected consumer devices. There is a tremendous profit opportunity in the entire supply chain of IoT. Research predicts that worldwide IoT chip revenue will reach $10.78 billion by 2022 (Research and Markets, 2016). That's all great in theory, but with industry peers chasing this same opportunity, why should we count on Sequans to win market share? Peers like Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) do have IoT focus, but their portfolio is more concentrated on short-range Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connected devices rather than LTE optimization at this time. Broadcom also has an advantage of offering bundled hardware solutions to their customers, but they still cannot offer a comparable product solution to Sequans. Larger peers also need to divide resources across managing robust SKU portfolios, which can strain employee focus and form bottlenecks in operations. Comparably, Sequans may be more agile, allowing their leadership team to focus purely on 4G LTE profit contribution. If you're not convinced that Sequans can compete, let's look at product performance. In 2015, Sequans took home an "IoT Innovation Award" from Connected World Magazine for their CAT 1 trials with Verizon and Ericcson. No more than a year later they were honored with "Most Innovative IoT/M2M Strategy" by Leading Lights for their new CAT M technology. Sequans has three IoT platforms under the names Monarch, Calliope and Colibri. These provide CAT M, CAT 1, and CAT 4 classes, respectively. CAT M and CAT 1 are the only ones of their kind in the market, providing low cost and power consumption solutions for devices that require smaller data transfers (e.g., utility meters, asset trackers, and health sensors). On the other hand, the Colibri platform can support more robust connections required for tablets, routers and PCs. There are still more proprietary benefits, including CAT M's dynamic power management technology, which uses less power (saving you battery life) while also promising up to 15 years of operation (helping reduce warranty claims for manufacturers). Finally, Sequans introduced Sequans AIR in their CAT4 chip, which is an active interference rejection technology. As our LTE networks get more and more crowded, service providers need to find solutions to support higher traffic. Sequans AIR allows service providers to handle twice the network capacity and provides a throughput increase of three and a half times, which will allow companies like Verizon to offer better service to their consumers. VoLTE Sequans CAT 1 and CAT 4 chips support Voice over LTE (VoLTE). Sequans is the first to bring VoLTE capability to a CAT 1 chip and the first to have it certified by Verizon. Compared to a traditional voice connection, VoLTE is said to provide a better quality sound and a more stable connection. However, where I see its largest opportunity is within IoT rather than traditional cellular applications. The verbal command creates an opportunity to enhance multi-tasking and replace some uses of touch screens. An example of this is for wearable health trackers, which may have compact screens that are difficult to navigate by touch. Peers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) also can provide VoLTE, but the unique positioning for Sequans is the low-cost and low-power CAT 1 product. Low-cost components help device manufacturers reduce COGS, expanding gross profit margin and also reducing consumer barrier to entry at more affordable retails. Modems and Routers Sequans supplies chips for more robust devices as well, including modems and routers for residential and industrial applications. Their design wins extend to major names such as D-Link and Netgear. Verizon's JetPack produced in partnership with NETGEAR is a 4G LTE hot spot. Verizon is a great partner for Sequans as they can invest heavily in partnered product marketing support. In addition, Verizon's Q1 earnings presentation shows a steady growth in 4G LTE devices. Though most of these are phones, this growth rate is encouraging for the platform as a whole. 

 Verizon has recently increased the retail of their JetPack substantially, which may pose a risk to chip volume. Sequans also has potential to support Reliance Jio in India, though it is not currently in the forecast. Reliance is planning on rolling out their network in late 2016 to their 30,000,000 subscribers, and is testing on 500,000 subscribers this year. As a basis for population with disposable income it may be fair to compare to the middle class population in India estimated at 50,000,0000. According to Ernst & Young, that same middle class is predicted to reach an incredible 200,000,000 in just five years. Certifications and Partnerships Partnerships are forged on a few different levels and typically require collaboration for a successful launch. Network service providers are the key to Sequans' distribution success. A component would never be considered by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) unless it earned validation for the end network. Therefore, it is important that both CAT 1 and CAT 4 chipsets have been validated by Verizon and AT&T. Sequans can now open up more opportunities with major consumer devices selling through these network providers. Sequans is additionally working to certify their CAT 1 chip with Telstra, which would open up their distribution to Australian networks. Other important partnerships forming include LTE for Thales aviation and a new partnership with Socle Technologies. Socle is a subsidiary of Foxconn, which I find very intriguing. Based on Foxconn's relationships with global technology manufacturers, this could be a great opportunity for Sequans' expansion. Financial Performance and Investment Value At the close of 2015, Sequans grew revenue to $32.7 million, a 45% increase over 2014. This is still a far cry from 2011's $93.7 million. To date, Sequans is not a profitable company, but they are effectively closing the gap in their operating loss. For example, their 2015 annual operating loss of $23.6 million compares favorably to a loss of $34 million in 2014. Q1 2016 also suggests that this trend may continue. In 2016, Sequans lost just $5.2 million, while in the first quarter of 2015 that number was $8.2 million. The weight of this operating loss to revenue also is improving due to an increase in design wins. 

 (Source: Etrade Research) Investors should be aware that the company has been in a tight cash position though, burning through 46% of their cash in the past two quarters. Because of this, they've recently issued an additional $7 million in convertible debt. Where Sequans has substantial pressure is on their gross margin contribution, which has struggled for years. Luckily, the company reached 40% gross margins at the close of 2015, a 33% increase over the previous year. In addition, Q1 2016 margins were 47.5%, which may indicate Sequans is returning to parity within the industry. Even with this accomplishment, peers like Qualcomm have heftier gross margins of 59%. Qualcomm also provides a stable 4% yield, helping cover any short-term volatility in the market. The point is that there are different investment strategies depending on if you are seeking value or speculative growth. Investors may look past these short-term issues if they are seeking a speculative growth addition to their portfolio. According to Yahoo Finance, six analysts have an average price target of $3.50 per share, while it currently resides around $2.21 per share. Closing Remarks Sequans met a horrible fate while the market landscape evolved but adapted during this inflection point. Their product portfolio today is relatively small but unique in performance and exclusive for market applications in the short term. The company must continue to innovate their product portfolio in order to maintain shareholder confidence since industry peers can invest heavily in new product development. The company also needs to prove they can return to 55% or greater gross margins like their counterparts. Finally, they need to turn an operating profit and manage their cash positions more conservatively. Overall, their product portfolio today is one that meets a niche market need for low-cost and low-power chips. The booming IoT category will create enough opportunity for the majority of competitors to succeed. Though I'm confident in the payoff for design wins over the next three to five years, I'm not yet convinced Sequans can maintain proprietary advantages beyond the five-year mark. In the end, Sequans' growth in revenue, reduction in operating loss, certifications and proprietary product features are indicators of a hidden growth opportunity overshadowed by its peers.

Sequans: The Opportunity Ahead - Sequans Communications (NYSE:SQNS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»Sequans: The Opportunity AheadMay.23.17 | About: Sequans Communications (SQNS) Gary Milne Special situations, Growth, long-term horizonSummarySequans' 40% YoY growth in its broadband LTE business looks sustainable.Sequans Calliope LTE Cat-1 chipset sales set to grow by hundreds of percentage points in 2017.LTE will be the dominant provider of connectivity for mobile IoT devices, and Sequans is well positioned.Sequans sells 3-4 million single-mode LTE chipsets per year. With the IoT potential measured in billions, the growth could be explosive.The low cost, small size, and long battery life of LTE Cat M chips will enable the largest wave of innovation since the smartphone, and Sequans is a leading provider.This is my third article on Sequans (NYSE:SQNS), you can find the others here and here. While the past articles took the form of a short and punchy "top ten" list, I decided to embrace an essay style article that would be more accessible to a broader and less technical audience. On the date of my first article, the stock closed at $1.65/share. At the time of writing the stock is around $4.00, having hit a new 52-week high of $4.23 on May 9th. The blue line in the chart below shows the volume for the 10-day moving average. Clearly, the interest in Sequans has been growing steadily since late last year and especially so over the last two months. 

 Despite the stock having more than doubled in the past six months, I believe the market is still waking up to the potential of Sequans and the significance of single mode LTE in the nascent Internet of Things market. Hopefully, by reading this article, you will also come to realize the potential of Sequans to electrify your portfolio. This article is broken into the following parts for easier comprehension:  Part 1 - Broadband LTE - Sequans Streamrich segment Part 2 - Internet of Things - Sequans Streamlite segment Part 3 - Why LTE will be the dominant LPWAN technology Part 4 - Why Sequans offers the best opportunity in LTE 
 Sequans Product Lineup Sequans designs and sells single mode LTE chips. Typical cell phone chips are multi-mode and capable of falling back to 3G or 2G as required. These extra fallback capabilities come at a cost, with multi-mode chips being larger, more complex, power hungry, and more expensive. Now that LTE coverage is widely available, the cheaper single mode LTE chips have become attractive, a very significant consideration when dealing with billions of devices. Sequans created the first single mode LTE chipset and leads the market in this area. Sequans has two product categories, Streamrich for high-speed LTE and Streamlite for IoT devices. The capabilities and primary uses of each of these products are shown in the table below. 

 *NB1(aka NB IoT\Cat-M2\LTE Cat-M2) operates at 40Kbps DL/55Kbps UL. A Note on Terminology When low-speed LTE was introduced in release 13, it was originally known as Cat-M and had two sub-classes, Cat M1 and Cat M2. Together, these are often called LTE-M, Cat M, or LTE Cat M. While the name Cat M1 remains in everyday use, Cat M2 has morphed and is now more commonly known as NB-IoT or NB1 (NB = narrow band). Part 1 - Broadband LTE - Sequans Streamrich Segment The Streamrich segment deals with broadband LTE solutions with speeds nominally in the range of 50Mbps-300Mbps. Most commonly, these are home and portable routers, providing high-speed internet access without a permanent connection such as cable or DSL. Although Sequans does not break out its revenue by segment, it did provide sufficient commentary during its Q1 earnings call for it to be deduced. "This market continues to account for our three-quarters of our total revenue in the first quarter." - Georges Karam.
 This statement would place the broadband business at $9.3 million in Q1. Later in the same call, Georges Karam [CEO] said this about broadband revenue for 2017. "Based on the strong momentum we are seeing, we continue to believe the Broadband Data Device business will exceed $10 million quarterly run rate by the end of this year, and could even reach $12 million per quarter by year-end, if the new devices ramp quickly. Also, this target assumes revenue from India or China would be considered as potential upside." In Q1, broadband revenue was already at $9.3 million but we have had a steady stream of announcements on broadband partners since then.  April 3rd, 2017 - Verve Connect LTE Hub  April 21st, 2017 - Verizon Jetpack Hotspot  May 10th, 2017 - Comba Telecom Router (China) Two OEMs added in Q1 (mentioned in Q1 earnings call)  Of course, some of these are expected wins and may already be factored into the company's broadband sales estimates for 2017. However, I believe the company has been prudently cautious in setting expectations and has good potential to hit the high-end of its guidance. In my past articles on Sequans, I have focused heavily on its Streamlite (NYSEMKT:IOT) product family as the growth engine of the company, and certainly, the potential there is huge. But I have performed a disservice to the contribution and growth of its broadband business. With YoY growth in Q1 of 33%, most of this was driven by its broadband business, so it's worth taking a closer look at this market. The Broadband LTE Market A consumer can buy the new Verizon Ellipsis Jetpack MHS900L, which contains the Sequans Colibri chipset, for $29.99 with a two-year contract. On top of that, a customer would pay $15/mo for 1Gb of data and then $10 per each additional Gb. Alternately, a consumer can choose to pay $85/mo for unlimited data. Neither of these plans is likely to appeal as a replacement for most wired home internet connections at those prices. But broadband LTE does have the advantage of being portable, making it ideal for mobile solutions such as cars, buses, trains, or temporary events such as trade shows and conventions. While solutions for these scenarios exist today, the Sequans Cat 4 Colibri chipset can achieve speeds up to 150Mbps, and users can enjoy familiar desktop speeds on the go.
 While the economics in the US prohibit explosive growth, it is a different story elsewhere. In Central London, you can get a one-year contract with internet provider Relish; Â£99 ($125) down gets you a broadband LTE hub and Â£25 ($33) a month for a 24Mbit connection and unlimited data. Relish uses the Verve Connect LTE hub powered by a Sequans Colibri chipset. In France, you can get 100Gb/mo of LTE data for â¬19.99 ($22) from provider Free. Slowly, LTE is making inroads into the traditional wired marketplace. If you think that can't happen in the US, that the big carriers have too big of a lock on the market, then you would be partly correct. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are not likely to lower their pricing sufficiently to make broadband LTE competitive for most home users anytime soon; streaming of video is just too data intensive for their existing LTE networks. While broadband LTE is not mainstream in the US, there are forces on the horizon that are about to change the dynamics and economics of the LTE market in dramatic ways. The Future is Wireless The days of home internet being dominated by wired connections are coming to an end. Does this sound like an audacious claim? Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) doesn't think so. Google Fiber is cancelling orders and restructuring its business. Digging up streets and pulling fiber to every home is just too expensive and time consuming. So, what is causing Google to rethink its internet business? The 3.5GHz Spectrum In the US, the FCC has undertaken an innovative departure from its previous approach to spectrum allocation. Rather than have a range of spectrum dedicated to one specific purpose, the FCC has approved a model that allows spectrum to be shared on a hierarchical priority basis. This range of spectrum in the 3.5GHz range (3,550MHz - 3,575MHz) is known as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service or CBRS, also called the Innovative Band by some. The properties of the 3.5 GHz range place it in the "sweet spot" of the spectrum for use in communications, making it well suited for high-speed wireless communications. The shared spectrum will have three tenants at different priorities. The incumbent usage methods have the highest priority, paying lessees for a geographic area will have the second highest priority, and private citizens will have the lowest level of priority.
 What has all this to do with broadband LTE? Once CBRS is approved for public use, anyone (yes, even you) can set up an LTE network using these frequencies, without having to pay a license fee for the spectrum. This takes the LTE monopoly out of the hands of the telcos and opens a huge door for other service providers to step through. Enter Google and Others Google is embracing 3.5GHz as a better option to provide high speed internet to the home. Google sought permission from the FCC to test this innovative technology using the CBRS band in up to 24 markets and has been heavily involved in establishing the required standards and testing bodies to support CBRS deployment. Verizon, AT&T, Sprint (NYSE:S), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) are all members of the CBRS alliance, as are Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Alphabet, and many others. This is not a standard that lacks for industry support. Certainly, the telcos must see CBRS as an opportunity and a threat. The opportunity to expand their footprint into the home internet market must be enticing. AT&T has petitioned the FCC to set up early trials in the 3.5GHz band, and Verizon is already engaged in testing. With the cellular phone market in the US being saturated, the addition of high-performance spectrum at much lower licensing costs makes the possibility of expanding their services into the home market a very attractive growth opportunity. While it is not expected that the FCC will grant operating licenses (tier 2 of the 3 priority tiers) until 2018, there is clearly industry momentum behind CBRS. It will take some time for broadband LTE to become competitive in the US because CBRS has added complexities. However, in other parts of the world (China, for example), where shared spectrum is a not a requirement, the 3.5GHz range is already is gaining ground and is often mentioned in connection with 5G, the next big leap in LTE speeds. Sequans already has LTE solutions that operate at 3.5GHz and only require a software modification to operate on CBRS, so it is well positioned for this growth area.
 Sequans is currently achieving significant growth in its Streamrich segment, and technology trends strongly suggest that growth in broadband LTE will continue and most likely increase over time. Part 2 - Sequans Streamlite Segment The Streamlite segment represents Sequans solutions for the IoT market, industrial, commercial or consumer. Devices in this category are relatively low bandwidth, low power solutions, and due to their simpler single mode design are cheap relative to their multi-mode predecessors. This segment offers three products in two categories which are discussed below. Part 2A - Sequans Calliope - LTE Cat 1 The Sequans Calliope Cat 1 (<10Mbps) LTE chipset is primarily designed for wearables. As such, it is highly optimized for size, power, and speed. The table below lists some of the key events in the evolution of the Sequans Calliope. As I pointed out in one of my earlier articles, the Sequans Calliope is included as part of the Verizon Wearable Reference Kit.   Event Date   Product Introduction January 6th, 2015   First Cat 1 LTE Module with Gemalto September 1st, 2015   Certified on Verizon July 23rd, 2015   Certified on NTT Docomo March 9th, 2016   Certified for VoLTE on Verizon April 27th, 2016   Certified on AT&T May 26th, 2016   Certified on T-Mobile ~August 30th, 2016   Certified for VoLTE on T-Mobile February 28th, 2017   Despite the availability of this product on both major US networks for over a year, it does not seem to have made much impression. We can deduce the approximate quarterly revenue contribution by Cat 1 as follows.  2017 Q1 revenue of $12.4 million. Broadband "accounts for our three-quarters of our total revenue in the first quarter", leaving $3.1 million. Other revenue for Q1 of 2017 was $2.8 million. Monarch product line is not yet contributing. Therefore, Cat 1 revenue is $300,000 or less in Q1.  I can buy a Gemalto Cinterion ELS31 module (containing a Sequans OEM Cat 1 chip) for about $38, probably significantly cheaper in bulk. For easy math, let's say the ELS31 module is $30 in bulk and that Gemalto pays Sequans $15 for the Cat 1 chipset. That would generate an approximate sales rate of around 20,000 units/quarter. This is a paltry amount for a chipset that has been certified on four major networks totaling 426 million subscribers!
 Sequans created the single mode LTE market and evangelizing takes time and effort. While uptake in Cat 1 has been slow in 2016, the comments made by Georges Karam [CEO] in the Q1 earnings call indicate confidence in its growth in 2017.    "After accumulating design wins at both, the device and module level all last year, Cat 1 products will fuel our growth in 2017" "we have projects where the people selected Gemalto or selected us its for three four years project. So, it really gives us a lot of visibility and confidence that the revenue will be there for the CAT-1" "we are seeing several customers choosing to ramp their CAT-1 products on more than one carrier's network â¦ We are pleased to note that we are beginning to build the backlog" "We have received orders for our CAT-1 customers, and we are moving to full production."  I contacted the company regarding what it meant to enter "full production" for Cat 1. Thus far, Cat 1 production has been sufficient for "providing samples or small quantities for testing and limited trials". Full production simply means it will be producing chips based on customer orders. Below is a list of known customers using Sequans Cat 1 chipset.   Geotab to use Sequans Cat 1  Wisol to make Cat 1 modules  Encore Networks EN-1000 Router  NimbeLink Skywire Cat 1 modem  Gemalto ELS31 Modules  Autonet in car connectivity  Witivity IoT Modem  In April, Sequans announced a partnership with Geotab, a vehicle and telematics company. Geotab has only one hardware product, the Go7 which will be updated to use Sequans Cat 1 and presumably named the Go8 (it has trademarked the name). Geotab has over 700,000 devices under management today, and vehicle telematics is a rapidly expanding field. Estimating a device life of five years and continued growth, an annual run rate in the range of 100,000-150,000 units/year would seem likely. This one customer would more than double Sequans Cat 1 quarterly sales rate. At the time of writing, Geotab has not yet released its Go8 product, but I expect this is part of Sequans Cat 1 pipeline.
 Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) In a typical smartphone, voice and data are two discrete types of communication that use different components of the phone and separate channels of communication. Like its cousin VoIP, VoLTE converts voice communication into data and passes it exclusively over the data network. This capability opens the door for wearables to encompass a much higher degree of functionality than they do today. People are becoming more comfortable speaking to their cell phones and tablets with phrases like "OK Google", "Alexa" or "Siri". Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo Dot has proven that a consumer device does not require a screen to be successful. The technology and infrastructure are available today, and it's only a matter of time before wearables emerge that can provide a rich experience, much like that experienced on larger devices from Amazon and Google but with the important addition of being entirely mobile and able to place and receive phone calls, texts, or emails. Sequans Cat 1 Future With the current customer list, it seems probable that Cat 1 growth is likely to increase by hundreds of percentage points as it moves into full production. But Cat 1 has some interesting prospects in the wearable space, it was part of the Verizon Wearables Reference Kit after all, and with the ability to support VoLTE, it seems likely one or more consumer oriented wearables will launch during 2017. Given the highly innovative and competitive nature of new tech devices, even their existence are closely guarded secrets. Similarly, Sequans is also bound to secrecy regarding which companies are building solutions using their technology. While the company forecasts a Cat 1 ramp, it is likely to manifest as a stair-step, as electronics manufacturers build significant inventory prior to launch. Part 2B - Sequans Monarch - LTE Cat M1/NB1 While LTE standards have typically pushed to higher data rates, release 13 introduced two new low speed options, Cat M1 (<1 Mbps) and Cat NB1 (aka M2 or NB IoT) (<250Kbps). These two new standards allow for very low power usage (sleep mode) and greater signal range. Sequans recognized the opportunity provided by these new standards to create a low-cost LTE chip that could operate for years on a single battery. At the right price point, such a chip could greatly fuel the adoption of the Internet of Things. With these goals in mind, Sequans created the world's first single mode Cat M1\NB1 chip, the Sequans Monarch.
 Sequans Monarch The Monarch was announced in February of 2016, a tiny chip that measures 8.5mm x 6.5mm (55mm2). By January 2017, the Monarch was certified for operation on the Verizon network, and Gemalto had released a module (EMS31) that used the Monarch chip. Sequans has been steadily building an impressive ecosystem around its Monarch chip as demonstrated in the table below.  Sequans Monarch EcoSystem  Networks Module Makers Developer Platforms Customers   Verizon - Certified w/VoLTE Gemalto STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) Orion Labs   T-Mobile - Certified w/VoLTE Huawei Arduino NimbeLink   AT&T - End of Q2 SIMCom Raspberry Pi Link Labs     Fibocom TI BeagleBone Black Encore Networks     Wisol STMicro Nucleo pycom       Renesas         NXP Freedom     Naturally, there is a considerable lag between the availability of a chip and the commercial availability of products using that chip. In the Q1 earnings call, Georges Karam [CEO] stated they are not currently shipping Monarch in any meaningful volume and do not expect the revenue stream from Monarch to materialize until Q4 of 2017. My expectations are that once Monarch revenue starts in Q4, it will ramp very quickly, and I'll explain why. Internet of Things Adoption Over the years, as we have moved from mainframes, to PCs, to smartphones and tablets, the number of devices has increased tenfold with each generation. At the same time, the device cost has decreased exponentially. 

 While no one agrees on how many devices will be added to the Internet of Things by 2020, all agree that it will be measured in the billions. An excellent list of 61 different IoT sensor use cases can be found on the Libelium site. Many of these use cases are represented in the diagram below.
 

 (Source: Libelium.com) Given the price of $7-8 for a Monarch module, we will certainly see many industrial IoT sensors below $50. This is a huge market that will evolve over the next decade or more, adding billions of sensors worldwide and improving the efficiency and quality of many aspects of industry and the environment. However, the industrial internet is only part of the picture and, in my estimation, will not be where the most immediate growth happens. The low cost, small size, and long battery life of Cat M1 chips will lead to the largest wave of innovation in the electronics industry since the arrival of the smartphone. The graphic below illustrates some of the many ways in which Cat M1 technology may reach into our everyday lives. 

 (Source: Microsoft IoT Presentation) While some of these devices exist today, the introduction of cheap and reliable connectivity gives device manufacturers a vast and fertile ground with which to enhance or develop compelling solutions for consumers. Here are a few simple examples: A small tracker that shows the location of any object on a map, children, pets, vehicles, bicycles, cargo, parcels, cell phones etc. A clip for seniors that detects falls and allows them to call for help. Vending machines that notify owners of exact inventory levels. Sports trackers that do not require cell phone proximity. Health monitoring devices that feed information to your patient record.
 We don't know when these products will arrive, what they will look like, which ones will be flops or which will have amazing success. What we do know is that the opportunity brought about by LTE Cat M1 chips is vast and that it has the potential to provide huge rewards for those companies that make successful devices. Where cell phones and tablets have close to a 1:1 relationship to humans, IoT device density estimates range from 10:1 to 50:1 in industrialized nations. With such a huge opportunity to make innovative devices and the potential to sell them by the tens of millions, the incentive to enter this market is extremely high. Investing in Sequans is bet across this entire spectrum of innovation. Monarch SX In January of 2017, Sequans announced the Monarch SX, a System on a Chip (SoC) variant that the company describes as follows: "Monarch SX integrates Sequans' Monarch, the world's first and most highly optimized LTE-M and NB-IoT platform, and first to be certified by a tier-one operator, with an ARMÂ® CortexÂ®-M4 processor, voice and audio engines with support for VoLTE on LTE-M, an always-on, ultra-low power sensor hub, and an advanced display controller to support a graphical user interface with touch screen functions." All the above is contained within a package that measures 90mm2, less than half the area of a US 1 cent piece as shown in the representation below. 

 The graphics components are provided by Think Silicon using its NEMA|dc line (probably the NEMA dc|400), which would yield a display resolution of 1920x1080. Given the size and capabilities of the device, the possibilities are enormous; essentially, any mobile device with a screen and moderate internet speed requirements comes into play. Probably, the most obvious use case is an LTE-enabled smartwatch (that isn't huge or need daily charging). Another significant opportunity is a low-cost VoLTE only phone for price sensitive emerging markets.
 Although the Monarch SX is not yet contributing to earnings, the company stated that the Monarch SX is "getting great traction" and appears to be a very compelling and market leading solution which is expected to begin ramping up in Q4 of 2017. Sequans Product Summary Sequans broadband chips are carrying the company at present and generate over 75% of their revenue. Despite this narrow product line, Sequans delivered 40% YoY growth in 2016 and expects to do so again in 2017. With its LTE Cat 1 (Calliope) moving into "full production" and the revenue ramp for LTE Cat M1 (Monarch) expected to start in Q4, the multi-year growth potential for Sequans looks very strong. An investment in Sequans is a bet on the ongoing supremacy of LTE. But why should LTE be dominant in the Internet of Things? We will answer that next. Part 3 - Why LTE? LTE is not the only way to connect to the internet, there are many other methods that must be considered before crowning a winner. There are many short-range solutions with a maximum range of less than 100 meters, common ones are Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC, Zigbee, and Z-Wave. These have their uses, but given the range limitations, none of them are truly mobile. Even within a home that has an internet connection, there are many use cases where a direct connection between the device and the internet is required, such as utility metering, security systems, automotive diagnostics or fire alarms. Many devices use 2G and 3G to connect to the Internet, but these technologies are already in decline. 2G has been sunsetted by AT&T (Verizon and T-Mobile have dates) and 3G will follow in a few years to free additional spectrum, besides both methods are too power hungry and inferior to LTE. Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) Unless you are in the tech world, LPWAN is probably an addition to your lexicon. The Wikipedia definition for LPWAN reads as follows: "Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) or Low-Power Network (LPN) is a type of wireless telecommunication wide area network designed to allow long range communications at a low bit rate among things (connected objects), such as sensors operated on a battery."
 In fact, this technology has been around for over 10 years and has generated a multitude of competing solutions outside of the cellular realm.  LoRa Sigfox Ingenu Symphony Weightless  All these technologies use public spectrum to transmit\receive radio signals with remote devices that can be miles away from the central receiver. Data speeds are low, ranging from 1Kbps to 20Kbps in practical situations. Network coverage of these solutions is very spotty, even the better ones Sigfox, LoRa (via Senetco), and Ingenu have very limited US coverage vs. Verizon's LTE network, or AT&T or T-Mobile for that matter. LPWAN technologies certainly have their use cases, but if a device is truly mobile (city to city) or requires a moderate data connection, then these options are immediately ruled out. Where they are well suited is low bandwidth stationary solutions like metering or switching, or limited mobility solutions such as agriculture. LTE Cat M1 is the smallest, fastest, most mobile and geographically available solution. Other LPWAN technologies reportedly have an advantage in data pricing, but the network availability is severely limited in most parts of the world. With the LTE network (including Cat M1) already in place nationwide on Verizon\AT&T (NB IoT coming), it will be a very challenging environment for these alternate technologies to make further headway in the US. If there are headwinds to LTE-M in the US, it most likely lies in the business model that carriers adopt for these devices. AT&T and Verizon both have pricing based on a per month basis which adds complexity to the purchasing decision and slows adoption. Once LTE-M devices are offered including lifetime data the final barrier will be removed. So, LTE looks like it's a winner in most scenarios. But why buy Sequans? There must be a ton of companies making single mode LTE chips. As far as I am aware, Sequans only has two competitors in this niche. LTE Competitors When I first found Sequans last September, I was very impressed by the achievements and foresight of this small French company with respect to recognizing and carving out the single mode LTE niche ahead of its much larger competitors like Qualcomm and Intel. After researching the single mode LTE market more closely, Sequans became an even more attractive option given the limited nature of public competitors and the company's first mover advantage.
 Qualcomm Qualcomm is an $80 billion-dollar behemoth that has dominated the cellular market for years and is currently being sued by the FTC for anti-competitive behavior. Trying to get a 100% return on your investment here is going to be tough. Qualcomm does have an LTE Cat M1 chip (MDM9206) but is trailing Sequans in a variety of ways. See prior article for details. Sony Entertainment (NYSE:SNE) Sony is a bit smaller at a market cap of $45 billion but still too big to get a double just on the strength of LTE. Sony acquired Altair (an Israeli company) in January of 2016. Sony also has an LTE Cat M1 chip (ALT1250) that was introduced in February of 2017 and is certified on AT&T but not Verizon. [Author Update: 05/24/2017] Intel Corp. Most of Intel's focus is on the fast end of the LTE spectrum however they did announce two IoT LTE chips on February 22nd of 2016, 6 days after the Sequans announcement. The first is the XMM 7115 which supports NB IoT only. The second is the XMM 7315 which is Cat M and also includes an application processor. You won't find information on either of these on the Intel website because neither one is commercially available nor has the company made any statement regarding certification on either Verizon or AT&T. While definitely a serious competitor, they appear to be lagging Sequans in getting to market and carrier certifications. With a market cap of $170 billion, single mode LTE is not going to be the decisive factor in the long term direction of the stock price. ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) ARM Holdings made two acquisitions in February of 2017 with the intent of incorporating IoT capabilities into their ARM chips. Initially they only plan to support NB IoT and not Cat 1 or Cat M1 which reduces the competitive frontage with Sequans. They are off to a late start with commercial shipment of product not expected until the second half of 2018. ARM Holdings was acquired by Softbank in 2016 for $32 billion so is not an option for direct investment. Nordic Semiconductor (Listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange)
 Nordic announced the nRF91 in July of 2016 and the chip will eventually support Cat M1 and Cat M2. Fortunately for Sequans investors the chip is not expected to sample until the second half of 2017 and won't be commercially available until sometime in 2018. Without any apparent lead with time to market or carrier certifications etc this does not appear to be well positioned. Sequans Sequans invented the category of single mode LTE and has led the competition in getting Cat 1 and Cat M1 chips to the market and network certified. It has built a strong ecosystem of development resources and module makers that assures it a solid place in the future of LTE. Sequans has a market cap around $300 million and only makes single mode LTE chips, making it perfectly positioned for growth in this market. Part 4 - Why Sequans? There are many reasons I like Sequans which you can read in my prior articles here and here. In this section, I focus solely on the immediate growth prospects for 2017 and some likely scenarios for 2018. Guidance and Growth I have been following Sequans closely for the last nine months and have been reassured by the accuracy of management's revenue guidance during that time. Here is a quick refresher of guidance vs. actual over the last year.   Quarter Guidance (millions)  Actual (millions)    2017 Q2 $13.5 - $15.5 ?? ($14.5*)   2017 Q1 $11.5 - $13.5 $12.4   2016 Q4 $13 - $15 $14   2016 Q3 $11.5 - $13.5 $12.5   * Midpoint of Sequans Q2 guidance Management's guidance has been spot on for the past three quarters, so it gives me some confidence in its Q2 guidance. This is what Georges Karam [CEO] had to say in the Q1 earnings call. "If we assume the midpoint of our guidance for the second quarter, the first half of 2017 will be up 40% over the first half of 2016. We feel good about the second-half of the year, so we continue to believe we are on track to grow more than 40% in 2017, with further acceleration in 2018." As we now know, its Cat 1 product has entered full production and the Monarch ramp should start in Q4, so these statements seem to correlate to the ramp in product shipment. The statement "With further acceleration into 2018" is certainly intriguing. The table below shows revenue estimates for Sequans at different growth rates through the end of 2018.
 

 Although 2018 growth rates of 75% to 100% may seem overly optimistic, the 2017 quarterly revenues are only in the $12-20 million range, so this is not unreasonable when viewed in absolute dollar terms. In addition, the average revenue forecast by analysts listed on Yahoo (as shown below) is $65.4 million for 2017 and $110.5 million for 2018. These numbers represent revenue growth of 43% in 2017 and 69% in 2018. 

 With breakeven expected at around $20 million per quarter and gross margins of 45%, Sequans should be generating substantial EBITDA in 2018. No one knows what will happen in 2018, but Sequans has laid the groundwork and has the ecosystem in place to garner its fair share of success. With its low quarterly revenues and the potential to sell tens of millions of LTE chips in all kinds of devices, its growth could be explosive. What value the market places on Sequans over the next year is impossible to say, but high growth companies in a hot sector always demand (and get) a very significant premium. Just today (5/22/17) the price target by Benchmark Co. was raised 42.5% from $4.00 to $5.70, making it the highest price target among the analysts that follow Sequans. Summary Sequans is the purest play on LTE and mobile IoT connectivity that exists today. Should you invest? Well, ask yourself these questions:  Do you believe the Internet of Things is becoming reality? Will LTE continue its ascent to global dominance in communications? Do you believe that single mode LTE offers the most compelling solution for connecting mobile and disparate low bandwidth devices to the internet? Can Sequans capture a reasonable share of the IoT LTE market? 
 If the answer is yes, then taking a position in Sequans is a smart way to play the IoT boom. The question is not whether Sequans can maybe double (because it already has in the past six months) but will it break the $10 mark in 2017 or 2018. I closed out my second article on Sequans (1/11/17) with this statement:    "Sequans represents the confluence of five factors that make this a very rare investment opportunity.  A micro-cap undervalued company. A well-defined, huge and imminent market. Best in class products. Partnerships with key industry leaders. A management team that is executing well.  I believe investors with the foresight to buy Sequans and the patience to wait 12 months or more will be very well rewarded for doing so."  This statement holds as true now as it did when it was first written, and I remain very bullish on the prospects for Sequans in 2017 and beyond. Appendix There are a few other points about Sequans that I wanted to pass along but did not fit within the narrative of the main article, so I am including them here. A1 - Qualcomm Suit On January 17th, the US Federal Trade Commission filed suit against Qualcomm arguing that Qualcomm used its dominant market position to stifle competition. 

 As a leading producer of WiMAX chips in 2007, Sequans was certainly among those companies harmed by the actions of Qualcomm. On January 23rd, Sequans filed an article 102 complaint with the European Union Trade Commission against an "unknown" party. Article 102 of the EUTC deals with anti-trust matters and specifically Abuse of Dominant Position. I can't say conclusively that the "unknown" party is Qualcomm, but I would certainly take that bet. Whether this might lead to a windfall for Sequans remains to be seen, but an FTC victory over Qualcomm in this matter would certainly bring it considerably closer.
 On May 12th, 2017, Samsung and Intel filed Amicus briefs in support of the FTC case and detailing how Samsung and Intel had been harmed by Qualcomm's business practices. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also suing Qualcomm and withholding royalties, with Apple claiming that Qualcomm has never offered FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms, as it is required to do by law, for the licensing of Qualcomm's essential IP. These lawsuits will probably take years to go through the courts, and Sequans may never see any financial benefit. However, with a rift forming between Apple/Intel/Samsung and their key LTE supplier, it spells opportunity for Sequans when those manufacturers look for suppliers of Cat 1 and Cat M1 LTE chips. Thanks to Seeking Alpha frmrVZguy for pointing out the Sequans 102 complaint. A2 - Recent LTE Network Developments On May 17th, 2017, Sprint announced that it would support LTE Cat 1 by the end of July 2017 and would begin deploying LTE Cat M by mid-2018. On May 18th, 2017, AT&T announced that it had completed deployment of its nationwide LTE-M (Cat M1) and that it would expand its LTE-M footprint across Mexico by the end of 2017. Monthly plans for LTE-M devices would start as low as $1.50 with discounts for volume or term commitments. Sequans stated during its Q1 earnings call that it expected its Monarch chip to be AT&T certified by the end of June 2017. Verizon and AT&T deploying LTE-M ahead of schedule is as good a sign as you will ever get that the IoT is finally going to happen.

History[edit]
Sequans Communications was founded in October 2003 by Georges Karam. He had previously worked at Alcatel-Lucent, SAGEM, and Philips before helping found Pacific Broadband Communications in 2000. He joined Juniper Networks in 2001 when the company acquired Pacific Broadband Communications and served as Juniper Network's Vice President of Engineering and General Manager for Europe until leaving the firm to found Sequans.[7][8]
In 2006, Sequans raised $24 million in venture capital in a funding round that was led by Kennet Venture Partners. It closed another funding round led by Reliance Venture that was joined by Alcatel-Lucent, Motorola, SAGEM, and others in 2007.[9][10]
Sequans was originally focused on the WiMAX chipset market and had more than seven WiMAX chips on the market by 2008. It expanded to the LTE market in 2009. Sequans was listed by the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SQNS in April 2011. A few months later, in September, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology approved Sequans' LTE technology for use in the country.[1][4][11] The company released its first LTE chipset to market in 2012.[1][12]
One of Sequans' SteamrichLTE chips was certified by Verizon Wireless for use in devices on its LTE network in January 2013. In February, Sequans was ranked the third overall LTE Baseband Supplier by ABI Researchand the company released its EZLinkLTE modules in May of that year. The EZLinkLTE modules, one of the first to support LTE bands 4 and 13, were built on the Sequans Mont Blanc chip that was previously certified by Verizon. In October 2013, two of the company's EZLinkLTE modules were certified by Verizon Wireless for use in tablets and mobile computers that run on Verizon's LTE network.[13][14][15][16]
In January 2014, Sequans was one of two LTE chipmakers to provide technology to Verizon for its LTE Multicast demonstration at the 2014 Super Bowl.That same month Sequans' EZLinkLTE module was selected by KD Interactive to provide LTE connectivity to its Kurio 7 4G LTE Android tablet. In April, China Telecom announced that its LTE-only modems would include Sequans' single-mode TD-LTE CPE units. The company's EZlinkLTE module was selected for Best Buy's first LTE Insignia tablet in November 2014.[17][18][19]
In February 2016, the company partnered with Verizon to enhance LTE Cat-M development and announced the Monarch chip, a Cat-M1 and Cat-NB1 3GPP LTE Release 13 Advanced Pro compliant platform.[20][21] Sequans Calliope Cat-1 LTE chipset was certified for use on NTT DoCoMo's network in March 2016.[22] The same chipset was certified by Verizon to support its Voice-over-LTE applications in April 2016.[23] In May 2016, the European Aviation Network selected the Sequans' LTE chipset to provide European aircraft with onboard internet access to passengers.[24] That same month, the company's EZLink LTE module was certified for use on AT&T's 4G LTE network.[25]
In September 2016, Sequans demonstrated their Monarch LTE Cat M1/NB1 chip at the CTIA's trade show in Las Vegas.[26] Link Labs announced that it would use Sequans Monarch chipsets in its modules for cellular networks in October 2016.[27] In November 2016, Verizon conducted the first over-the-air data call using a Sequans Cat-M1 chip in a prototype.[28] That same month, Gemalto partnered with Sequans to produce a Cat-M1 IoT solution,[29] and the company's Monarch chipset was used by NimbeLink in its Cat-M1 embedded cellular modem.[30] In January 2017, Gemalto debuted the EMS31 LTE Cat M1 module baed on Sequans Monarch chip and NimbeLink, LinkLabs, and Encore Networks announced that their LTE CAT M1 devices based on Sequans' Monarch chips were certified by Verizon Wireless.[31][32]

History[edit]
Sequans Communications was founded in October 2003 by Georges Karam. He had previously worked at Alcatel-Lucent, SAGEM, and Philips before helping found Pacific Broadband Communications in 2000. He joined Juniper Networks in 2001 when the company acquired Pacific Broadband Communications and served as Juniper Network's Vice President of Engineering and General Manager for Europe until leaving the firm to found Sequans.[7][8]
In 2006, Sequans raised $24 million in venture capital in a funding round that was led by Kennet Venture Partners. It closed another funding round led by Reliance Venture that was joined by Alcatel-Lucent, Motorola, SAGEM, and others in 2007.[9][10]
Sequans was originally focused on the WiMAX chipset market and had more than seven WiMAX chips on the market by 2008. It expanded to the LTE market in 2009. Sequans was listed by the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SQNS in April 2011. A few months later, in September, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology approved Sequans' LTE technology for use in the country.[1][4][11] The company released its first LTE chipset to market in 2012.[1][12]
One of Sequans' SteamrichLTE chips was certified by Verizon Wireless for use in devices on its LTE network in January 2013. In February, Sequans was ranked the third overall LTE Baseband Supplier by ABI Researchand the company released its EZLinkLTE modules in May of that year. The EZLinkLTE modules, one of the first to support LTE bands 4 and 13, were built on the Sequans Mont Blanc chip that was previously certified by Verizon. In October 2013, two of the company's EZLinkLTE modules were certified by Verizon Wireless for use in tablets and mobile computers that run on Verizon's LTE network.[13][14][15][16]
In January 2014, Sequans was one of two LTE chipmakers to provide technology to Verizon for its LTE Multicast demonstration at the 2014 Super Bowl.That same month Sequans' EZLinkLTE module was selected by KD Interactive to provide LTE connectivity to its Kurio 7 4G LTE Android tablet. In April, China Telecom announced that its LTE-only modems would include Sequans' single-mode TD-LTE CPE units. The company's EZlinkLTE module was selected for Best Buy's first LTE Insignia tablet in November 2014.[17][18][19]
In February 2016, the company partnered with Verizon to enhance LTE Cat-M development and announced the Monarch chip, a Cat-M1 and Cat-NB1 3GPP LTE Release 13 Advanced Pro compliant platform.[20][21] Sequans Calliope Cat-1 LTE chipset was certified for use on NTT DoCoMo's network in March 2016.[22] The same chipset was certified by Verizon to support its Voice-over-LTE applications in April 2016.[23] In May 2016, the European Aviation Network selected the Sequans' LTE chipset to provide European aircraft with onboard internet access to passengers.[24] That same month, the company's EZLink LTE module was certified for use on AT&T's 4G LTE network.[25]
In September 2016, Sequans demonstrated their Monarch LTE Cat M1/NB1 chip at the CTIA's trade show in Las Vegas.[26] Link Labs announced that it would use Sequans Monarch chipsets in its modules for cellular networks in October 2016.[27] In November 2016, Verizon conducted the first over-the-air data call using a Sequans Cat-M1 chip in a prototype.[28] That same month, Gemalto partnered with Sequans to produce a Cat-M1 IoT solution,[29] and the company's Monarch chipset was used by NimbeLink in its Cat-M1 embedded cellular modem.[30] In January 2017, Gemalto debuted the EMS31 LTE Cat M1 module baed on Sequans Monarch chip and NimbeLink, LinkLabs, and Encore Networks announced that their LTE CAT M1 devices based on Sequans' Monarch chips were certified by Verizon Wireless.[31][32]

History[edit]
Sequans Communications was founded in October 2003 by Georges Karam. He had previously worked at Alcatel-Lucent, SAGEM, and Philips before helping found Pacific Broadband Communications in 2000. He joined Juniper Networks in 2001 when the company acquired Pacific Broadband Communications and served as Juniper Network's Vice President of Engineering and General Manager for Europe until leaving the firm to found Sequans.[7][8]
In 2006, Sequans raised $24 million in venture capital in a funding round that was led by Kennet Venture Partners. It closed another funding round led by Reliance Venture that was joined by Alcatel-Lucent, Motorola, SAGEM, and others in 2007.[9][10]
Sequans was originally focused on the WiMAX chipset market and had more than seven WiMAX chips on the market by 2008. It expanded to the LTE market in 2009. Sequans was listed by the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SQNS in April 2011. A few months later, in September, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology approved Sequans' LTE technology for use in the country.[1][4][11] The company released its first LTE chipset to market in 2012.[1][12]
One of Sequans' SteamrichLTE chips was certified by Verizon Wireless for use in devices on its LTE network in January 2013. In February, Sequans was ranked the third overall LTE Baseband Supplier by ABI Researchand the company released its EZLinkLTE modules in May of that year. The EZLinkLTE modules, one of the first to support LTE bands 4 and 13, were built on the Sequans Mont Blanc chip that was previously certified by Verizon. In October 2013, two of the company's EZLinkLTE modules were certified by Verizon Wireless for use in tablets and mobile computers that run on Verizon's LTE network.[13][14][15][16]
In January 2014, Sequans was one of two LTE chipmakers to provide technology to Verizon for its LTE Multicast demonstration at the 2014 Super Bowl.That same month Sequans' EZLinkLTE module was selected by KD Interactive to provide LTE connectivity to its Kurio 7 4G LTE Android tablet. In April, China Telecom announced that its LTE-only modems would include Sequans' single-mode TD-LTE CPE units. The company's EZlinkLTE module was selected for Best Buy's first LTE Insignia tablet in November 2014.[17][18][19]
In February 2016, the company partnered with Verizon to enhance LTE Cat-M development and announced the Monarch chip, a Cat-M1 and Cat-NB1 3GPP LTE Release 13 Advanced Pro compliant platform.[20][21] Sequans Calliope Cat-1 LTE chipset was certified for use on NTT DoCoMo's network in March 2016.[22] The same chipset was certified by Verizon to support its Voice-over-LTE applications in April 2016.[23] In May 2016, the European Aviation Network selected the Sequans' LTE chipset to provide European aircraft with onboard internet access to passengers.[24] That same month, the company's EZLink LTE module was certified for use on AT&T's 4G LTE network.[25]
In September 2016, Sequans demonstrated their Monarch LTE Cat M1/NB1 chip at the CTIA's trade show in Las Vegas.[26] Link Labs announced that it would use Sequans Monarch chipsets in its modules for cellular networks in October 2016.[27] In November 2016, Verizon conducted the first over-the-air data call using a Sequans Cat-M1 chip in a prototype.[28] That same month, Gemalto partnered with Sequans to produce a Cat-M1 IoT solution,[29] and the company's Monarch chipset was used by NimbeLink in its Cat-M1 embedded cellular modem.[30] In January 2017, Gemalto debuted the EMS31 LTE Cat M1 module baed on Sequans Monarch chip and NimbeLink, LinkLabs, and Encore Networks announced that their LTE CAT M1 devices based on Sequans' Monarch chips were certified by Verizon Wireless.[31][32]

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Sequans Communications S.A. (NYSE:SQNS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $4.90 (36.87% upside)

History[edit]
Sequans Communications was founded in October 2003 by Georges Karam. He had previously worked at Alcatel-Lucent, SAGEM, and Philips before helping found Pacific Broadband Communications in 2000. He joined Juniper Networks in 2001 when the company acquired Pacific Broadband Communications and served as Juniper Network's Vice President of Engineering and General Manager for Europe until leaving the firm to found Sequans.[7][8]
In 2006, Sequans raised $24 million in venture capital in a funding round that was led by Kennet Venture Partners. It closed another funding round led by Reliance Venture that was joined by Alcatel-Lucent, Motorola, SAGEM, and others in 2007.[9][10]
Sequans was originally focused on the WiMAX chipset market and had more than seven WiMAX chips on the market by 2008. It expanded to the LTE market in 2009. Sequans was listed by the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SQNS in April 2011. A few months later, in September, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology approved Sequans' LTE technology for use in the country.[1][4][11] The company released its first LTE chipset to market in 2012.[1][12]
One of Sequans' SteamrichLTE chips was certified by Verizon Wireless for use in devices on its LTE network in January 2013. In February, Sequans was ranked the third overall LTE Baseband Supplier by ABI Researchand the company released its EZLinkLTE modules in May of that year. The EZLinkLTE modules, one of the first to support LTE bands 4 and 13, were built on the Sequans Mont Blanc chip that was previously certified by Verizon. In October 2013, two of the company's EZLinkLTE modules were certified by Verizon Wireless for use in tablets and mobile computers that run on Verizon's LTE network.[13][14][15][16]
In January 2014, Sequans was one of two LTE chipmakers to provide technology to Verizon for its LTE Multicast demonstration at the 2014 Super Bowl.That same month Sequans' EZLinkLTE module was selected by KD Interactive to provide LTE connectivity to its Kurio 7 4G LTE Android tablet. In April, China Telecom announced that its LTE-only modems would include Sequans' single-mode TD-LTE CPE units. The company's EZlinkLTE module was selected for Best Buy's first LTE Insignia tablet in November 2014.[17][18][19]
In February 2016, the company partnered with Verizon to enhance LTE Cat-M development and announced the Monarch chip, a Cat-M1 and Cat-NB1 3GPP LTE Release 13 Advanced Pro compliant platform.[20][21] Sequans Calliope Cat-1 LTE chipset was certified for use on NTT DoCoMo's network in March 2016.[22] The same chipset was certified by Verizon to support its Voice-over-LTE applications in April 2016.[23] In May 2016, the European Aviation Network selected the Sequans' LTE chipset to provide European aircraft with onboard internet access to passengers.[24] That same month, the company's EZLink LTE module was certified for use on AT&T's 4G LTE network.[25]
In September 2016, Sequans demonstrated their Monarch LTE Cat M1/NB1 chip at the CTIA's trade show in Las Vegas.[26] Link Labs announced that it would use Sequans Monarch chipsets in its modules for cellular networks in October 2016.[27] In November 2016, Verizon conducted the first over-the-air data call using a Sequans Cat-M1 chip in a prototype.[28] That same month, Gemalto partnered with Sequans to produce a Cat-M1 IoT solution,[29] and the company's Monarch chipset was used by NimbeLink in its Cat-M1 embedded cellular modem.[30] In January 2017, Gemalto debuted the EMS31 LTE Cat M1 module baed on Sequans Monarch chip and NimbeLink, LinkLabs, and Encore Networks announced that their LTE CAT M1 devices based on Sequans' Monarch chips were certified by Verizon Wireless.[31][32]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

4G Network Migration & Coexistence Solutions

4Sight
Sequansâ 4G Network Migration and Coexistence Initiative for WiMAX and LTE Operators and Device Makers










4Sight streamlines the WiMAX to LTE network transition
Sequansâ 4Sight program provides advanced coexistence solutions for many of the technical and financial challenges faced by operators and their ecosystem partners in deploying 4G networks.
Download new white paper by Monica Paolini, President, Senza Fili Consulting:Â A Smooth Transition from WiMAX to LTE With Dual Mode Devices

4Sight Program Components

Integrated Sequans dual-4G broadband processor. Highly optimized for 4G mobile networks and devices, including smartphones, tablets, data cards, PCs, CE devices, machine-to-machine devices and more
Comprehensive dual-4G reference designs for a variety of device types
Complete dual-4G protocol stack and host software
Technology solutions that enable peaceful multi-radio coexistence and seamless handover in heterogeneous 4G networks
An ecosystem of partners and broad IOT maturity for both WiMAX and LTE, ensuring operator-ready devices
Roadmaps for both WiMAX and LTE that promise cost-effective, power efficient, fast time-to-market 4G products

4Sight Benefits All 4G Operators
4Sight eliminates the uncertainty of operators surrounding which technology to deploy â WiMAX or LTE.Â  For WiMAX operators, specifically, it offers a smooth transition plan for moving to LTE â a plan that allows them to continue to monetize their existing network infrastructure while planning to move seamlessly and cost-effectively to LTE at the point in time where the return on investment makes sense.Â  WiMAX operators can seed their market with LTE-ready devices, which can be certified once and deployed anywhere in the network. These devices can handover between WiMAX and LTE and between 3G and 4G by leveraging Sequans unique dual-standby platform solution, providing a seamless user experience in any location.
Operators who began with WiMAX and wish to continue with WiMAX as well as those deploying LTE alone will benefit from Sequansâ continuing roadmap innovation, cost improvements, 3G-4G and multi-4G interworking technology, and multi-radio coexistence solutions.
Benefits to Device Makers
4Sight simplifies the design of devices that will work in the complex multi-mode, multi-band network environment now emerging. Device makers will find a much shorter and easier path to creating compelling 4G products.
4Sight Highly Cost-Effective
Sequans is ideally equipped to offer 4Sight solutions to 4G operators and device makers in a way that is highly cost-effective.Â Sequans brings its combination of operator-proven WiMAX and LTE chipsets, the integration track record to deliver a dual-4G processor, the system design experience to solve real-world coexistence and multi-mode handover challenges, and the years of experience in deploying operator-certified 4G technology in high volume around the world.Â Sequans bundle these solutions very economically, preserving a positive business case for both operators and device makers.

SQN1210 
Mobile WiMAX System-on-Chip for Mobile Devices









  





The Highest Level of Integration Achieved in the WiMAX Industry
802.16e Enhanced Semiconductor Solution
Based on state of the art 65 nm technology and many years of Sequansâ proven field experience, the SQN1210 delivers baseband and triple-band RF in a single die â the highest level of integration yet achieved in the WiMAX industry â leading to unprecedented achievements in performance, power consumption, and size.
Applications
The SQN1210 delivers wireless broadband connectivity for fully mobile WiMAXÂ® applications and for portable, nomadic, and fixed applications. It is designed for the smallest of mobile devices, such as mobile handsets, smartphones, MIDs, portable hotspots, and netbooks, and is also perfectly suited for use in PCs through add-on datacards, such as USB dongles or ExpressCards, or directly embedded in PCI Express MiniCards or Half MiniCards.
Highlights

65 nm, single die, baseband and RF
10Ã10 package, includes SDRAM
Triple-band RF: 2.3-2.4, 2.5-2.7, 3.3-3.8 GHz
Dual independent channels downlink and uplink

Maximum likelihood MIMO decoder on the downlink
2 Tx with closed loop diversity on the uplink


TDD and FDD
4G-EZ ultra low power
High throughput > 40 Mbps
4G-EZ software suite includes 3G/4G handover technology
WiMAX Forum Certifiedâ¢

Key Benefits of SQN1210
Advanced MIMO âÂ mimoMAXâ¢
SQN1210 features mimoMAXâ¢, Sequansâ patent-pending, low-complexity MIMO algorithm for maximum likelihood performance on the downlink and 2Tx on the uplink for 2Tx diversity and optional full 2Ã2 uplink MIMO.
Dual Transmit Channels and Closed-Loop Diversity
SQN1210 implements dual independent transmit chains with the worldâs most advanced 2Tx closed-loop diversity (2T-CLD) algorithm, for significantly increased link budget, improved cell coverage, and superior mobile performance. 2T-CLD delivers diversity gains well beyond single Tx solutions and ensures the best diversity for any channel environment. These gains are achieved in a manner completely transparent to existing base stations.
Future-proof with True Uplink MIMO
Sequansâ 2Tx capability allows for the added performance gains provided by uplink MIMO via Matrix A for those base stations that support it. Only Sequans, as the only provider of 2Tx across its entire mobile station product line, can make this future-proof promise.
4G-EZ Low Power Consumption
In addition to the low power consumption enabled by its core 65nm architecture and mimoMAX technology, SQN1210 employs state-of-the-art power reduction techniques â 4G-EZ ultra low power technology â to further reduce power consumption. Special care has been put on minimizing power consumption in standby mode to further extend the battery life of embedded devices. Smart software algorithms optimize resource management for additional power reduction improvements.

These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Sequans undertakes no obligation to update these statements.Sequans expects revenue for the second quarter of 2017 to be in the range of $13.5 to $15.5 million with non-IFRS gross margin above 40%. Based on this revenue range and expected gross margin, non-IFRS net loss per diluted share/ADS is expected to be between ($0.05) and ($0.07) for the second quarter of 2017, based on approximately 75.1 million weighted average number of diluted shares/ADSs. Non-IFRS EPS guidance excludes the impact of stock based compensation, the non-cash fair-value and effective interest adjustments related to the convertible debt and other financings, and any other relevant non-cash or non-recurring expenses.Conference Call and WebcastSequans plans to conduct a teleconference and live webcast to discuss the financial results for the first quarter of 2017 today, May 2, 2017 at 8:00 a.m. EDT /14:00 CEST. To participate in the live call, analysts and investors should dial 800-230-1074 (or +1 651-291-5254 if outside the U.S.).

All statements other than present and historical facts and conditions contained in this release, including any statements regarding our future results of operations and financial positions, business strategy, plans and our objectives for future operations and potential strategic partnerships, are forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, SectionÂ 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and SectionÂ 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). These statements are only predictions and reflect our current beliefs and expectations with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risk and uncertainties and subject to change at any time. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual events or results may differ materially from those contained in the projections or forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein include, without limitation: (i) the contraction or lack of growth of markets in which we compete and in which our products are sold, (ii) unexpected increases in our expenses, including manufacturing expenses, (iii) our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall, (iv) delays or cancellations in spending by our customers, (v) unexpected average selling price reductions, (vi) the significant fluctuation to which our quarterly revenue and operating results are subject due to cyclicality in the wireless communications industry and transitions to new process technologies, (vii) our inability to anticipate the future market demands and future needs of our customers, (viii) our inability to achieve new design wins or for design wins to result in shipments of our products at levels and in the timeframes we currently expect, (ix) our inability to enter into and execute on strategic alliances, (x) the impact of natural disasters on our sourcing operations and supply chain, and (xi) other factors detailed in documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements in this release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Read MoreUse of Non-IFRS/non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, we disclose certain non-IFRS, or non-GAAP, financial measures. These measures exclude non-cash charges relating to stock-based compensation and the non-cash financial expense related to the convertible debt and its embedded derivative issued in April 2015 and April 2016. We believe that these measures can be useful to facilitate comparisons among different companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations in that the non-GAAP measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies. We seek to compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures in the table attached to this press release. We are not able to provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for forward-looking IFRS estimates for gross margin and net loss per diluted share without unreasonable efforts, because certain adjustments are not known until the end of the period. The impact of these adjustments could be significant to our actual IFRS results.About Sequans CommunicationsSequans Communications S.A.

SQN1220 features mimoMAX, Sequansâ patent-pending, low-complexity MIMO algorithm for maximum likelihood performance on the downlink and 2Tx on the uplink for 2Tx diversity and optional full 2Ã2 uplink MIMO.
Dual Transmit Channels and Closed-Loop Diversity
SQN1220 implements dual independent transmit chains with the worldâs most advanced 2Tx closed-loop diversity (2T-CLD) algorithm, for significantly increased link budget, improved cell coverage, and superior mobile performance. 2T-CLD delivers diversity gains well beyond single Tx solutions and ensures the best diversity for any channel environment. These gains are achieved in a manner completely transparent to existing base stations.
Future-proof with True Uplink MIMO
Sequansâ 2Tx capability allows for the added performance gains provided by uplink MIMO via Matrix A for those base stations that support it. Only Sequans, as the only provider of 2Tx across its entire mobile station product line, can make this future-proof promise.
4G-EZ Low Power ConsumptionÂ 
In addition to the low power consumption enabled by its core 65nm architecture and mimoMAX technology, SQN1220 employs state-of-the-art power reduction techniques, 4G-EZ ultra low power technology, to further reduce power consumption. Special care has been put on minimizing power consumption in standby mode to further extend the battery life of embedded devices. Smart software algorithms optimize resource management for additional power reduction improvements.
