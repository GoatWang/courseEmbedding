Our Own Offering. Our Own Product.
Paste and raise technology, right on your own site. Turning customers into investors.Well, here's proof. We're putting (y)our money where our mouth is.​
Invest


​Our MissionFundPaaS is driven to deliver the only one-stop crowdfunding solution that is simple to use, cost effective, and accessible to everyone. From Main Street investors in search of opportunity, to growing businesses needing operating capital, to financial services providers looking to better serve their customers, FundPaaS’ proprietary technology powers the building blocks of the crowdfunding marketplace.
 
​Don’t Just Invest in Crowdfunding.  Invest in the Infrastructure to Power Crowdfunding.Nearly a century and a half ago, thousands of entrepreneurial pioneers in search of opportunity and fortune set out to find gold in the American west. Some prospectors succeeded; many did not. But first, every one of them invested in the picks and shovels they’d need to realize their dream. Some of the most successful entrepreneurs of the era, though, were not prospectors at all. They were the visionaries with the foresight to see beyond the sparkle of gold - and folly of fool’s gold - to invest instead in the unmistakeable value of the tools that would actually power the gold rush -- picks, shovels, train tracks, even trains.  Long after the rush subsided, the value of this infrastructure remained, ultimately powering the westward expansion and the vibrant economies that sprouted up all the way to California.  If crowdfunding markets today are the next American gold rush, you can buy part of a crowdfunding portal builder or one portal host.  Or, with an eye toward lasting value creation, you could invest in the infrastructure — the picks and train tracks of today — that power those markets and will propel their growth.
