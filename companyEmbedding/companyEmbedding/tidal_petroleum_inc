PROCESSES
Drilling Cost
LeasesThe right to enter and drill on the property owner's land is accomplished by obtaining a lease.  The lease is subject to title search and proper recording in much the same way as real estate. Many times the bonus for a mineral lease exceeds the value of the property itself.  Between legal cost for title work and lease bonus wells see costs in excess of $1,000,000 for leasing alone.  Some leases with multiple mineral and land owners take several months if not years to negotiate and finalize.  Site PreparationMost times, a road must be built to the site.  Good roads are a necessity in order for trucks and heavy equipment to reach the well.   Once at the site, a level area is cleared about 2/3 the size of a football field.  Bulldozers, dump trucks, excavators, and road graders are typically used for this process.  General this process takes between 2 and 3 weeks, but if extensive road work is needed it can take much longer  Construction of roads and drilling site is a major cost factor which can easily exceed $400,000 per location.DrillingWhen the site is prepared, the drilling rig can be moved into position.  A rotary rig is the modern equipment used.  It is capable of drilling over 1,000 feet per day through use of a rotary bit driven by huge engines.  Fluid or air if forced under pressure down the center of the drill stem to clean out the hole continuously during drilling.  The drilling operation is a very complicated one requiring enormous amounts of planning and teamwork.  A modern drilling project can encompass the use of 30-40 different individual companies to fully complete the process.  Cost depend on the depth and complexity of the well.  Modern horizontal well drilling costs can easily exceed $4,000,000 just in the drilling phase.  Without drilling complications these wells generally take about 3 weeks for the drilling phase.  Rig Mobilization Moving a drilling rig is not a simple task.  Every time a well is drilling a drilling rig must be moved in and assembled.  The process normally takes 3-5 days.  After the well is drilled the rig must be cleaned and disassembled and moved off location.  Rig mobilization and assembly expenses vary depending on how far the rig must be transported, but generally run between $100,000 to $350,000.. Miscellaneous costsCosts outlines above are only some of the cost incurred preparing, drilling, completing and producing of an oil or gas well.  in total, this complete process will encompass 40-50 different individual contracting companies and hundreds of additional minor expenses.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/22/2009
            

                BBB has determined that Tidal Petroleum Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Tidal Petroleum Inc has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Tidal Petroleum Inc has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

About Us
Tidal Petroleum was formed in June 1990 to engage in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and gas reserves in Texas. Over the last 26 years, Tidal has been recognized as a top producer in several different counties in this region.We have concentrated our activities on the Gulf Coast in South Texas, which is home to some of the most prolific reserves in the United States. Tidal Petroleum operates with a ZERO debt structure, incorporating low overhead, low operating expenses and a streamlined management organization and is able to readily adapt to changing conditions in the petroleum industry.
Our focus leans toward deeper drilling programs containing horizontal laterals in order to decrease the risk of dry holes and increase longevity of production life. 3-D seismic surveys and state of the art fracturing technology are some of the everyday tools utilized by Tidal.To date, Tidal Petroleum has drilled over 150 wells spanning 23 counties in south Texas.  Through 2016 we have produced over 1.6 million barrels of oil and 7.6 billion cubic feet of gas, totaling 2.9 million BOE.  We have been focused exclusively on exploration and production of Eagle Ford Shale since 2009.We pride ourselves on personal attention and professionalism in dealing with our clients, contractors, land and mineral owners.  Our reputation has been impeccable over the last 26 years.  Tidal Petroleum sets itself apart from large corporate competitors by the relationships and open communication channels with its partners.Our experienced management team, combined with innumerable contacts and consultants is 100% responsible for the research, exploration, completion and production processes in their entirety.  Every well in Tidal Petroleum's history has been drilled, produced and operated by Tidal.  We have never packaged, promoted and flipped acreage in our company's history.  Our goal is to fully (and immediately) develop all acreage leased while preserving or improving the surface environment.  Tidal Petroleum's ability to turnkey a prospect from lease acquisition to production is a major asset.  Controlling all aspects of the oil and gas process along with zero debt, give us a huge advantage on our competitors.
