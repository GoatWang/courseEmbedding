Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Former ARTBA Chairman Charles F. Potts Receives George S. Bartlett Award
September 30, 2015 | Awards & Scholarship
 

Charles F. Potts, chairman of the board of Indianapolis-based Heritage Construction and Materials, is the 2014 recipient of the George S. Bartlett Award. Potts, ARTBA’s 2008 chairman, received the award Sept. 30 at the association’s national convention.
The Bartlett Award annually recognizes an individual who “has made an outstanding contribution to highway progress.”  It is co-sponsored by ARTBA, the American Association of State Highway & Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.
Potts’ career in the transportation construction industry spans more than 40 years. The Winston-Salem, North Carolina, native is a former CEO for Heritage Construction, former president of Ashland, Inc.’s highway construction contractor APAC, Inc., and held increasing positions of responsibility at the Florida Department of Transportation.
Potts is a recognized expert in the field of hot mixed asphalt materials and construction. He has spent many years advocating the national need for a long-term transportation program that boosts federal investment in highways, bridges and transit systems and that includes a coordinated, long-term strategy to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of goods.
Established in 1931, the George S. Bartlett award is named for the man regarded as the greatest single influence on the use of concrete roads. During his career, Bartlett was lauded by contemporaries in the concrete and highway industry for his energetic and innovative promotion of concrete roads. In 1909, he established experimental stretches of concrete working with the Wayne County Road Commission in Michigan – the birthplace of modern road construction – and the University Portland Cement Company.
The ARTBA convention continues here through Oct. 1.
