                          SOLUTIONS THAT EMPOWER PEOPLE WITH VISION LOSS                        


























H. K.											




One of the most handy uses of the Sendero GPS, is the business yellow pages. When I needed a basement repair company, I just searched for basement and found three businesses within ten miles. I was then able to call each of them and get estimates and information. Try that from directory assistance. 											



 
								  





Elizabeth Bowden											




The use of Braille Note takers revolutionized many aspects of my life, and brought Braille back in to my world in a new way. For myself, one of the most thrilling concepts about me and my BrailleNote is the idea that the Braille world, which I thought I had lost has come back alive, and will always be part of me, how I work, and who I am.  The BrailleNote allows me to be competitive, and still keep using Braille to eternity. I am looking forward to exploring many more uses I have still not touched upon for my BrailleNote.  Some day, should I need to get an iPhone; the good part will be that I’ll be able to use it with my BrailleNote.											



 
								  





Jessica Snyder											




I am thankful that the wireless internet process has been simplified and now such book formats as National Library Service digital books and Audible are recognized by this outstanding machine. With every new model of this impressive note taker the features I have come to rely on are only improved upon and the new features allow for even more accessibility to the ever changing technology of this day and age.   											



 
								  





Sarah Jevnikar	 											




As a math major in university, I have a volunteer record a peer's handwritten notes onto DAISY cd's, which I listen to on a DAISY reader from HumanWare. This allows me to bookmark important formulas or concepts to refer to later, and ensures I have access to all visual material (such as graphs) that I might miss in lecture. This resource is invaluable, and I'd be lost without it. 											



 
								  





Virginia Miller											




My student was a Braille reader, but a very slow one and we were supposed to increase his reading speed as one of his goals.     We started using the Braille Note to talk back and forth and then he was able to obtain a Braille Note with a Qwerty keyboard.  This gave him so much more independence when out in the community, as he could write a message, use the speech to talk to someone, and they could respond by typing a message on the standard keyboard, and he could read the Braille display.

CEO
tC
Teddy Cha

Teddy's career has been in leading high-growth, enterprise
        software product teams (Emissary.io, Clearwell, Signpost, GLG).
        He and Hai Po were classmates and good friends at MIT, although
        they never imagined they'd be starting a company together. But
        once they started learning about healthcare data they were
        hooked - a messy, giant data set in a messy, giant industry,
        with an opportunity to eliminate predictable sickness? They
        couldn't imagine a better use of their time or particular
        (peculiar?) mix of experiences. Teddy has previously interrupted
        his startup career with stints through Wall Street (Goldman
        Sachs), business school (UChicago) and strategy consulting
        (Bain), which were wonderfully educational and have reminded him
        to keep being an entrepreneur.






CTO
hS
Hai Po Sun

Hai Po has spent over 20 years working with ultra dense and
          messy data sets. He has managed high frequency data analysis
          (JP Morgan, Amaranth, Wachovia), trading, building and owning
          quant trading strategies/platforms, undergrad and masters
          degrees in Computer Science, minor in cryptography from MIT.
          He considers all Science to be Data Science, and AI should
          really be called Augmented Intelligence. His driving force is
          to help teams solve problems that people care deeply about.
          Hai Po is also passionate about mathematics education and is a
          founding officer for the PROMYS Foundation, which supports
          talented young mathematicians.

Job Evers

Job Evers-Meltzer has over ten years of experience in data
          analytics. He graduated from MIT with a degree in Mathematics
          with Computer Science. Before pulseData, Job spent four years
          at an EdTech startup building an analytics engine to record
          and process millions of student activities each day. He also
          has a finance background and has worked on trading strategies
          for both bonds and stocks. At pulseData, Job manages the
          team’s cloud infrastructure ensuring that each data pipeline
          is able to efficiently crunch through health records for
          millions of patients.






Product Manager

Ollie Fielding

Ollie is passionate about solving healthcare's greatest
        challenges. He started out at 16 working in the local hospital
        laboratory testing blood samples. Following a quick diversion to
        study at Cambridge University, he joined Rotamap where he helped
        design and shape medical scheduling systems from the ground up,
        establishing Rotamap as the UK's leading clinical scheduling
        tool. Ollie devised a series of KPI metrics and national
        benchmarking tools for hospital departments and has acted as an
        advisor to government medical bodies in the UK on productivity,
        service improvement and workforce intelligence. In his spare
        time Ollie also dabbles as a playwright, several of his works
        have received national tours in the UK.






Software Engineer

Christopher Kipers

Prior to joining pulseData, Chris worked at Google where he
          was the lead engineer for their patent similarity machine
          learning pipeline. Chris also partnered with his wife and
          Columbia University to create decision support system that
          makes medication recommendations for acute heart failure
          patients in the ICU. In his free time, Chris enjoys playing
          spike ball and long romantic walks in Riverside Park.






Data Scientist

Edward Lee

Ed has over 15 years experience developing predictive risk
          models in financial and tech industries. He was last at
          Samsung where he developed reinforcement-learning and online-learning
          models for mobile and logistics use cases. Prior to
          Samsung he was at Bank of America managing model-risk of
          investment models across Bank of America’s asset management
          businesses with assets under management in the hundreds of
          billions. Ed leads the analytics effort to develop 
          ‘augmented-intelligence’ in healthcare, to help patients and 
          healthcare organizations alike realize better health outcomes.

        industry.  Chris is a former Management Consultant with Bain &

Bioinformaticist
jS
Jung Hoon Son

Dr. Jung Hoon Son is a board-certified pathologist, trained
        at New York Presbyterian-Columbia University Medical Center and
        Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University. He
        has witnessed first-hand that healthcare in the U.S. has trended
        unfortunately towards neglecting the actual care of patients
        while also preventing care providers to do their jobs. As the
        Senior Bioinformaticist at pulseData, he brings his ceaseless
        yet pragmatic optimism (you will find him in positive spirits
        99.9% of the time) to apply his informatics skills and clinical
        experience to help reverse this trend with this talented and
        passionate team. He enjoys watching endless Frasier re-runs with
        his wife, hiking, and dogsitting any pug we can find.
