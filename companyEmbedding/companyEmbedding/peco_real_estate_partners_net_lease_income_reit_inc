W. P. Carey Inc. to Focus Exclusively on Net Lease Investing for its Balance Sheet

Fundraising Platform to Close; Company Remains Committed to Managing Existing Funds
2017 AFFO Guidance Range Affirmed




Jun 15, 2017, 4:16pm EDT






















NEW YORK, June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- W. P. Carey Inc. (NYSE: WPC), an internally-managed net lease real estate investment trust, announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a plan to exit all non-traded retail fundraising activities, in keeping with its long-term strategy of focusing exclusively on net lease investing for the Company's balance sheet.


W. P. Carey's management and Board of Directors believes this approach will create long-term value for shareholders by optimizing the Company's cost of capital and enhancing its ability to grow Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) through a combination of single-asset investments and portfolio acquisitions.
In conjunction with this decision, the Company will cease all non-traded retail fundraising activities carried out by its wholly-owned broker-dealer subsidiary, Carey Financial LLC, effective June 30, 2017. All existing Managed Programs will continue to be managed by the Company through to the end of their natural lifecycles.
By taking these actions and executing on its long-term strategy, the Company anticipates the following benefits:

Elimination of costs associated with its retail fundraising platform, while preserving recurring, stable income streams from the existing Managed Programs through to the end of their natural lifecycles; 

Increasingly stable and more predictable earnings as the contribution from variable structuring revenue further declines and earnings are ultimately derived entirely from long-term, recurring lease revenues generated by a high-quality, diversified portfolio of net lease assets; 

New net lease acquisition opportunities become exclusively available for the Company's balance sheet; 

Simplified disclosure and communication with the investment community; and 

Remains well-positioned to potentially acquire the net lease assets currently owned by the CPA® REITs, which it has acquired and managed on their behalf.
Management Commentary
Mark J. DeCesaris, W. P. Carey's Chief Executive Officer, said, "The Board and management team continually evaluate the Company's business strategy to maximize long-term value for our shareholders. We looked closely at the potential structures for new products such as CPA®:19 – Global, including the types of investments that would satisfy their liquidity and leverage needs, and the time and scale required for them to reach profitability. Our conclusion was that our shareholders would be better served by focusing on our core net lease investment expertise.
"Since our founding by Bill Carey more than 40 years ago, we have focused on delivering increasing income and sustainable long-term value to our investors. Over that time, our corporate structure, revenue composition and capital sources have changed significantly. The decision we are announcing today is an affirmation of the net lease business Bill began in 1973 and another step in our evolution. Our entire team is committed to delivering value to W. P. Carey's shareholders and all of the investors in the funds we manage."
AFFO Guidance
The Company does not expect this decision to impact its 2017 guidance range and in conjunction with this announcement is affirming that for the full year it expects to report AFFO of between $5.10 and $5.30 per diluted share, subject to previously disclosed assumptions.
Live Conference Call and Audio Webcast Scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time
The company will host a conference call and live audio webcast to discuss this announcement at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time today, details of which are provided below.
Live Conference Call and Webcast
Date/Time: Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:30 p.m. Eastern TimeCall-in Number: 1-877-465-1289 (US) or +1-201-689-8762 (international)Please dial in at least 10 minutes prior to the start time.Audio Webcast: www.wpcarey.com/061517Announcement

Nontraded REIT heavyweight W.P. Carey retreats from net-lease real estate
As spreads tighten, turning attention to lodging, self-storage and Europe






Jun 18, 2014 @ 11:31 am
By 
	Bruce Kelly























+ Zoom




      A nontraded REIT heavyweight, W.P. Carey Inc., is carefully backing away from the sector that has long been its forte — net-lease real estate — and is looking for opportunities in other sectors and other markets. While registered reps and advisers continue to sell the current net-lease-focused real estate investment trust managed by W.P. Carey, Corporate Property Associates 18, the company has no plans in the immediate future to launch its next net-lease REIT, CPA 19.The net-lease market is getting crowded and pricey, analysts said. As a result, W.P. Carey has become active in the lodging and self-storage sectors, as well as looking for opportunities in Europe.
				



“W.P. Carey management recognizes that there is a lot more competition in the net-lease space for assets,” said Paul Adornato, REIT analyst with BMO Capital Markets. “This means that buying assets to fill up a net-lease-focused fund may not be as attractive as in the past.”Under a triple-net lease, the tenant is responsible for paying all operating expenses, property taxes and insurance. In traditional property sectors, landlords bear the responsibility for most of those expenses. Net-lease real estate has been one of the most popular sectors for nontraded REITs since the credit crisis and real estate crash. As real estate value fell and interest rates hit historic lows, net-lease REITs offered investors steady returns and income in the form of 6% to 7% dividends. W.P. Carey nontraded REITs are sold by the leading independent broker-dealer networks in the country, including LPL Financial, Commonwealth Financial Network and Cetera Financial Group. The company converted from a publicly traded holding company to a REIT two years ago and currently has a market capitalization of $6.35 billion.W.P. Carey's nontraded REITs have boasted strong returns. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 15 CPA REITs have posted average annual returns of 7.17% to 18.81%. CPA 15, which merged with W.P. Carey in 2012, posted average annual returns of 9.58% over 10 years. The net-lease real estate sector has grown tremendously and accounted for 7% of the traded REIT index at the end of last year, according to a January report by Green Street Advisors. W.P. Carey is not the only REIT player backing away from the net-lease real estate market. American Realty Capital also is doing so — last summer it said it was no longer going to create and distribute nontraded net-lease REITs. That was a few months before a related traded REIT, American Realty Capital Properties Inc., said it was buying rival net-lease REIT, Cole Real Estate Investments Inc.  “A lot more capital is looking for net-lease assets,” Mr. Adornato said. “This has created what some investors see as somewhat of a bubble in the net-lease market.The threat of rising interest rates is also spooking some net-lease investors. “Net-lease properties have more bond-like characteristics than traditional property sectors,” according to a Green Street Advisors annual report from January. “In particular, net-lease investments are longer-duration assets compared to other real estate sectors due to long-term leases and flattish cash flows.” W.P. Carey has widened its range of nontraded REITs beyond the CPA brand. In 2010, it introduced nontraded REIT Carey Watermark Investors Inc., which focuses on buying lodging properties and hotels. Last week, the company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission for another such REIT, Carey Watermark Investors 2 Inc. Carey Watermark is gaining ground with financial advisers and clients. For the year through May, it had about $83 million in sales, and has raised $659 million in equity since its launch. “The halt in net-lease shows their investment discipline,” said Sheila McGrath, managing director with Evercore Partners, adding that the company remains open to net-lease investing because it could still do a follow up offering to CPA 18. “W.P. Carey is saying, 'We don't want to raise too much in net lease and we are considering other property types to add to the platform.' ” This is not the first time W.P. Carey has pulled back from the net-lease market. In 2007, company founder William Carey decided to stop selling nontraded net-lease REITs.“Bill Carey called it,” said Kevin Gannon, managing director with Robert A. Stanger & Co., an investment bank. “He said, 'I can't make the math work anymore. In the long term, people will thank me.' ”According to Stanger, W.P. Carey sold $550 million of nontraded REITs in 2006 (all of which were net lease), none the next year, and re-entered the market in 2008, raising $342 million in equity. The company's recent shift in sectors was a surprise, he said. “When Carey first said it was doing a hotel REIT, I scratched my head, but timing-wise it was brilliant.”“There is an evolution of our investment management strategy,” said Trevor Bond, W.P. Carey's chief executive, in a recent interview. “We've changed a lot in the past two years since we became a REIT. The evolution towards multiple products has been a long time in coming.”Along with hotels, the company is focusing on real estate opportunities in Europe and self-storage, he said. The company's expertise in those areas came from earlier transactions in the net-lease REITs, Mr. Bond said. “But it took us a while to learn how to swim outside the pool and we waited until we felt comfortable expanding the pool,” he said. W.P. Carey has been “active sellers” in the net-lease sector as properties have become more expensive, he said. “With respect to new opportunities, we've gotten better growth and better opportunities in Europe in the past couple of years. We have weighted things slightly more towards Europe. It's a big region, and there's a lot of corporate-owned real estate there. That's where the growth is. Bill was a big internationalist, and I've continued that trend.”
