Reviews
Refreshing WWII Perspectives with Individuality and PersonalityVerified Purchaser:Wow, this is fantastic and easy to read. My partner and I enjoy WWII movies, documentaries, and even cinema revolving around WWII. I find it can sometimes turn pretty dry and hard to feel human about, but this book blows me away. To have a glimpse into so many individual men's perspectives and hear the way they have told their stories to Randall make this a really impressive little goldmine for any war buff.Each story is like sitting at your father or grandfather's knee while he tells you a story about his time in the war. Each story has a voice of it's own that leaves you feeling touched by that one person's adventure. Some of them seem like they arrived in the nick of time, some made impacts in ways you don't learn about in school, or see in films. It was super refreshing to hear each man's report with the feeling that how you read it, is exactly how he would tell you sitting down and sharing a cup of coffee over.It would also be a great companion novel to have any students read alongside their history books to actually get the feeling and weight of being drafted, going to serve, how a solitary man felt in the big movement that was a war. It's an amazing feeling to be able to read these stories and feel the weight that was placed on the men called to act.A+ read, I would highly recommend this for anyone, and it's at a reading level that is crisp, clean, and refreshing without stripping the individuality and personality from each man's tale. I can read several chapters at a time, or just read one and ruminate on the humanity and clarity of vision it presents.Very well done, and thoughtful as well. I loved it.Verified Purchaser:These  individual stories are extremely interesting to read. The sacrifices the WWII veterans made are noteworthy and should be seen and understood by everyone. We would not enjoy the freedoms we have without them and their service to this nation. Each man tells his story and what he went through in his own words. These men need to be honored,and remembered for what they did. A great read.Verified Purchaser:This is an awesome book to read. I love history; especially if the story is about the wars fought by the US Citizens and about people from our local territory.

 Jungle Stories has now been published and is available on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and other fine retailers. Over the years I have interviewed hundreds of World War II veterans and captured their stories for posterity. The "Greatest Generation" is still one to be honored and their tales preserved. One individual in particular I focused on was Delmar Strunk, a veteran who served in the China-Burma-India Theater. Over the course of five years, Delmar and I worked to bring to light his service and compile his memoirs. This project led to a very special work and finally, it is completed.JUNGLE STORIES: From The Fields Of South Dakota To The Jungles Of Burma is available in Hardcover, Paperback and Ebook!Other forthcoming books will include the vast array of WWII interviews, stories, and memoirs compiled over many years. The "Americans At War" Trilogy, will offer insight into the European, Pacific, and CBI Theaters, as well as the crucial Home Front.Stay Tuned for further updates and release information!
