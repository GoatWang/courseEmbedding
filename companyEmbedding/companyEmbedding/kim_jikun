	Kim, Jikun 





	Mr. Jikun Kim is appointed as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Kim was granted an initial equity award pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement entered into in June 2016 in connection with his appointment as our Chief Financial Officer. In determining the appropriate value of this award, the Compensation Committee used its judgment and discretion, and considered the results of negotiations with Mr. Kim, the size of historical initial equity award grants made to other senior executives, the recommendations of Compensia, and the peer group compensation information described above. Mr. Kim’s initial equity award was structured as a “front loaded” two-year award. At this time, the Compensation Committee does not expect to make any additional equity awards to Mr. Kim in fiscal 2017 beyond the performance-based portion of his initial grant, as described below. Mr. Kim will be eligible to receive another regular annual equity grant based on our newly developed long term incentive compensation program starting in fiscal year 2018. We believe this “front loaded” award structure was critical in attracting Mr. Kim to join the Company, and provided him with an upfront meaningful equity incentive that links his interests to those of the Company’s shareholders.
