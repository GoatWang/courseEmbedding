Statements



A New Account Statement for Your Delaware Life Annuity
In October, Delaware Life introduced a new service support model for our annuity business. This change included moving account records to a new administrative system. As a result, the look and content of your quarterly variable annuity account statements will be changing, beginning with the year-end 2015 statement that will be mailed to you in January 2016. The new statement has been streamlined and includes what we believe is the essential information for understanding and managing your annuity.
To help you become familiar with your new statement and how to find more information online, please use these tools:








A Guide to Your New Delaware Life Annuity Statement



Frequently Asked Questions
I just received my quarterly statement. Why does it look different?
As you may know, Delaware Life recently introduced a new administrative support model for our annuity business. This new model included changes to our contact information, as well as our Account Access website and outgoing correspondence to our customers. Along with those changes, you will now see your Quarterly Statement information presented in a new format.

Will this be the way my statement looks in the future?
Although there is no time frame on the enhancements, we are actively working on building more content into our future variable annuity statements to enhance the information and details specific to your contract.

I used to be able to see my living benefit and death benefit details on my quarterly statement. Why is that no longer available?
We are actively working on building more content into our future statements. However, at this time, living benefit and death benefit information is not available on the statement.
Your living benefit and death benefit information is available on our Account Access site. If you have not already done so, please register on the Delaware Life Account Access site to view your account details. For immediate questions regarding your living benefit or death benefit, or for information you cannot locate on the Account Access site, please call one of our Customer Service representatives and they will be happy to assist you.

My statement used to list my beneficiary details. Where can I find this information?
You may log onto our Account Access website to access your beneficiary details. On the Account Access site, within the “People” tab, you will find all Primary and Contingent beneficiary information and percentages.

I used to get my rate of return on my statement. Why is it gone and how do I get that now?
As part of the new administrative support model for our annuity business, the personal rate of return is no longer available. Although we are unable to provide your personal rate of return, you may access your fund performance details on our Account Access website.

My year-end statement used to tell me what my Required Minimum Distribution value was, as well as my next year’s RMD amount. Where can I find that information?
As a result of changes to outgoing correspondence, this information will now be sent through a separate mailing that outlines your Required Minimum Distribution basis value and your current year’s RMD amount. This letter will be postmarked no later than January 31, 2016.

My previous statement provided me with my cost basis. Why can I not get it on this one?
Going forward we will not be displaying a breakdown of your cost basis on your quarterly statements. However, one of our Customer Service representatives will be happy to provide you with the cost basis for your non-qualified contract.

My transactions used to be broken out by subaccount, and now it is only showing the total transaction. Why?
By logging-on to the Delaware Life Account Access site, you will be able to view transaction detail at the sub account level by dollar amount. If you require additional information regarding a specific transaction, such as units purchased and sold, please call our Customer Service team.

I used to receive e-delivery of my statements. How do I re-establish e-delivery of my account statement?
E-Delivery will be offered and available to clients by the end of 2015, but you will have to re-elect this service once you’ve registered on the Account Access site. Until you do so, you will continue to receive mailed documents.
Financial Advisors must register for account access to receive their client statements.
You can log onto the Delaware Life Account Access site or we will be happy to assist you with registering your account today if you call our Customer Service team.

I rebalance my portfolio each quarter, why does the transaction history look different?
The values displayed are the net result of all money/units moved between all funds in order to rebalance to the original percentages you have allocated. In order to view each of the funds, and the corresponding dollar amounts moved between each, please log onto the Delaware Life Account Access site.

Your Annuity Contract is Secure and Unchanged
The terms, guarantees and values of your annuity contract remain unaffected, as does our commitment to you. Your contract is backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of Delaware Life Insurance Company, a leading U.S. provider of annuity and life insurance products. The Delaware Life group of companies is a financially strong, well-capitalized organization committed to serving our clients as prudent financial stewards, with more than 340,000 in-force annuity and life insurance policies representing approximately $36 billion in assets under management.1
1As of September 30, 2015.

Assured Income 7SM Fixed Index AnnuityAmericans are living longer than ever thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles. This is great news, but longer lifespans mean extra years in retirement. You may even spend more years in retirement than you have at work. You may need to plan for more financial resources to have the retirement lifestyle you envision.
 
Assured Income 7SM Fixed Index Annuity is a flexible and straightforward solution built to provide you with guaranteed lifetime income. Your annuity gives you the choice of simple crediting options to grow your money and competitive guaranteed income you can depend upon and plan around. Assured Income 7SM offers an excellent balance of predictable guaranteed income and competitive accumulation.
 
Key Benefits
Assured Income 7SM gives you sought-after guaranteed lifetime income and simple, attractive crediting options to grow your money.
 
Guaranteed Principal to Protect Your Retirement MoneyUnlike other retirement products, a fixed index annuity is not an investment in individual securities. So when the markets do poorly, your account is guaranteed to not drop in value. Both your investment and any interest it earns are protected from principal loss, by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company.1
 

1If you withdraw your assets, your principal may be reduced by withdrawal and surrender charges, rider fees and a market value adjustment.


Choice of Indexes and Crediting Methods to Suite Your NeedsStraightforward options to grow your savings:
 

S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time.
 
For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.
 

The Standard and Poor’s 500® (“S&P 500®”) is a product of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC or its affiliates (“SPDJI”) and has been licensed for use by Delaware Life Insurance Company (“Delaware Life”). Standard & Poor’s® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”); Dow Jones® is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (“Dow Jones”); and these trademarks have been licensed for use by SPDJI and sublicensed for certain purposes by Delaware Life. Assured Income 7SM is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by SPDJI, Dow Jones, S&P, their respective affiliates and none of such parties make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in such product(s) nor do they have any liability for any errors, omissions, or interruptions of the S&P 500®.


Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit with Fee Refund Feature
Assured Income 7SM comes with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit that provides income for the owner and spouse (if elected), even if the account (cash) value should go to zero. The benefit base will grow by a guaranteed 9% per year (roll-up bonus credit) for 10 years (roll-up bonus period) for an annual cost. The benefit base is the amount on which your lifetime income is calculated. The benefit base is not a cash or surrender value or death benefit and is not available as a lump sum. This feature means you’ll know what your lifetime income will be, so you can make plans with real information.
 
Fee Refund Feature
 
The guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit also includes a unique fee refund feature. After 10 years (or less if the annuity’s owner dies) 100% of rider fees paid (within the last 10 contract years) are eligible for a refund if:
 

Lifetime income is never started, and 
No withdrawals of any kind (including RMDs) are taken. 


Bailout Endorsement
Assured Income 7SM comes with a “bailout” provision, that provides full or partial withdrawals from the contract without a surrender charge or market value adjustment if, the renewal cap for the S&P 500® 1-year point-to-point strategy is below the bailout cap rate. A cap is the maximum interest your FIA can earn in a year. No allocation to the Index account is required to receive this bailout protection. This benefit is provided to the owner at no cost. See the disclosure statement for more details.

  
Delaware Life Insurance Company is authorized to transact business in all states except New York, as well as in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Choice of Indexes and Crediting Methods to Suit Your NeedsChoose from an unusual, well thought-out selection of investment options and crediting methods designed to meet your evolving needs and goals:
 

CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure between the CROCI Sectors Index, which invests in the 10 most undervalued stocks from each of the three most undervalued global industry sectors, and a cash component, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure across equities, gold, interest rates and cash based on their trailing nine month performance, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

 
You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time. For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.
 

This Product (the “Product”) is not sponsored, endorsed, managed, sold or promoted by Deutsche Bank AG (DB AG) or any subsidiary or affiliate of DB AG.  The Deutsche Bank Indices are the exclusive property of DB AG.  “Deutsche Bank” and “CROCI” are proprietary marks of DB AG and its affiliates that have been licensed for certain uses and purposes to Delaware Life Insurance Company (DLIC).  Neither DB AG, CROCI, nor any affiliate of DB AG, nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Deutsche Bank Indices: (1) is acting in a fiduciary or product management capacity or providing any endorsement of the Product or investment advice of any kind; (2) has any obligation to take the needs of DLIC, the sponsor of the Product, or its clients into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the Deutsche Bank Indices; (3) is responsible for or has participated in the determination of the timing of, prices at, quantities or valuation of the Product; (4) WARRANTS OR GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE DEUTSCHE BANK INDICES OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INTERRUPTIONS THEREIN OR THE ADMINISTRATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF THE PRODUCT.  The CROCI Indices have been built on the premise that the CROCI Economic P/E is an effective indicator of inherent value. This premise may not be correct, and prospective investors must form their own view of the CROCI methodology and evaluate whether CROCI is appropriate for them. Please see the Disclosure Statement and Annuity Illustration for more information about the Deutsche Bank Indices and the Product.
Obligations to make payments under the Product are solely the obligation of Delaware Life Insurance Company and are not the responsibility of DB AG.  The selection of one or more of the Deutsche Bank Indices as a crediting option under the Product does not obligate Delaware Life Insurance Company or DB AG to invest annuity payments in the components of any of the Deutsche Bank Indices.
The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee.
While volatility controls may result in less fluctuation in rates of return as compared to indices without volatility controls, they may also reduce the overall rate of return as compared to products not subject to volatility controls.

 

There are risks associated with the CROCI methodology, the CROCI Sectors III Index and the CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control (“CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC”) Index:

No assurance can be given that the CROCI methodology will be successful at identifying undervalued companies;
There is no assurance that (i) the three industry sectors chosen will outperform the other industry sectors or (ii) the 30 chosen stocks will outperform the remaining stocks in the component indices;
Even if the strategy of the CROCI Sectors III Index is successful and it outperforms the component indices, the level of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may decline;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to a maximum notional exposure of 100% to the CROCI Sectors III Index and will not adjust its exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index by more than 10% on any day, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may not be able to maintain a fixed target volatility level of 5.5%;
If the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors III Index is less than 5.5%, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may have a 100% exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index, but a target volatility level less than 5.5%;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC’s exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index on each day is calculated based on the historical realized volatility the CROCI Sectors III Index, the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC could differ significantly from the target volatility level;
The CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to currency exchange rate risk; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, may adjust the Index and/or its components in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.


 

There are risks associated with the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index (the “Index”) and the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator Index (the “Momentum Index”):

The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee;
On any day, the actual realized volatility of the Index could be significantly higher or lower than the target volatility of 5.5%;
There is no assurance that the strategy of the Momentum Index will be successful, and it may decline in value even if successful. Past performance of the Index is not indicative of future results; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, the Momentum Index and the Momentum Index’s underlying indices, may adjust such indices in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.


 

The Standard and Poor’s 500® (“S&P 500®”) is a product of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC or its affiliates (“SPDJI”) and has been licensed for use by Delaware Life Insurance Company (“Delaware Life”). Standard & Poor’s® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”); Dow Jones® is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (“Dow Jones”); and these trademarks have been licensed for use by SPDJI and sublicensed for certain purposes by Delaware Life.

Options for Lifetime IncomeTake your retirement income as you choose:
 

Free withdrawal amounts
Periodic withdrawals
Annuity payments
Guaranteed withdrawals with an optional, affordable Stacked Accumulation Income Rider® (STAIR®) provides guaranteed lifetime income for you and your spouse, even if your Account Value should go to zero.


Return of Premium RiderThe optional Return of Premium Rider is available for an additional fee. You may surrender at any time prior to the Annuity Date – without surrender charges – and receive at least 100% of the premiums you paid (minus applicable prior withdrawals).
Access to Indexes Sponsored By a Global LeaderAccess the indexes sponsored by a leading global provider of financial services when you choose the CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control Index and Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index. Founded in 1870 and headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Deutsche Bank is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in the world.

Bailout EndorsementRetirement Stages 7® comes with a “bailout” provision, which provides full or partial withdrawals from the contract without a surrender charge or market value adjustment if the renewal cap for the S&P 500® 1-year point-to-point strategy is below the bailout cap rate.

Even if the strategy of the CROCI Sectors III Index is successful and it outperforms the component indices, the level of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may decline;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to a maximum notional exposure of 100% to the CROCI Sectors III Index and will not adjust its exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index by more than 10% on any day, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may not be able to maintain a fixed target volatility level of 5.5%;
If the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors III Index is less than 5.5%, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may have a 100% exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index, but a target volatility level less than 5.5%;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC’s exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index on each day is calculated based on the historical realized volatility the CROCI Sectors III Index, the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC could differ significantly from the target volatility level; 
The CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to currency exchange rate risk; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, may adjust the Index and/or its components in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.



There are risks associated with the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index (the “Index”) and the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator Index (the “Momentum Index”):

In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee;
On any day, the actual realized volatility of the Index could be significantly higher or lower than the target volatility of 5.5%;
There is no assurance that the strategy of the Momentum Index will be successful, and it may decline in value even if successful. Past performance of the Index is not indicative of future results; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, the Momentum Index and the Momentum Index’s underlying indices, may adjust such indices in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.

Assured Income 7SM Fixed Index AnnuityAmericans are living longer than ever thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles. This is great news, but longer lifespans mean extra years in retirement. You may even spend more years in retirement than you have at work. You may need to plan for more financial resources to have the retirement lifestyle you envision.
 
Assured Income 7SM Fixed Index Annuity is a flexible and straightforward solution built to provide you with guaranteed lifetime income. Your annuity gives you the choice of simple crediting options to grow your money and competitive guaranteed income you can depend upon and plan around. Assured Income 7SM offers an excellent balance of predictable guaranteed income and competitive accumulation.
 
Key Benefits
Assured Income 7SM gives you sought-after guaranteed lifetime income and simple, attractive crediting options to grow your money.
 
Guaranteed Principal to Protect Your Retirement MoneyUnlike other retirement products, a fixed index annuity is not an investment in individual securities. So when the markets do poorly, your account is guaranteed to not drop in value. Both your investment and any interest it earns are protected from principal loss, by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company.1
 

1If you withdraw your assets, your principal may be reduced by withdrawal and surrender charges, rider fees and a market value adjustment.


Choice of Indexes and Crediting Methods to Suite Your NeedsStraightforward options to grow your savings:
 

S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time.
 
For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.

Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit with Fee Refund Feature
Assured Income 7SM comes with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit that provides income for the owner and spouse (if elected), even if the account (cash) value should go to zero. The benefit base will grow by a guaranteed 9% per year (roll-up bonus credit) for 10 years (roll-up bonus period) for an annual cost. The benefit base is the amount on which your lifetime income is calculated. The benefit base is not a cash or surrender value or death benefit and is not available as a lump sum. This feature means you’ll know what your lifetime income will be, so you can make plans with real information.
 
Fee Refund Feature
 
The guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit also includes a unique fee refund feature. After 10 years (or less if the annuity’s owner dies) 100% of rider fees paid (within the last 10 contract years) are eligible for a refund if:
 

Lifetime income is never started, and 
No withdrawals of any kind (including RMDs) are taken. 


Bailout Endorsement
Assured Income 7SM comes with a “bailout” provision, that provides full or partial withdrawals from the contract without a surrender charge or market value adjustment if, the renewal cap for the S&P 500® 1-year point-to-point strategy is below the bailout cap rate. A cap is the maximum interest your FIA can earn in a year. No allocation to the Index account is required to receive this bailout protection. This benefit is provided to the owner at no cost. See the disclosure statement for more details.

  
Delaware Life Insurance Company is authorized to transact business in all states except New York, as well as in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Obligations to make payments under the Product are solely the obligation of Delaware Life Insurance Company and are not the responsibility of DB AG.

While volatility controls may result in less fluctuation in rates of return as compared to indices without volatility controls, they may also reduce the overall rate of return as compared to products not subject to volatility controls.

CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure between the CROCI Sectors Index, which invests in the 10 most undervalued stocks from each of the three most undervalued global industry sectors, and a cash component, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure across equities, gold, interest rates and cash based on their trailing nine month performance, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time. For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.
 


This  Product (the “Product”) is not sponsored, endorsed, managed, sold or promoted by Deutsche Bank AG (DB AG) or any subsidiary or affiliate of DB AG.  The Deutsche Bank Indices are the exclusive property of DB AG.  “Deutsche Bank” and “CROCI” are proprietary marks of DB AG and its affiliates that have been licensed for certain uses and purposes to Delaware Life Insurance Company (DLIC).  Neither DB AG, CROCI, nor any affiliate of DB AG, nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Deutsche Bank Indices: (1) is acting in a fiduciary or product management capacity or providing any endorsement of the Product or investment advice of any kind; (2) has any obligation to take the needs of DLIC, the sponsor of the Product, or its clients into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the Deutsche Bank Indices; (3) is responsible for or has participated in the determination of the timing of, prices at, quantities or valuation of the Product; (4) WARRANTS OR GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE DEUTSCHE BANK INDICES OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INTERRUPTIONS THEREIN OR THE ADMINISTRATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF THE PRODUCT.  The CROCI Indices have been built on the premise that the CROCI Economic P/E is an effective indicator of inherent value. This premise may not be correct, and prospective investors must form their own view of the CROCI methodology and evaluate whether CROCI is appropriate for them. Please see the Disclosure Statement and Annuity Illustration for more information about the Deutsche Bank Indices and the Product.
Obligations to make payments under the Product are solely the obligation of Delaware Life Insurance Company and are not the responsibility of DB AG.  The selection of one or more of the Deutsche Bank Indices as a crediting option under the Product does not obligate Delaware Life Insurance Company or DB AG to invest annuity payments in the components of any of the Deutsche Bank Indices.
The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee.
While volatility controls may result in less fluctuation in rates of return as compared to indices without volatility controls, they may also reduce the overall rate of return as compared to products not subject to volatility controls.

 

There are risks associated with the CROCI methodology, the CROCI Sectors III Index and the CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control (“CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC”) Index:

No assurance can be given that the CROCI methodology will be successful at identifying undervalued companies;
There is no assurance that (i) the three industry sectors chosen will outperform the other industry sectors or (ii) the 30 chosen stocks will outperform the remaining stocks in the component indices;
Even if the strategy of the CROCI Sectors III Index is successful and it outperforms the component indices, the level of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may decline;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to a maximum notional exposure of 100% to the CROCI Sectors III Index and will not adjust its exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index by more than 10% on any day, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may not be able to maintain a fixed target volatility level of 5.5%;
If the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors III Index is less than 5.5%, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may have a 100% exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index, but a target volatility level less than 5.5%;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC’s exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index on each day is calculated based on the historical realized volatility the CROCI Sectors III Index, the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC could differ significantly from the target volatility level; 
The CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to currency exchange rate risk; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, may adjust the Index and/or its components in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.



There are risks associated with the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index (the “Index”) and the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator Index (the “Momentum Index”):

The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee;
On any day, the actual realized volatility of the Index could be significantly higher or lower than the target volatility of 5.5%;
There is no assurance that the strategy of the Momentum Index will be successful, and it may decline in value even if successful. Past performance of the Index is not indicative of future results; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, the Momentum Index and the Momentum Index’s underlying indices, may adjust such indices in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.
