About Us





John H. Murray & Son, Inc. has been serving the Greater Valley Area since 1890. In the beginning we delivered coal by horse and wagon.





In the 1920's we began delivering Fuel Oil, Kerosene and Diesel Fuel to area residents. 

In the 1950's a Service Department was added to provide our customers with new equipment, emergency services ,as well as, provide regular maintenance to keep equipment performing efficiently.

The latest from John H. Murray is we now sell Propane and can meet all your propane needs.




 The Company continually strives to serve the Greater Valley Area  with high value, high quality heating products, combined with superior service.

John kept his word and helped me secure a job as a fledgling salesman.  He put me under the leadership of a person who was a great and kind mentor and within a team of wonderful peers.  I owe it to John for helping me to build a career of over 30 years, where I met my wife and have found great friendships that have endured.  Indeed, I have great respect and am very grateful to John.  My family and I are very thankful and lucky, to say the least, to be a small part of the legacy of John Murray.  Godspeed,John, and God bless the entire Murray family.  Mark Mutchler

As a young salesman starting out with Bankers Box Co. in 1980, John was my first boss there, and taught me a lot about salesmanship and servicing customers. He not only was a terrific mentor, but a great guy as well. His customers both liked and respected him, as did I.  I'll always remember John's "unique" sense of humor, and deep pride in being a U.S. Marine. Bill Clark-Palatine,IL

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Sayre, PA professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Sayre, PA portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Sayre, PA professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Sayre

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							How to Locate Your Murray Model Number						



							If you’re reading this, you probably need some help finding the model number on your Murray product. Murray prints their model number on a sticker or etched plate. So you’ll want to start by trying to find that. If you've already found that, you’re ready to take your model number and start ordering parts. If not, check out some of our suggestions on finding the nameplate below:

If you have a Murray riding lawnmower, then look under the seat for the nameplate. 

If you have a walk-behind mower, check the mower’s deck, usually they place the nameplate in the center of it.

Our Customer Service team is always happy to help you search for your model number, so feel free to call us at (866) 802-6383 if you have trouble finding your tool’s information.







							Need a Hand with Your Murray Repair?						

							Our great relationship with Murray means that you’ll get the best quality OEM parts from our warehouse and the best expert advice from our technicians. So if you need a little help replacing the lawn mower blade on your Murray 30503x11A or repairing an auger shaft on a Murray 1694997, we have you covered with both a big stock of replacement parts and expert advice. 

We encourage visitors to browse our parts lists and Repair Forum to see what we can offer you. We’re confident that with our resources, we can help you through even the toughest situation.

					Yard Doctor				

					If you’ve ever owned a Murray product, you’ll understand why they  continue growing into one of the largest power equipment companies in the world. Simply put, their machines get the job done, no matter how tough it is. 

Their association with Briggs and Stratton makes their quality unmatched. So if you’re sick of spending hours shoveling snow or pushing a lawnmower, upgrade with a Murray and see why they are the choice for so many professionals.
