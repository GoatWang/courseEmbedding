Sonoran Systems, Inc. Launches the Sonoran Enterprise Management (SEM) Front Desk Product

							SEM Front Desk is built on and derived from Sonoran System's fifth generation carrier grade ArTrac G5 product line used in the wireless and telecommunications industries for decades. Front Desk has been rigorously tested and can be downloaded to the client's hardware. If the client prefers a turnkey solution Sonoran can include a Micro PC with the software pre-installed.

												Oct 1, 2015						
 


			South Daytona, Florida, 
			October 1, 2015			(Newswire.com) -
	Front Desk is offered in three versions - Standard, Advanced and Deluxe to provide each small to medium size business the feature set that fits their current organizational and business needs. As their business and needs grow they can easily change to a Front Desk version with additional features. SEM Front Desk is available for sale on the Sonoran web store www.SonoranMgt.com
 SEM Front Desk consolidates features that bring efficiency to all businesses by maintaining customer information, appointments and scheduling work using a rich outlook style calendar. Tickets can be triggered by the Scheduler module or created manually. The Ticketing module notifies correct resources of work assignments and the escalation engine keeps management apprised of the status of the assigned work. To manage inventory Front Desk also includes an optional Asset Management bar coding module that even supports multi-site operations. Front Desk inherits its modular, integrated feature set; distributed architecture; and scalability as well as SOX, HIPAA foundation and PCI compliance standards from its ArTrac G5 foundation. Best of all, every feature in SEM Front Desk is tightly and seamlessly integrated so you can focus on your business and not on trying to integrate systems from different vendors, leaving frustrating and costly gaps, inconsistencies, incompatibilities, and confusion in your tool sets. ​
