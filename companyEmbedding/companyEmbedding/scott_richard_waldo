Answer two quick questions to see how many TP tubes you'll eliminate by tossing the tube for good.

WHY TOSS THE TUBE FOR GOOD?
                                

Enough TP tubes are used each year to fill the Empire State Building, twice. With Scott® Tube-Free Toilet Paper, you can get premium softness without the wasteful tube.
