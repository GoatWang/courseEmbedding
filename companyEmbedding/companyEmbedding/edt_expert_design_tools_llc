            How it works
          



























Get your business online fast! Our best-in-class industry themes make it possible for your website to be online in days.
           























Monitor your site along the way with 24/7 access to your Design Manager. View designs, send files and leave feedback.
           



























Keep your site fresh without having to make changes yourself. With our Standard Website Design plan, we’ll make 6 hours of updates during the first 12 months. Our other plans offer site updates at an hourly rate.
           



















No hidden fees. You pay a one-time fee to build your site, a small monthly hosting fee and, if you choose to have us update your site after it’s launched, an
hourly design fee. Everything else is included, so there are no surprises.
















































































              Share your vision
            




Tell our staff about your business and products via a brief interview, online or over the phone.  
Choose from our selection of professionally designed, industry-specific themes. (Standard Website and WordPress Design plans)  
Use our online Design Manager to provide us with the images and words you want to use on your site.  
Questions along the way? Just pick up the phone or send us an email.









































































              We go to work
            




After selecting your theme, our expert designers create your new site based on your instructions.  

We add your text, images and logos (if you have them). Not sure what you want? No worries. We insert professional photos to make your site look sleek.  

We also add SEO (Search Engine Optimization) tags on every page to improve your site's visibility on popular search engines.  

Your site will be ready for you to review in as few as 7 business days after we receive your content.  

Once you've approved your site, we send it through our quality control process and it goes live for the world to see!




















































              Enhance and expand
            



             If you need to update the text or change the image on your site, just contact us. Our Standard Website Design plan includes 6 hours of update time. Or if you have our Simple Site or WordPress Design plans, we’ll make updates for a low hourly rate.
           










Your questions, our answers.        



How does the GoDaddy Web Design Service work?                    

Once you've selected the plan that's right for you, you'll choose a theme that fits your industry or occasion and give your personal web designer the basic information about your site.  

With a website from the Professional Web Services Team, you simply provide the content and images; we handle everything else. If you don't have any images, no problem. We can insert professional images that will fit your site perfectly.  

We build a website that fits your style, as well as your needs. And the best part is that it’ll be online in days, not months.




Can I give feedback on the web design as it's being built?                    

You bet! You can log in to our 24/7 Design Manager at any point and review the site as it stands currently. You can even leave feedback for your designer to help them build a website that you'll be proud to share with the world.                    



What about updating my website?                    

Once your site is published, we make it easy for you to update your site on your own. You can log in to your account and make minor website updates on the fly. If you need to make bigger changes, we’ve got that covered too.  

Our Standard Website Design plan includes 6 hours of update time, while our Simple Site and WordPress Design plans let you purchase updates as needed for a low hourly rate. Our designers can change text, swap out images, whatever you need them to do.




Why should I choose GoDaddy Website Design?                    

Website creation from GoDaddy's Professional Web Services team lets you rest easy knowing a modern, professionally designed website is just around the corner.  

You won't have to wait months to get it. We get your site up fast, as quickly as 7 business days, so you can get back to what really matters.  

And don't forget about our 24/7/365 support. Our website design services, like every GoDaddy product, are backed by our world-class customer service.




How do I get started after I purchase GoDaddy Web Design Services?                    

Simply give us a call or log in to the Design Manager and provide the details we need to get started on your site. Our streamlined process makes it easy.                    



How do I get my free domain?                    

Your GoDaddy consultant will help you choose your domain name during your free initial consultation. Domain must be selected at the same time as your website design purchase.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.
