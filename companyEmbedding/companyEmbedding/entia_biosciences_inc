Entia Biosciences, Inc. (OTCQB: ERGO) Enters Into Exclusive Worldwide Licensing Agreement For Its GROH Beauty Products Line






GlobeNewswire



Feb 24, 2017 4:01 PM EST













 


















































 PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 24, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Entia Biosciences, Inc. (OTCQB:ERGO) announced that it has licensed to GROH BEAUTY CORP of Deerfield Beach, Florida, the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture and distribute its proprietary GROH ® beauty care product line.  The license also has a companion agreement that provides for Entia to manufacture and supply its proprietary ErgoD2 ® product for use in GROH BEAUTY CORP's manufacture of the various products within the GROH product line.  Together, the license and its companion manufacturing agreement provide Entia with an upfront license fee, on-going royalties based on sales of products containing the ErgoD2 compound and sales revenue from supply of ErgoD2 to GROH BEAUTY CORP.  "We are very pleased to be working with GROH BEAUTY CORP, a new business unit of a proven, successful developer and marketer of beauty and cosmetic products," stated Carl J. Johnson, President and Chief Executive of Entia.  "We are confident that they will generate significant success with the GROH brand and look forward to the additional resources that this license will provide to us.  This is an alternative but superior approach for Entia to the beauty care market and will better contribute to building value for our shareholders than the Company's previous efforts in this area."  Entia's 2014 entry into the beauty care market did not achieve the success for which the then management had hoped.  Entia's new management has determined that beauty care is not an appropriate area of strategic focus for the Company, planning instead upon developing and profitably marketing clinically-proven health care products that are based upon the Company's novel and proprietary ErgoD2 technology in the nutritional supplement and/or medical food categories.  The Company is taking aggressive yet carefully planned steps toward that end.  Dr. Marvin Hausman, Chief Science & Technology Officer, indicated that Entia plans to introduce its first healthcare product before mid-2017.  The product will likely be introduced as a kidney health supplement.  Kidney health is a growing concern in the U.S. and around the world.  "The Company's research studies among individuals with compromised kidney function have been quite encouraging, if not downright exciting," noted Hausman.  "We are anxiously looking forward to the market rollout of the first of our new healthcare products."

Entia BioScience – 
























Entia BioScience 




Entia Biosciences, Inc.
Entia brings the credibility of biotechnology to the food science and supplementation markets.  Our growing portfolio of intellectual property currently spans some of the most powerful antioxidants and bio nutrients occurring in nature.  We are rapidly becoming a global leader in Nutrigenomics by identifying, scientifically validating, and commercializing solutions that address multi-billion dollar markets for organic health, beauty and agriculture.
Ergo (Ergothioneine)
Ergothioneine is a naturally occurring amino acid and is a thiourea derivative of histidine, containing a sulfur atom in the imidazole ring. This master antioxidant is made in rather few organisms, most notably mushrooms. Ergothioneine was discovered in 1909 and named after the ergot fungus from which it was first purified, with its structure being determined later, in 1911. This amino acid has high antioxidant properties, but its chemistry differs from conventional sulfur-containing antioxidants such as glutathione or lipoic acid.

D2 (Ergocalciferol)
Vitamin D is known as the sunshine vitamin because we get much of our Vitamin D from the sun. Over the last two decades, studies have found that the level of Vitamin D has dropped dramatically in Americans.  Vitamin D has become a very hot topic in medicine now as we are discovering very high levels of Vitamin D deficiency in our population, not only in the U.S., but worldwide. Research is emerging regarding vitamin D deficiency and its effect on neuromuscular function, cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory illnesses, and bone mineralization. Recent evidence has shown that there is a need for increased vitamin D supplementation across the lifespan.

Entia Biosciences, Inc. Names Chief Executive Officer to Manage Growth of Consumer Health Products and To Launch New Medical Food Brands


New Business Strategy to Capitalize on Unique, Innovative and Proprietary Entia Products
SHERWOOD, OR / ACCESSWIRE / August 13, 2015 / Entia Biosciences, Inc. (OTCQB: ERGO), today announced that Carl J. Johnson has joined the Company to serve as its President and Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Johnson has more than 40 years of experience in managing the introduction and marketing of new health-related products as well as executive leadership roles where he last served as President, CEO and Board Member of Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. from 2001 until 2008. Mr. Johnson will be an important addition to the Entia's growth plans and his prior experience will provide focus and commercial discipline to future efforts.
Founder, current CEO and Board Chairman, Marvin S. Hausman MD, will remain Chairman and fill the new and important position of Chief Science and Technology Officer for Entia. This period is a critical time for the Company as it launches its proprietary ErgoD2(R) medical foods for the therapeutic benefit of several chronic diseases. Entia is entering a new phase of commercial activity preparing for the launch of the unique, innovative and proprietary ErgoD2(R) medical food products. Additionally, Entia Biosciences, Inc. is encouraged by the early success of its GROH(R) cosmeceutical product line and is evaluating more aggressive marketing support for these products. This division of responsibilities is an expected apportionment of professional responsibilities as Entia not only expands into a whole new medical industry but also requires greater management of the food studies and product launches. From the many preliminary preclinical and clinical study results observed to date, Entia's all-natural, organic, gluten-free mushroom-based food, ErgoD2(R)-discovered by Hausman, is demonstrating medical potency.
By way of background, Mr. Johnson helped lead Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. and its Zicam(R) brand of cough and cold products grow from $10 million to over $100 million in revenue. He presently serves as a member of the Board of Directors of Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE-PBH). He also served as a Board Member of Matrixx Initiatives from February 2011 to February 2014 and as Interim CEO when the business was acquired by HIG Capital. Previously from 1993 to 2001, Mr. Johnson was Vice President of Commercial Development with Perrigo Company where he was responsible for the procurement of new products and technologies and contract manufacturing services with emphasis on Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) products. From 1972 through 1989, Mr. Johnson worked at Johnson & Johnson (NYSE-JNJ) where he held a number of high-level marketing and sales positions in JNJ's Baby Product's Company. He also served as Vice President of Sales & Marketing for the introduction of Acuvue(R) disposable contact lens products.
According to a statement by Dr. Hausman, "Entia has come a considerable ways from discovery of ErgoD2(R) to introducing our nutraceutical line, creating and sponsoring our own, premium brand cosmeceutical products-GROH(R) and now, developing and launching our own medical food products aimed at actually providing therapeutic benefit for the treatment of certain diseases. The entry of Mr. Johnson should change the entire presence, brand and market awareness of the Company. Mr. Johnson is an experienced executive with a proven track record to help us make these important transitions. His experience in creating, synthesizing, launching and developing 'top-of-mind awareness' of health products in the past is the exact combination of talents we need to further Entia Biosciences, Inc. position and reach across a broad collection of markets. Already, Carl has greatly helped Entia focus our internal attention into the products you will see us pursue as well as help me address the capital markets to better fund the cash requirements to make this plan come to fruition. We expect Carl's contributions will accelerate the growth of our existing nutraceutical and cosmeceutical products as well as help with the launch of our medical food line resulting in broader penetration and increased sales of our ErgoD2(R)-based products."
Carl Johnson commented, "I am very excited to join Entia because of the Company's prospects in all three market areas. Regarding the medical food business, I believe we are at the very beginning of what will become a major new health/therapeutic category. The growth of this new category is driven by the high cost of developing new ethical drugs, the lengthy time-to-market new drugs require, society's increasing demand for organic and whole-food therapies as well as the emerging shift in retail drug merchandizing to provide point-of-care assistance in their outlets. I am pleased to lead Entia as it ventures from its current product base to the medical food opportunity."

Entia Biosciences, Inc. (OTCQB: ERGO) Enters into Exclusive Worldwide Licensing Agreement for its GROH Beauty Products Line

PORTLAND, Ore., Feb.  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Entia Biosciences, Inc. (OTCQB:ERGO) announced that it has licensed to GROH BEAUTY CORP of Deerfield Beach, Florida, the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture and distribute its proprietary GROH® beauty care product line.  The license also has a companion agreement that provides for Entia to manufacture and supply its proprietary ErgoD2® product for use in GROH BEAUTY CORP's manufacture of the various products within the GROH product line.  Together, the license and its companion manufacturing agreement provide Entia with an upfront license fee, on-going royalties based on sales of products containing the ErgoD2 compound and sales revenue from supply of ErgoD2 to GROH BEAUTY CORP.  “We are very pleased to be working with GROH BEAUTY CORP, a new business unit of a proven, successful developer and marketer of beauty and cosmetic products," stated Carl J. Johnson, President and Chief Executive of Entia.  “We are confident that they will generate significant success with the GROH brand and look forward to the additional resources that this license will provide to us.  This is an alternative but superior approach for Entia to the beauty care market and will better contribute to building value for our shareholders than the Company's previous efforts in this area."  Entia’s 2014 entry into the beauty care market did not achieve the success for which the then management had hoped.  Entia's new management has determined that beauty care is not an appropriate area of strategic focus for the Company, planning instead upon developing and profitably marketing clinically-proven health care products that are based upon the Company's novel and proprietary ErgoD2 technology in the nutritional supplement and/or medical food categories.  The Company is taking aggressive yet carefully planned steps toward that end.  Dr. Marvin Hausman, Chief Science & Technology Officer, indicated that Entia plans to introduce its first healthcare product before mid-2017.  The product will likely be introduced as a kidney health supplement.  Kidney health is a growing concern in the U.S. and around the world.  "The Company's research studies among individuals with compromised kidney function have been quite encouraging, if not downright exciting," noted Hausman.  "We are anxiously looking forward to the market rollout of the first of our new healthcare products." "We are delighted to be working with Entia Biosciences and taking over the GROH brand," said Mr. Patrick Neville of GROH BEAUTY CORP.  "With Entia's proprietary ErgoD2 compound, the products have characteristics that the beauty market will find quite desirable.  We plan on making GROH a big winner." GROH BEAUTY CORP plans on its initial GROH rollout by midyear.  In the interim, GROH products will still be available from Entia through existing channels. About Entia Biosciences, Inc. Entia (OTCQB:ERGO) discovers, scientifically validates, develops and markets patented, pharmaceutical-grade organic compounds that include its revolutionary ErgoD2®.  The Company is a leading authority on the clinical effects of oxidative stress, iron-related disorders and free radical reactions in mammals; it is bringing this expertise to the nutraceutical and medical foods markets.  Entia also develops and markets health-related cosmeceuticals.  Entia Biosciences, Inc. is headquartered in Sherwood, Oregon, a Portland suburb. About GROH BEAUTY CORP GROH BEAUTY CORP is a newly established business unit of an international developer, manufacturer and marketer of fine beauty products.  It is based in Deerfield Beach, Florida.

PORTLAND, Ore., Dec.  21, 2015  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Entia Biosciences, Inc. (OTCQB:ERGO) Founder and Chief Science and Technology Officer, Dr. Marvin Hausman, has reported greater-than-expected initial enrollment in Entia’s Chronic Kidney Disease study.  This milestone was achieved during his recent kickoff visit to the study’s test sites in Columbia (South America) and on the Caribbean island of Bonaire.  The initial enrollees represent more than 25% of the quantity of study participants ultimately anticipated to enroll.  This significant number of patients is actively participating in the stabilization phase of the study. Chronic Kidney Disease takes a significant toll on the health of more than 25 million individuals in the U.S. alone.  Progression of the disease leads to dialysis, and eventually the need for a kidney transplant.  The cost to the U.S. Healthcare system was reported as $42.5 billion in 2009 by the National Institutes of Health, and has been growing at a compound rate of +9.8% annually. The product being tested is a specific proprietary blend of Entia’s patented ErgoD2® technology.  Entia Biosciences is the first company to develop, produce and market consumer products with all-natural formulas for the amino acid Ergothioneine and enhanced vitamin D2.   This novel medical food is a supplement to a patient’s existing prescribed regimen of care and is intended to improve iron levels, increase production of red blood cells and increase kidney filtration rates.  If the study proves successful, Entia’s ErgoD2 product formulation for Chronic Kidney Disease will provide patients with the first all-natural, organic medical food product designed to improve the health and well-being of the patient, enhance the dietary management of the disease and potentially slow its progression. Dr. Hausman has been consulting with Dr. Hector Rodriguez, Nephrologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.  In an earlier pilot study of the beneficial effects of the ErgoD2 formulation, Dr. Rodriguez commented, “The results of this study provide a basis for the application of ErgoD2 medical food to potentially modify the course of Chronic Kidney Disease and the nearly inexorable loss of kidney function that dictates the need for dialysis or transplantation.” The application of ErgoD2 is not limited to Chronic Kidney Disease; Entia believes that ErgoD2’s ability to improve iron homeostasis has the potential to mitigate many other conditions related to iron dysfunction.  Entia plans to address several disease markets, all characterized by dysfunctional iron disorders, in which it believes its products may be of significant efficacy.  These disorders, associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, include, but are not necessarily limited to, Anemia, Chronic Kidney Disease, Autism and various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Multiple Sclerosis.   About Entia Biosciences, Inc. Entia (OTCQB:ERGO) discovers, scientifically validates, develops and markets patented, pharmaceutical-grade organic compounds that include its revolutionary ErgoD2®.  The Company is a leading authority on the clinical effects of oxidative stress, iron-related disorders and free radical reactions in mammals; it is bringing this expertise to the nutraceutical and medical foods markets.  Entia also develops and markets health-related cosmeceuticals.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Names Chief Executive Officer to Manage Growth of Consumer Health Products and To Launch New Medical Food BrandsAccesswireAugust 13, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareNew Business Strategy to Capitalize on Unique, Innovative and Proprietary Entia ProductsSHERWOOD, OR / ACCESSWIRE / August 13, 2015 / Entia Biosciences, Inc. (ERGO), today announced that Carl J. Johnson has joined the Company to serve as its President and Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Johnson has more than 40 years of experience in managing the introduction and marketing of new health-related products as well as executive leadership roles where he last served as President, CEO and Board Member of Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. from 2001 until 2008. Mr. Johnson will be an important addition to the Entia's growth plans and his prior experience will provide focus and commercial discipline to future efforts.Founder, current CEO and Board Chairman, Marvin S. Hausman MD, will remain Chairman and fill the new and important position of Chief Science and Technology Officer for Entia. This period is a critical time for the Company as it launches its proprietary ErgoD2(R) medical foods for the therapeutic benefit of several chronic diseases. Entia is entering a new phase of commercial activity preparing for the launch of the unique, innovative and proprietary ErgoD2(R) medical food products. Additionally, Entia Biosciences, Inc. is encouraged by the early success of its GROH(R) cosmeceutical product line and is evaluating more aggressive marketing support for these products. This division of responsibilities is an expected apportionment of professional responsibilities as Entia not only expands into a whole new medical industry but also requires greater management of the food studies and product launches. From the many preliminary preclinical and clinical study results observed to date, Entia's all-natural, organic, gluten-free mushroom-based food, ErgoD2(R)-discovered by Hausman, is demonstrating medical potency.By way of background, Mr. Johnson helped lead Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. and its Zicam(R) brand of cough and cold products grow from $10 million to over $100 million in revenue. He presently serves as a member of the Board of Directors of Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE-PBH). He also served as a Board Member of Matrixx Initiatives from February 2011 to February 2014 and as Interim CEO when the business was acquired by HIG Capital. Previously from 1993 to 2001, Mr. Johnson was Vice President of Commercial Development with Perrigo Company where he was responsible for the procurement of new products and technologies and contract manufacturing services with emphasis on Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) products. From 1972 through 1989, Mr. Johnson worked at Johnson & Johnson (NYSE-JNJ) where he held a number of high-level marketing and sales positions in JNJ's Baby Product's Company. He also served as Vice President of Sales & Marketing for the introduction of Acuvue(R) disposable contact lens products.According to a statement by Dr. Hausman, "Entia has come a considerable ways from discovery of ErgoD2(R) to introducing our nutraceutical line, creating and sponsoring our own, premium brand cosmeceutical products-GROH(R) and now, developing and launching our own medical food products aimed at actually providing therapeutic benefit for the treatment of certain diseases. The entry of Mr. Johnson should change the entire presence, brand and market awareness of the Company. Mr. Johnson is an experienced executive with a proven track record to help us make these important transitions. His experience in creating, synthesizing, launching and developing 'top-of-mind awareness' of health products in the past is the exact combination of talents we need to further Entia Biosciences, Inc. position and reach across a broad collection of markets. Already, Carl has greatly helped Entia focus our internal attention into the products you will see us pursue as well as help me address the capital markets to better fund the cash requirements to make this plan come to fruition. We expect Carl's contributions will accelerate the growth of our existing nutraceutical and cosmeceutical products as well as help with the launch of our medical food line resulting in broader penetration and increased sales of our ErgoD2(R)-based products."Carl Johnson commented, "I am very excited to join Entia because of the Company's prospects in all three market areas. Regarding the medical food business, I believe we are at the very beginning of what will become a major new health/therapeutic category. The growth of this new category is driven by the high cost of developing new ethical drugs, the lengthy time-to-market new drugs require, society's increasing demand for organic and whole-food therapies as well as the emerging shift in retail drug merchandizing to provide point-of-care assistance in their outlets. I am pleased to lead Entia as it ventures from its current product base to the medical food opportunity."Read MoreAbout Entia Biosciences, Inc.Entia is an authority on the clinical effects of oxidative stress and free radical reactions and is bringing this expertise to the fields of food science biotechnology and Nutrigenomics.
