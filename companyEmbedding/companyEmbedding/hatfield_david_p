It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View David’s Full ProfileSummaryMy passion is in taking very early stage ideas, re-shaping them into viable market driven business concepts, and then creating the strategy, business model, team, and financial backing to turn them into Series A funded companies of significant value.  Having worked and consulted for both start-ups and Fortune 40 companies, I also understand the barriers and needed changes required to accomplish similar results in large companies seeking re-vitalization.Much that I have learned in these activities and through volunteer work is applicable to non-profits seeking growth. I have a heart for philanthropy. In all my activities, I particularly value the opportunity to work with and mentor young adults.I am continually seeking and evaluating advisory roles.ExperienceAdvisorRing CamAugust 2014  –  Present (3 years)In the rapidly growing $11B industry of wedding videography there is one critical moment that remains uncaptured.  The moment the proposal is actually made!   Ring Cam™ is a jewelry box with a hidden HD video camera, easily operated by the proposer.  It creates an everlasting and electronically sharable portrait of this once in a lifetime moment.  With appearances on Good Morning America, Fox & Friends, and the CNN home page, Ring Cam™ is a product going viral in awareness and sales.   As an advisor, I am helping the Yes Cam LLC team hone their business strategy, identify and attract key new team members and advisors, gain grant money, attract investors, win business plan competitions, continually identify and prioritize critical issues, and implement creative ways to address those issues.   Check us out at http://getringcam.com/.  The videos of actual proposals will delight you.CEO and Co-founderCovaron Advanced MaterialsSeptember 2012  –  April 2014 (1 year 8 months)Covaron is a advanced materials company with technology best described as a “thermosetting ceramic.”  Covaron materials are poised to enable extraordinary increases in performance versus current materials such as steel, aluminum, silicones, thermoset polymers, and engineering thermoplastics. In my tenure as CEO of Covaron, my key contributions with support from the Covaron team were:- Identification of a viable business strategy that provided short term sales opportunities, future opportunities of significant value, and the prioritized growth in capabilities needed to capture these opportunities- Recruitment of key personell including expderienced managers in intellectual property, business development, contract manufacturing, technology development, and the CEO who replaced me.- Attracted and managed relations with investors that provided $250K of seed funding, $300K of economic development loans and grants, and a significant series A round of financing - Helped create business plan competition presentations and presented at the Accelerate Michigan Business Plan Competition resulting in $175K of non-dilutive grants and significant investor exposure- Led team in continually identifying critical issues and creating action plans to address them.  This allowed us to progress in 18 months from a business idea to a funded company of significant value.Director, OwnerThe Hatfield Group LLCMay 2004  –  September 2012 (8 years 5 months)The Hatfield Group LLC  helped start-ups and established companies create growth through developing opportunities faster, with greater value, and reduced risk.   This is done by identifying opportunities, de-risking those opportunities, and identifying viable entry strategies at a lower cost and at a higher speed than clients could accomplish on their own.  Results are accomplished through unique processes in opportunity identification and de-risking, including  Hypothesis Directed Learning®, a process that bridges the gap between idea generation and commercialization by systematically de-risking new business concepts.New Business Development DirectorDow Chemical1997  –  2004 (7 years)Multiple Commercial and Marketing leadership positions in Engineering Thermoplastics, Polyurethanes, Epoxies, and Chemical Intermediates.

David Hatfield, CEO of Edgewell Personal Care

































































St. Louis this month gained a new public company and a new corporate name with the successful split of Energizer Holdings into two consumer products giants.The company that kept the Energizer name is focused on batteries and lighting products, and remains based in Town and Country.The other, Edgewell Personal Care, took over more than two dozen consumer brands, many sold around the globe, including Schick razors, Banana Boat sunscreen and Wet Ones hand wipes. That portfolio of personal care brands generated $2.6 billion in sales last year.
Based in Chesterfield, Edgewell employs 6,000 people, including 175 locally.David Hatfield, the new chief executive of Edgewell, took a moment last week to reflect on the massive, yearlong undertaking that created two companies, and the strategy that will guide his company going forward.Most spinoffs involve only a small fraction of a company, Hatfield said in an interview. But the separation of Energizer’s household and personal care divisions was nearly a 50-50 split, ratcheting up the complexity of the task.“We divided a company across 50-plus countries,” he said. “Folks have done a superb job, and we’re looking forward to a new beginning.”Hatfield didn’t stop to ruminate on the past for long, however. Edgewell is putting a bigger priority on international growth than it did previously, he said, and the company is investing heavily in innovation to develop new products. Acquisitions — a critical part of the company’s prior growth — will help propel the company’s global growth, he added.Hatfield started at Eveready’s battery division in 1988, 12 years before Energizer and the Eveready brand were spun off from Ralston Purina Co. During his career, he helped oversee several major acquisitions as Energizer diversified beyond its battery base, including purchasing the Schick-Wilkinson Sword razor business in 2003 for $930 million and the $1.9 billion acquisition of Playtex Products in 2007.
With the battery division now a separate company, Edgewell can focus on its core business, personal care products, Hatfield said.“We compete in attractive categories and we have strong brands,” he said.In addition to Schick razors and Edge and Skintimate shaving preparation products that account for 61 percent of Edgewell’s sales, Edgewell’s brands include Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen, and Playtex and o.b. tampons. Feminine care and sun/skin care each account for about 16 percent of sales, with infant and other products totaling 7 percent of sales.
“We’ve been built through acquisitions over time,” Hatfield said. “We have a legacy of disciplined M&A and we look to continue that going forward. Our philosophy is we look to stay close to our core. We’re going to look at businesses in categories we compete in, particularly in suncare, and adjacencies such as skin care and grooming.”RAZOR FOCUSWith razors and shaving prep products accounting for more than half of its business, the segment is Edgewell’s No. 1 focus, Hatfield said. Edgewell’s wet shave net sales totaled $1.6 billion in fiscal 2014, with 45 percent of sales in North America, 28 percent in Europe, 19 percent in Asia and 8 percent in Latin America.“Management will be relying on increased investment behind the growth brands, innovation, leveraging of the entire portfolio (including private label), and international expansion, particularly in developing markets,” John Faucher, a J.P. Morgan analyst, wrote in a recent research note. Procter & Gamble’s Gillette is the market leader for razors in the U.S., followed by Edgewell’s Schick brand. Both Gillette and Schick face increasing competition from Harry’s and Dollar Shave Club, which are growing their online razor sales.Hatfield said he’s watching the online competitors closely.“That’s an interesting phenomenon that we have to watch,” he said, adding that most online competitors aren’t profitable and are burning through cash.If the online competitors survive, Hatfield said Edgewell’s private label razor business could act as suppliers. “We’re positioned well to help them,” he said.
