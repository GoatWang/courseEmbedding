A1 Group, Inc. Key Developments

A1 Group, Inc. Signs North American Licensing and Distribution Agreement with Trec Beverages, Inc
Mar 21 17
A1 Group, Inc. announced that it has signed an exclusive North American licensing and distribution agreement with TREC Beverages, Inc. TREC Beverages' core portfolio beverage item is the "Slow Cow(r)" Mind Cooler(TM). Slow Cow, owned by Boisson Slow Cow, Inc., is currently distributing and developing its products in 20 countries throughout the world. With their natural infused sparkling water designed to help relax user's mind and body, sharpen user mental focus, all without causing drowsiness.

A1 Group, Inc. Signs Licensing and Distribution Agreement with Novaceutical Sciences, Inc
Jan 12 17
A1 Group, Inc. announced that it has signed a global master licensing and distribution agreement with Delaware-based Novaceutical Sciences, Inc. Nasal delivery systems are an exceedingly effective way for delivering even complex molecules across the epithelial cell layer that covers the nasal cavity. This allows for systemic blood circulation without hepatic and intestinal metabolism and systemic delivery can be achieved within five minutes for smaller molecules. Accordingly, nasal administration provides rapid delivery and avoids the degradation of compounds in the gut and liver which is often seen with oral administration of pills and capsules. The Novaceutical Sciences patent pending technology is focused on providing intranasal and pulmonary delivery of vitamin and essential trace mineral nutrients. Typically, vitamins and trace minerals are delivered orally in tablets, capsules and gummies. Previous to the NSI technology, oral delivery has been the major challenge for essential mineral bioavailability. The intranasal system can even achieve delivery to the brain through the blood-brain barrier. Areas of treatment include: energy, memory, sexual health, neuro-protection and repair, anti-anxiety and others. Specific nutrients can be selected to enhance formulations suitable for different market verticals.
