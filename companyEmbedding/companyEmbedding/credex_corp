Unity Functions and Features
Origination of Installment and Single Pay Loans

Calculation of interest, insurance and fees (ex. Consumer Installment & Single Pay Loans)
Consumer Document Printing

Loan Processing

Centralized Loan Approval


Branches &/or dealers submit applications
Instantly viewed by one or more experienced loan reviewers
Instant electronic communication between approver and branches/dealers
Document Imaging—scan documents at branch/dealer for instant review by the approver
NO MORE FAXING OF APPLICATIONS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS!



Address Verification

Ensure all new loans are entered with a valid address. A search is performed against a North American US based address database which will notify of a discrepancy or alert that the address cannot be verified/found.


OFAC Verification

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) name verification is available in Unity. A search is performed against the “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List” database to ensure the name of your client is not found at loan origination.


Credit Bureau Inquiry

Unity eliminates the need for duplicate entry with our integration into Credit Bureau.
    Enter information in the appropriate area and:

Credit report is displayed on the screen for viewing/printing
Application fields are populated with creditor information
All credit reports are saved for future viewing



Document Approval

Integrated Document approval allows all authorized employees to have instant online access to any origination documents thus eliminating copies being mailed or transported to main office.
This option includes electronically mandating scanning of mandatory documents


Document Imaging

Document Imaging is integrated with the Unity system. Scanned documents replace copied images on file reducing storage space. Save time by enabling employees to quickly & easily view or print documents at the press of a button. Documents are readily available while approving a loan, taking payment or handling collections. Documents are indexed by social security number. Images can be created from a flatbed or multi-page scanner.


Auto Value Inquiry

Credex has integrated Black Book into Unity to give our clients the convenience of easily establishing “Auto Value” without leaving the system. Black Book is widely known and highly respected in the industry for offering timely, independent and accurate used car values.



Payment Processing & Collections

ACH

Loan payments can be automatically drafted from customer checking/savings account with Unity’s ACH module.


Debit Card Processing

Built into our loan software is the ability to post a payment with your customer’s card. You have the option to manually key the card in or use a swipe machine tied into our system. We do an immediate authorization from our software and if the money is available, post the payment! The funds are deposited into your bank account. No need for a separate card system.


Check by Phone

Your customers can make payments by phone. They provide you with their checking or savings account information and our software provides the electronic interface to debit their bank account and places the money into your bank.


Centralized Collections

Unity allows staff at a central location to place collection calls for all branches, update comments, promise dates and much more. Reports are available which allow you to measure performance on each collector.


Text Messaging

Integrated into Unity, messages are sent in mass instead of one at a time. Use for solicitation, late notices, payment reminders and collection notices. Save time and money.



Security

Hosting

All programs, including your loan information, are stored in the secure data center of our partner, Venture Technologies.
Hosting offers:

Highest possible security
Access from any internet connection
Software updates handled for you
We take care of file backups
You never run out of processing power and file space
Redundant equipment
Continuous power supply



Protection Plus

If your office was hit by a natural disaster, or went up in smoke tonight, would your entire business be dependent on a few backup disks? IF THOSE DISKS WERE BAD…WOULD YOU LOSE EVERYTHING?
Any one of the disasters listed above can be devastating to your company but now you can protect yourself by using PROTECTION PLUS to let us backup your files and protect your data.
By using an automated method of storing your Credex data files offsite, you can be assured of having a reliable backup when you need it. Backups will be stored in another city using the latest data encryption technology. In the event of a disaster you can count on us for a quick recovery of your valuable customer data.



Management

Branch Audits

With Unity there is no need to make frequent visits to track branch activity. All loans are stored in one place for real time access from any internet location.


Dealer Management

Unity's Dealer Management system will allow you easy access to, and management of, your dealer information. The system tracks all dealer originated loans, reserves and service charges. A full range of reporting is available.


Auto Title Tracking

Documents such as auto titles may or may not be available at the time a loan is made. With Unity the dealer can note on the customer’s account if title is in hand at time of loan creation and add when available.


Auto Repo Tracking

Repossession of automobiles is a fact of life, especially in today’s market. Unity cannot remove that fact, but we can help ease the pain of tracking automobile repossessions.
Unity offers our clients flexibility by allowing them to set up multiple Repo companies, sellers and codes to manage the repo portion of their business.



Marketing

Text Messaging

Integrated into Unity, messages are sent in mass instead of one at a time. Use for solicitation, late notices, payment reminders and collection notices. Save time and money.

	Forward-Looking
	Statements





	 




	This
	report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
	as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  All statements other than
	statements of historical facts are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of these provisions, including any projections
	of earnings, revenues or other financial items, any statement of the plans and objectives of management for future operations,
	any statements concerning proposed new products or strategic arrangements, any statements regarding future economic conditions
	or performance, and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.  In some cases, forward-looking statements
	can be identified by the use of terminology such as “may,” “will,” “expects,” “plans,”
	“anticipates,” “estimates,” “potential,” “intends”, or “continue”
	or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology.  Although the Company and its management believe that the expectations
	reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations
	or any of the forward-looking statements will prove to be correct, and actual results could differ materially from those projected
	or assumed in the forward-looking statements.  The Company’s future financial condition and results of operations,
	as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the Risk
	Factors set forth under Item 1A, and for the reasons described elsewhere in this report. All forward-looking statements and
	reasons why results may differ included in this report are made as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update these
	forward-looking statements or reasons why actual results might differ.




	  







	PART
	I





	 







	Item
	1. Business





	 





	Overview





	 




	Credex,
	a Florida corporation, was formed on September 2, 2005. The Company was formed for the purpose of raising the necessary funds
	for purchasing, servicing, managing and reselling of non-performing (defaulted) unsecured credit card debt portfolios to be acquired
	from financial institutions and distressed debt wholesalers. Since its inception, the Company derived no revenues and no income
	from such business and as result as of December 31, 2016, had an accumulated deficit of $349,129.




	 




	We
	are a development stage company with no revenues or operating history. Our address is 848 Rainbow Blvd, # 2096 Las Vegas, Nevada
	89107. The telephone number is 801-243-5661. While our address is in Nevada, our sole officer and director currently operate our
	business from Utah without an office and through the use of phone and email.




	 




	The
	Company has attempted to attract private placement investments in the past. Thus far, the Company has not been able to implement
	its plans or begin operations because it has not been successful in raising the equity capital necessary to implement such plans.




	 




	There
	is no current public market for our securities. As our stock is not publicly traded, investors should be aware they probably will
	be unable to sell their shares and their investment in our securities is not liquid.




	 




	At
	the present time, we are classified as a “shell company” under Rule 405 of the Securities Act Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange
	Act. As such, all restricted securities presently held by the affiliates of our company may not be resold in reliance on Rule
	144 until: (1) we file Form 10 information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) when we cease to be
	a “shell company”; (2) we have filed all reports as required by Section 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Act for twelve
	consecutive months; and (3) one year has elapsed from the time we file the current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting
	our status as an entity that is not a shell company.




	 





	Bankruptcy
	Or Similar Proceedings






	 





	There
	has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding involving the Company.




	 





	Reorganization,
	Purchase Or Sale Of Assets






	 





	Other
	than the acquisition of the patent, there have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale
	of a significant amount of assets involving the Company.




	 







	 



	2



	 







	 









	 





	Effect
	Of Existing Or Probable Governmental Regulations On The Business






	 





	The
	Company will be subject to numerous national, international, regional, state and local laws. The Company does not know when or
	whether additional legislation may pass or whether any such legislation would relate to the types of services currently planned
	to be provided by the Company or which the Company intends to develop. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the effect, if
	any, that any such future regulation may have on its business.




	 





	Research
	And Development Activities During The Last Two Years






	 





	We
	have not expended funds for research and development costs since inception.




	 





	Costs
	And Effects Of Compliance With Environmental Laws






	 





	We
	don’t anticipate material costs or expenses related to compliance with environmental laws. Hydrogen is a clean energy sector
	and there may be some tax incentives associated with this sector.




	 





	Number
	Of Total Employees And Number Of Full Time Employees





	 




	We
	currently have one employee, our executive officer, Russell Heaton. He devotes five (5) hours per week, to our business and currently
	is responsible for our general strategy, fund raising and customer relations. Once the offering is complete we will hire additional
	staff if we generate enough revenue to support the expense. The number of additional staff will depend upon our growth.






	 








	Item
	1A. Risk Factors





	 




	An
	investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the
	other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business,
	operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade
	at a later date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.




	 





	RISKS
	ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS





	 






	We
	are a development stage company and have no operating history. An investment in the shares offered herein is highly risky and
	could result in a complete loss of your investment if we are unsuccessful in our business plan.






	 




	Credex
	was incorporated on September 2, 2005 and we have not yet commenced any business operations. Until we are actually in the marketplace
	for a demonstrable period of time, it is impossible to determine if our business strategy will be viable or successful. Any such
	failure could result in the possible closure of our business or force us to seek additional capital through loans to continue
	business operations, which would dilute the value of any shares you purchase in this offering.




	 






	Because
	our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, there is a substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations in which
	case you could lose your investment.






	 




	Our
	auditors have issued a going concern opinion because of the Company’s losses, limited working capital and the absence of
	any current revenue-generating operations. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business
	for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about
	our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment.




	 







	 



	3



	 







	 









	 






	We
	cannot predict when or if we will produce revenues, which could result in a total loss of your investment if we are unsuccessful
	in our business plans.






	 




	We
	have not yet implemented our business plan or offered our services. Therefore, we have not yet generated any revenues from operations.
	In order for us to continue with our plans and open our business, we must raise our initial capital to do so through this offering.
	The timing of the completion needed to commence operations and generate revenues is contingent on the success of this offering.
	There can be no assurance that we will generate revenues or that revenues will be sufficient to maintain our business. As a result,
	you could lose all of your investment if you decide to purchase shares in this offering and we are not successful in our proposed
	business plans.




	 






	Our
	business will be dependent on our ability to sell hydrogen units. If we are unable to sell and secure more technology our business
	will be adversely affected.






	 




	If
	we are unable to develop and sell, we may not be able to execute our business plan. We have no agreements of any kind at this
	time. If we are unable to secure and retain new agreements our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could
	be materially and adversely affected. We also cannot provide assurances that if we are able to establish such agreements that
	we will be able to maintain these agreements, on acceptable terms, if at all, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse
	effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.




	 






	Our
	success depends, in significant part, on global and regional demand and any factors that may have an adverse effect on such markets
	could have a material adverse effect on our proposed business, financial condition and results of operations.






	 




	Our
	plan is to find a merger candidate or opportunity in the hydrogen sector. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results
	of operations will be directly affected by the demand for our products. Demand is subject to fluctuation, and adverse trends in
	the market could adversely affect our business. In addition, general economic conditions, consumer trends, energy prices, work
	stoppages, natural disasters and terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business. A protracted global recession
	could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.




	 






	The
	hydrogen industry is highly competitive, which could adversely affect the company’s financial performance.






	 




	The
	hydrogen industry is highly competitive. We will face significant competition from established national, regional and local providers.
	There can be no assurance that if we are able to establish our business that will be able to compete successfully in the future
	with existing or potential competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on its business and financial condition.




	 






	We
	may not be able to adapt our business quickly enough to changing customer requirements and industry standards.






	 




	The
	Hydrogen industry is characterized by evolving industry standards, frequent production enhancements and changing customer demands.
	We may not be able to adapt quickly enough and/or in a cost-effective manner to changes in industry standards and customer requirements
	and preferences, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business. We may be unable to devote financial resources
	to new technologies and systems in the future. Any failure on our part to modify or adapt to these trends could render our business
	competitively disadvantaged, which could adversely affect our business.




	 






	Any
	failure to comply with existing laws, rules and regulations as well as changing laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties,
	could adversely affect our business.






	 




	We
	will be subject to a wide variety of statutes, rules, regulations, policies and procedures in various jurisdictions, which are
	subject to change at any time. For example, those laws, rules and regulations relating to energy.




	 







	 



	4



	 







	 









	 




	Our
	failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against us by governmental agencies
	and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, the promulgation
	of new laws, rules and regulations that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we plan to operate
	and may require us to change certain aspects of our business plans to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for Hydrogen,
	reduce revenues, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities.




	 






	We
	may need to obtain additional financing if we fail to generate revenue in the anticipated timeframe. If we do not obtain such
	financing, we may have to reduce or cease our activities and investors could lose their entire investment.






	 




	Our
	business plan will be funded by public offering, but that there is no guarantee that any amount will be raised. Even if we are
	successful, there is no assurance that we will operate profitably or generate positive cash flow in the future. We may require
	additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in receiving revenues at the levels we anticipate.
	We currently do not have any arrangements for further, and we may not be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms
	or terms that are acceptable to us or on any terms at all. Because of the worldwide economic downturn or because of other reasons,
	we may not be able to raise any additional funds that we require on favorable terms, if any. The failure to obtain necessary financing,
	if needed, may impair our ability to continue in business.




	 


	 








	You
	may suffer significant dilution if we raise additional capital.






	 




	If
	we raise additional capital, we expect it will be necessary for us to issue additional equity or convertible debt securities.
	If we issue equity or convertible debt securities, the price at which we offer such securities may not bear any relationship to
	our value, the net tangible book value per share may decrease, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders would be diluted,
	and any equity securities we issue in such offering or upon conversion of convertible debt securities issued in such offering,
	may have rights, preferences or privileges with respect to liquidation, dividends, redemption, voting and other matters that are
	senior to or more advantageous than our common stock.




	 






	If
	we obtain debt financing, we will face risks associated with financing our operations.






	 




	If
	we obtain debt financing, we will be subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash
	flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and the risk that we will not be able to renew,
	repay, or refinance our debt when it matures or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing
	terms of that debt. If we enter into secured lending facilities and are unable to pay our obligations to our secured lenders,
	they could proceed against any or all of the collateral securing our indebtedness to them or our other assets including the funds
	in the escrow account.




	 






	Our
	success is dependent on a limited number of key executives and other third party advisors.






	 




	The
	success of our business strategy and our ability to operate profitably depends on the continued employment of our senior management
	team and the services of other third party advisors. The loss of the services of one or more of these key parties could have a
	material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will
	be able to retain our existing senior management, attract additional qualified executives or joint venture partners or adequately
	fill new senior management positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover. We do not have employment agreements with
	our senior management team and we do not maintain key-person life insurance policies on their lives. The loss of any of our senior
	management or key personnel could seriously harm our business.




	 






	We
	have no experience in the Hydrogen industry.






	 




	Credex
	does not have substantial Hydrogen industry experience or financial resources. With such a lack of experience there can be no
	assurance that we will ever generate revenues or operate a successful business. As a result, you could lose all of your investment
	if you decide to purchase shares in this offering and we are not successful in our proposed business plans

	Mr.
	Heaton, the sole officer and director of the company, currently devotes approximately five (5) hours per week to company matters.
	The company’s needs could exceed the amount of time or level he may have. this could result in a conflict of interest and
	his inability to properly manage company affairs, resulting in our remaining a start-up company.






	 




	We
	have not formulated a plan to resolve any possible conflict of interest with Mr. Heaton’s other business activities. In
	the event he is unable to fulfill any aspect of his duties to the Company or we are required to search for a replacement for Mr.
	Heaton we may experience a shortfall or complete lack of sales resulting in little or no profits and eventual closure of our business.




	 






	Our
	management has no experience in a public company setting. Management decisions and choices may not take into account standard
	operating procedures required for a public company. as a result, we may have to suspend or cease activities which will result
	in the loss of your investment.






	 




	Mr.
	Heaton, our sole officer and director, has no experience as the principal executive officer or principal financial officer of
	a public company. Consequently, our activities, earnings and ultimate success could suffer irreparable harm due to management’s
	lack of experience. As a result, we may have to suspend or cease activities which will result in the loss of your investment.




	 






	Potential
	liability could cause Credex to go out of business


	.




	 




	The
	Company’s intended operations and both the activities of the Company could expose it to potential liability for which it
	may not be able to secure adequate levels of insurance. If the Company is found to be liable, it may not be able to continue in
	business.




	 


	 








	We
	may fail to adhere to SEC filing requirements


	.




	 




	Adherence
	to securities laws, regulations and standards require substantial legal and financial expertise and compliance costs. If our efforts
	to comply with securities, laws, regulations and standards, investors may not receive key information on a timely basis and regulatory
	authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.

	No

	price for the stock. The Company has no equity compensation plans and there are no shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise
	of outstanding options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into, common stock of the Company. Other than the registered
	offering for shareholders pursuant to Registration No. 333-170829, there is no common equity being, or publicly proposed to be,
	publicly offered by the Company, the offering of which could have a material effect on the market price of the Company’s

	future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board, subject to compliance with applicable
	law and any contractual provisions, including under any agreements for indebtedness we may incur, that restrict or limit our ability
	to pay dividends, and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital
	requirements and other factors that our Board deems relevant.

	Overview






	 





	We
	are a development stage company. Although Credex has not operated pursuant to its business plan, in 2005 Credex purchased a portfolio
	of defaulted credit card debt to test the feasibility of its business plan. On a trial basis accounts from the portfolio were
	collected. The remainder of the portfolio was then sold. Our auditors have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue
	as a going concern. We need a minimum of approximately $100,000 during the next 12 months to begin implementation of our business
	plan.




	   




	We
	are a development stage company with no revenues or operating history. Our address is 848 Rainbow Blvd, # 2096 Las Vegas, Nevada
	89107. The telephone number is 801-243-5661. While our address is in Nevada, our sole officer and director currently operates
	our business from Utah without an office and through the use of phone and email.




	 







	 



	7



	 







	 









	 




	Since
	our inception, we have devoted our activities to the following:




	 




	(1)
	Purchasing a debt portfolio;




	 




	(2)
	Obtaining bids from professional collectors to collect the portfolio;




	 




	(3)
	Developing contacts from whom to purchase portfolios;




	 




	(4)
	Contracting for operational support; and




	 




	(5)
	Securing enough capital to carry out these activities.




	 





	Plan
	of Operations






	 





	As
	discussed above we have not yet operated pursuant to our business plan. We have generated no revenue in 2016 or 2015.




	 





	Comparison
	of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015






	 






	Lack
	of Revenues





	 




	We
	have limited operational history. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 we have not generated any revenue. We anticipate
	that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate any revenues in the next 12 months
	continues to be uncertain.




	 





	Operating
	Expenses





	 




	The
	Company’s operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $9,000 and $6,850 respectively. Operating
	expenses in 2016 consisted of professional fees of $8,250, stock transfer agent fees of $600 and general and administrative expense
	$150. Operating expenses in 2015 consisted of professional fees of $5,750, stock transfer agent fees of $950 and general
	and administrative expense $150.  





	 






	Net
	Loss





	 




	During
	the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized net losses of $9,000 and $6,850.




	 







	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	Our
	capital resources have been acquired through the sale of shares of our common stock and loans from shareholders and third parties.




	 




	At
	December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had total assets of $0 and $0 respectively.




	 




	At
	December 31, 2016 and 2015, our total liabilities were $47,687 and $38,687 respectively consisting primarily of accounts payable
	and shareholder loans.




	 




	Net
	cash used in operating activities was $11,050 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and was $5,900 for the year ended December
	31, 2015. The net cash used in operating activities was related to an increase in operating expenses.



	 



	Net
	cash provided by financing activities was $11,050 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and was $5,900 for the year ended December
	31, 2015. The cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to shareholder loans.




	 




	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company received loans from a shareholder of the Company through Sterling
	Investment Corp., a related party, totaling $11,050 and $5,900, respectively.

	Cash
	Requirements

	intend to provide funding for our activities, if any, through a combination of the private placement of the company’s equity
	securities and the public sales of equity securities.




	 




	We
	have no agreement, commitment or understanding to secure any funding from any source.




	 





	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	 



	To the
	Board of Directors and




	Stockholders
	of Credex Corporation



	 



	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheets of


	 


	Credex
	Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and
	cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Credex Corporation’s management is responsible for these financial
	statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.



	 



	We conducted
	our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
	that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
	The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
	appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
	basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
	estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
	a reasonable basis for our opinion.



	 



	In our
	opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Credex
	Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 the results of their operations, and their cash flows, for the years ended December
	31, 2016 and 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.



	 


	As discussed in Note B to the financial statements,
	the Company has incurred losses from operations, has negative working capital and is in need of additional capital to grow its
	operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's
	plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note B. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
	to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result
	should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	NOTES
	TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	December
	31, 2016 





	 





	NOTE
	A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	Organization
	and Purpose





	 




	Credex
	Corporation, (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Florida on September 2, 2005. The company is looking renewable
	energy and hydrogen technologies and develops new markets. The Company is currently reviewing various technologies. The Company
	is also exploring avenues for raising capital in order to put its business plan into effect. The Company’s principal office
	is in Las Vegas, Nevada.




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 



	The accompanying financial statements have been in accordance with
	U.S. GAAP and rules of SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary in order to for the financial statements to
	be not misleading have been properly reflected herein.



	 





	Accounting
	Basis





	 




	The
	Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”
	accounting).  The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.




	 





	Cash
	and Equivalents





	 




	For
	purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less
	than three months to be cash equivalents.




	 





	Financial
	Instruments





	 




	Financial
	instruments consist of accounts payable and loans from related parties. The carrying amount of financial instruments approximates
	fair value due to short-term maturities and market interest rates.




	 





	Advertising





	 




	The
	Company expenses advertising and promotions costs as they are incurred.




	 





	Concentrations
	of Credit Risk





	 




	The
	Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company
	continually monitors its banking relationships and consequently has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes
	it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.

	NOTES
	TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	December
	31, 2016 





	 





	NOTE
	A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)





	 





	Earnings
	per Share





	 




	Basic
	earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
	stock shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the
	weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the year plus potential dilutive instruments such as stock options
	and warrants. The Company has no dilutive instruments outstanding.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets
	and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax
	returns.




	 




	Under
	this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
	assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred
	tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets
	will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
	in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
	liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date.




	 




	The
	Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the Codification ("Section 740-10-25") which addresses the determination of whether
	tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25,
	the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
	will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized
	in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
	percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition,
	classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The
	Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section
	740-10-25.




	 





	Stock-Based
	Compensation





	 




	Stock-based
	compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 718. To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option
	plan and has not granted any stock options.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
	during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	NOTE
	A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)





	 





	Comprehensive
	Income





	 




	The
	Company has which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated
	balances. When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement of Stockholders’ Equity.
	Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The
	Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive
	income.  




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	On
	June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
	(Topic 915).   Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage
	entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US
	GAAP.  In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
	information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a
	development stage entity;  (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
	and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been
	in the development stage.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and
	interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim
	reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued.  The Company has elected to early adopt these
	amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial statements as those of a development stage entity and have not presented
	inception-to-date information on the respective financial statements.



	 



	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update “ASU” 2014-15 on “Presentation of Financial Statements
	Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) – Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern”.
	Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial
	doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments
	in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of
	footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by
	incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments
	(1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods,
	(3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when
	substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans, (5) require an express statement and
	other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date
	that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to
	determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 



	 




	NOTE
	B – GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company’s
	financial position and operating results raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company
	has sustained losses of $349,129 since inception to December 31, 2016. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
	is dependent upon expanding operations and obtaining additional capital and financing. Management’s plan in this regard
	is to implement the Company’s business plan and to secure additional funds through equity or debt financing. The financial
	statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

	NOTE
	F – INCOME TAXES





	 




	For
	the period ended December 31, 2016, the Company has incurred net losses and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred
	tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has been fully reserved. The cumulative net operating loss carry-forward is approximately
	$349,129 at December 31, 2016, and will expire beginning of the year 2025.




	The
	provision for Federal income tax consists of the following for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

	Due
	to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $349,129
	for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating
	loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.





	 








	NOTE
	G – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	 




	In
	accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company

	has analyzed its operations subsequent to December 31,

	There
	are none.





	 







	Item
	9A. Controls and Procedures.





	 





	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	 




	The
	Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company handles all aspects of the company.




	 




	 Based
	upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure
	controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2016 due to the Company’s small size and a lack of segregation
	of duties.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 




	There
	were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2016 that have materially
	impacted, or are reasonably likely to materially impact, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.




	 





	Management's
	Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 




	Management
	is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
	and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
	by, or under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and implemented by
	the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
	of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”).




	 




	The
	Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  i) pertain to
	the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
	assets of the Company; ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
	statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are made only in accordance with authorizations
	of management and directors of the Company; and iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
	unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material impact on the financial
	statements.




	 




	The
	Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s
	disclosure controls and procedures, or the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting, will necessarily prevent
	all fraud and material errors. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
	not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
	the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
	of the inherent limitations on all internal control systems, the Company’s internal control system can provide only reasonable
	assurance of achieving its objectives and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
	instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
	in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
	be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.
	The design of any system of internal control is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
	and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
	potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances, or because the degree
	of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.




	 




	Management
	of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
	of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 and determined that controls are ineffective
	due to the Company’s small size and lack of segregation of duties.

	This
	annual report does not include an attestation report by our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
	financial reporting.  Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm
	pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only our management report in this annual
	report.

    financing.

The timber industry is highly competitive. We will face significant competition
from established national, regional and local forestry providers. There can be
no assurance that if we are able to establish our business that will be able to
compete successfully in the future with existing or potential competitors or
that competition will not have an adverse effect on its business and financial
condition.


Company Description
Credex, a Florida corporation, was formed on September 2, 2005. The Company was
formed for the purpose of raising the necessary funds for purchasing, servicing,
managing and reselling of non-performing (defaulted) unsecured credit card debt
portfolios to be acquired from financial institutions and


 distressed debt
wholesalers. Since its inception, the Company derived no revenues and no income
from such business and as result as of December 31, 2012, had an accumulated
deficit of $309,281.

The Company recently decided to pursue a new business opportunity and entered
into a memorandum of understanding (the “MOU”) with Kirida Resources Inc.
(“Kirida”), to pursue and implement forestry management programs in emerging
market countries. Kirida is a Canadian company that has options to manage
forests in Papua New Guinea, Liberia and Cameroon. Kirida has a team of
professional forestry management experts to implement harvesting programs as per
international environmental standards with reforestation programs and product
certifications. The Company is currently reviewing forestry management and
harvesting projects with Kirida. Based on its review, the Company intends to
decide whether to pursue certain opportunities based on several factors
including revenue potential.

The Company was introduced to Kirida through mutual contacts in the summer of
2013. During its discussions with Kirida, the Company learned about attractive
global investment opportunities in timber, particularly in Liberia given the
availability and accessibility to the forested land for logging and development,
the ability to acquire land, the ability to obtain required licenses for logging
and forestry activities, the high quality timber species and high demand in
Europe and Asia for logs, sawn wood and other processed and specialty products.
After learning more, the Company approached Kirida about potentially
collaborating to make an investment in timber.

Other than the MOU, we currently have no agreements and do not anticipate
entering into any such agreements until we complete this offering. We intend to
use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations. 

The Company has attempted to attract private placement investments in the past.
Thus far, the Company has not been able to implement its plans or begin
operations because it has not been successful in raising the equity capital
necessary to implement such plans.
