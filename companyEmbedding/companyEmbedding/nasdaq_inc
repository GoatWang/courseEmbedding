Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a leading provider of trading, clearing, exchange technology, listing, information and public company services across six continents. Nasdaq is the creator of the world's first electronic stock market, and its technology is used by more than 85 marketplaces in 50 countries, and 1 in 10 of the world's securities transactions. Nasdaq is home to more than 3,700 listed companies with a market value of $10.0 trillion and approximately 18,000 corporate clients. 
Beyond its network of equity and derivatives exchanges, Nasdaq also develops and provides the backbone technology for exchanges as well as banks, brokers, central securities depositories (CSDs), clearinghouses and trading firms around the world. It offers listing services to companies and a variety of data services, from real time market information and analytics to corporate governance and investor services solutions. 
[1]
The company was ranked as the 11th largest derivatives exchange in the world by contract volume in 2015, according to the annual Futures Industry Association's (FIA) survey.[2]
Nasdaq's own market capitalization was $11 billion as of November 2016.
Nasdaq's tech division provides the core technology needed to build and operate an exchange, clearing house, depository and surveillance department for a stock or derivatives marketplace. Nasdaq supports the operations of more than 70 marketplaces in over 50 countries for exchanges, clearinghouses, depositories and regulators. It also provides surveillance and risk management technology to more than 75 brokers in over 80 countries, as well as buy side and sell side firms. 
In terms of listing services on its own markets, it has more than 3,700 companies listed on its US, Nordic and Baltic exchanges, which represents more than $9.3 trillion in overall market value. Smaller companies can list on its First North market in Europe. It also operates Nasdaq Private Market to help firms identify partners and support before they go public.
[3]
Nasdaq's intel division offers more than 90 market data, global index and corporate solutions across 70 different countries for 2.5 million direct customers. It currently has about 41,000 Nasdaq global indexes. Corporate solutions provides distribution of market information for public and private companies' investor relations, public relations and governance departments.
The company was ranked as the seventh largest derivatives exchange in the world by contract volume in 2016, according to the annual Futures Industry Association's (FIA) survey. Volume that year was 1.5 billion, down 4.4 percent from the previous year.[4]
Nasdaq's own market capitalization is $11 billion as of November 2016. 

Background of the Combined Entity
Early Days for Nasdaq
Nasdaq was founded by the National Association of Securities Dealers, or NASD, which was charged with preventing market abuses after the Great Depression and wanted to create a way for investors to buy and sell stocks on a computerized, transparent, and fast system. Nasdaq was founded in 1971 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FINRA, and the Nasdaq Stock Market debuted on February 8 of that year as the world’s first electronic stock market, listing more than 2,500 securities.[5]. 
The company underwent a restructuring in 1982, debuting its National Market System (NMS), later changed to Nasdaq National Market. The NNM added refinements such as making the price and volume information of each trade available 90 seconds after execution, as opposed to after the close of trading.
Nasdaq separated from the National Association of Securities Dealers in 1987. In 2000, NASDAQ membership voted to restructure and spin off Nasdaq into a shareholder-owned, for-profit company.[6]
FINRA divested its ownership of Nasdaq in 2006, and The NASDAQ Stock Market became fully operational as an independent registered national securities exchange in 2007.[7]

Dot Com Boom, Bust And Technology
Nasdaq is credited with the invention of both electronic trading and the modern IPO. In the 1990s it revolutionized the equities trading world, introducing near-real time quotes for OTC stocks. It also helped usher in the era of public trading of technology companies like Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Dell and Intel. During the technology company boom, or so-called "dot-com bubble," in the 1990s, Nasdaq benefited from the excitement over Internet and technology stocks. About 89 percent of all U.S. initial public offerings during 1999, for example, took place on Nasdaq, according to Nasdaq: A History of the Market That Changed the World by Mark Ingebretsen. But when the dot-com bubble collapsed in 2000, so did the Nasdaq Composite Index, losing 78 percent of its value that April. [8]
In 1991 Nasdaq became the first exchange to sell its technology to other exchanges, as well as the first to have an integrated derivatives trading and clearing system. In 1995, it became the first to sell market technology in Asia.[9]  Nasdaq’s market technology is used by, among others, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Singapore Exchange, Tokyo Commodity Exchange, Japan Exchange Group, Bursa Malaysia and SBI Japannext.[10]

Nasdaq's IPO, Bob Greifeld and Early Acquisitions
Restricted shares of Nasdaq were initially sold by the NASD in 2000 through a private placement offering. 
Also in 2000, Nasdaq created Nasdaq-Liffe Markets (NQLX) as a joint venture between Nasdaq and LIFFE to offer trading in security futures, including single-stock futures, on the LIFFE CONNECT platform. NQLX shut down in October 2004 because of lack of liquidity and consolidated its remaining contracts into positions at OneChicago.[11]
In June 2001, the company opened Nasdaq Europe, seeing it as a first step in implementing its global strategy in Europe. In November 2001 it announced a partnership between Nasdaq Europe and the Berlin Stock Exchange.
Trading restrictions expired in 2002 and shares began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol NDAQ.
Robert Greifeld became the CEO of Nasdaq in 2003, when the company operated one equity market in the U.S., and led the company through a series of important acquisitions that expanded the company globally and into all asset classes. Rivalry between Greifeld's Nasdaq and John Thain's New York Stock Exchange heated up when the NYSE made a surprise purchase of the electronic exchange Archipelago in April of 2005, vastly upgrading its electronic offering when ECNs were on the rise. Two days later, Nasdaq acquired Instinet Group for $1.88 billion, giving it a greater share of the equity market.[12]
On Feb. 9, 2005, NASDAQ listed its shares on The Nasdaq Stock Market following an offering of secondary shares priced at $9 per share.
Greifeld set the exchange on a course for more acquisitions after its IPO, including two failed attempts 
to acquire the London Stock Exchange, the first in March of 2006.[13]  A second hostile bid was rejected by the LSE's shareholders  in November of 2006, and LSE executives spurned further discussions with Nasdaq executives.[14]

NASDAQ Acquires OMX: Goes Global Multi-asset
The company's biggest acquisition was the purchase of the Nordic exchanges' OMX AB on February 27, 2008, which resulted in an expansion of the business from a U.S.-based exchange operator to a global company offering its exchange technology to marketplaces all over the world.  The acquisition made Nasdaq OMX Group the world's largest exchange company, hosting the trading of 4,000 stocks world-wide, and allowed it to provide trading platforms supporting multiple asset classes, as well as listings, financial services technology, data and financial products.[15]  Although OMX was little known to many U.S. investors at the time, some of the world's biggest brand names listed there, including Nokia and Volvo.[16]
Nasdaq removed OMX from its branding almost seven years after the acquisition of the Nordic exchange group.
As part of the transaction, NASDAQ OMX Group also became a 33.33 percent shareholder in DIFX, Dubai's international financial exchange. Borse Dubai is a 19.9 percent shareholder of NASDAQ OMX Group.[17]
Before the merger with OMX, the Nasdaq Stock Market (NASDAQ) listed itself as the world's second-largest cash equities platform by trading volume and the biggest electronic screen-based equity securities market in the U.S. in terms of listings and traded share volume.[18]
Nasdaq launched a second equity exchange in Jan. 2009 after it acquired the Boston Stock Exchange in August of 2008 for $61 million and renamed it NASDAQ OMX BX. [19]
The company continued to expand into other assets classes, moving into US equity options in March of 2008 after receiving approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the NASDAQ Options Market, an equity and index options market.
The NASDAQ OMX Group acquired Nord Pool ASA, the world's largest power derivatives exchange and one of Europe's largest carbon exchanges, in 2010, and it became part of NASDAQ OMX Commodities.
Nasdaq also acquired the Copenhagen Exchange, created in 1808, when it acquired OMX.[20]

Nasdaq Goes To Philly and Into Interest Rates
Nasdaq signed an agreement to acquire the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the oldest stock exchange in the U.S., on November 7, 2007.[21]
Nasdaq then launched a futures exchange in January of 2009 after it acquired the Philadelphia Board of Trade (PBOT) in 2008 as part of its acquisition of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The renamed Nasdaq Futures Exchange (NFX) lists futures products, including interest rate swap futures, currency futures and sector index futures.[22]
NFX currently offers trading in electricity, Henry Hub natural gas, Brent Crude oil, WTI Crude oil, heating oil and gasoil. [23]
Nasdaq's expansion into interest rate derivatives began with the launch of NASDAQ OMX NLX in London on May 31, 2013. (It was later rebranded Nasdaq NLX). The market, led by NLX CEO Charlotte Crosswell, started trading initially with six products including the German bund and Euribor, in direct competition with the two biggest exchanges in the region.[24]
Nasdaq gained further exposure to the fixed income markets on July 1, 2013, when it acquired the electronic Treasuries trading platform eSpeed from BGC Partners Inc.  The platform — which trades two-, three-, five-, seven-, ten- and 30-year instruments — became part of Nasdaq OMX's Transaction Services business. [25] [26] [27] [28]
The exchange branched out further in 2013 with its acquisition of Thomson Reuters’ investor relations, public relations and Multimedia Solutions businesses. That same year the company also acquired eSpeed, the leading provider of electronic trading of U.S. Treasury Securities.

Greifeld & Sprecher Bid For The Big Board
NASDAQ OMX Group and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) attempted to acquire NYSE Euronext in 2011 for $11.3 billion, but withdrew its bid after the U.S. Department of Justice threatened an antitrust lawsuit. [29] [30]
In 2013, NasdaqOMX Group acquired Thomson Reuters’ investor relations, public relations and Multimedia Solutions businesses.[31]

Facebook IPO Fallout
Facebook listed its IPO on Nasdaq on Friday, May 18, 2012, but trading in the stock was delayed and technical glitches led to confusion, incomplete orders and mispricing. [32]  When trading began at 11 a.m. the Nasdaq system was overwhelmed by 496,000 orders that sent Nasdaq’s computers into a continuous loop that made it impossible to establish a correct opening price for Facebook stock. 
In May of 2013 the SEC levied a $10 million fine against Nasdaq OMX regarding the problematic Facebook IPO . The SEC cited “poor systems and decision making” both before and after the Facebook initial public offering. In addition to the $10 million fine, Nasdaq had already agreed to pay $62 million to the brokers who lost money because of the problems.[33]
In April 2015, Nasdaq OMX agreed to pay $26.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over the Facebook IPO. The suit said Nasdaq broke the law in failing to disclose technology weaknesses in its IPO systems and failing to properly design and test them for the Facebook offering. It was the first time a court had sustained a class action suit against a stock exchange.[34]
As part of the fallout from the IPO, in January 2014 Nasdaq said it no longer wanted to run the securities information processor, or SIP, the marketwide quote service that broke down and froze thousands of its U.S. stocks on August 22, 2013. [35] However, Nasdaq later reconsidered and made a bid for the contract in 2014, becoming one of two finalists to run the SIP, the other being Tradeworx Inc.’s Thesys Technologies LLC. [36] In November 2014 Nasdaq beat out Thesys and won the right to keep running the SIP, with a mandate to create a subsidiary to manage it.[37]
