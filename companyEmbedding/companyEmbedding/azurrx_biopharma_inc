		Digestive Enzymes

Are Proteases needed for EPI compensation?
Energy loss due to nitrogen malabsorption in EPI is mild or null:

Energy loss by creatorrhea increase in EPI is nearly null (5 gram of fecal nitrogen in very severe EPI correspond to 20 kcal/day)
Compensation of pancreatic protease (i.e. trypsin) by other GI enzymes
PPEs have no detectable effects on fecal nitrogen loss and mild effect on transfer dietary nitrogen to metabolic pools (1)

Proteases and/or Eudragit® of PPEs are suspected in the pathophysiology of fibrosing colonopathy:

Usually observed in CF children <12 years of age, treated for more than 6 months with high-doses of enteric-coated PPEs,
Pancreatic enzymes, together with NSAID, administered via duodenal catheter to rats for 10 days induce ulcers in the cecum and colon (2,3),
Eudragit® L30D55 given by oral (rats) or caecal gavage (adolescent pigs) induce fibrosing colonopathy-like changes (4).

Are Amylases needed for EPI compensation?

Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyses starch to maltose,
Saliva amylase can at least in part compensate EPI, while the rest of starch can be metabolized by the gut microflora (1),
Deficiency is poorly documented in patients with EPI,
Inherited pancreatic amylase deficiency result in mild symptomatology, i.e. fermentative diarrhea in children , which disappear with a starch free diet (2).

		Chronic Pancreatitis

Chronic pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas that does not heal or improve, gets worse over time, and leads to permanent damage.
Causes

The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach that produces chemicals (called enzymes) needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon.
When inflammation and scarring of the pancreas occur, the organ is no longer able to make the right amount of these enzymes. As a result, your body may be unable to digest fat and key elements of food.
Damage to the parts of the pancreas that make insulin may lead to diabetes.
The condition is most often caused by alcohol abuse over many years. Repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis. Genetics may be a factor in some cases. Sometimes, the cause is not known.
Other conditions that have been linked to chronic pancreatitis:
Autoimmune problems (when the immune system attacks the body)
Blockage of the pancreatic duct or the common bile duct, the tubes that drain enzymes from the pancreas
Complications of cystic fibrosis
High levels of a fat, called triglycerides, in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia)
Hyperparathyroidism
Use of certain medications (especially sulfonamides, thiazides, and azathioprine)
Chronic pancreatitis occurs more often in men than in women. The condition often develops in people ages 30 - 40.

Symptoms
Abdominal pain:

Greatest in the upper abdomen
May last from hours to days
Eventually may be continuous
May get worse from eating or drinking
May get worse from drinking alcohol
May also be felt in the back

Digestive problems:

Chronic weight loss, even when eating habits and amounts are normal
Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting
Fatty or oily stools
Pale or clay-colored stools

AzurRx BioPharma, Inc. Provides Update on MS1819 Phase II Trial
Apr 11 17
AzurRx BioPharma, Inc. announced that it is providing an update on the ongoing open-label Phase IIa trial of lead candidate MS1819 for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency associated with chronic pancreatitis. The trial is being conducted in partnership with Mayoly Spindler. Early results indicate that MS1819 exhibits a favorable safety profile, with no moderate or severe adverse events having been reported to date. Regarding efficacy, results to date indicate that MS1819 is active, as measured by coefficient of fat absorption, which is the parameter being measured for the primary efficacy endpoint. There was a favorable dose response of greater than 20% improvement in CFA seen in all patients at either the second or third of the four escalating dosage levels of MS 1819. These early efficacy and favorable safety results from the ongoing Phase IIa trial confirm data from the previously performed Phase Ib trial of MS1819. The company expects study completion in the third-quarter of 2017. The study is being performed at four sites in Australia and New Zealand with a target enrollment of 12-15 patients. In addition to assessing safety, the company is evaluating four escalating dose increments of MS1819, with the aim of elucidating the optimal treatment dose to be taken into subsequent registration trials in EPI patients with chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis.

AzurRx BioPharma, Inc. is a clinical development-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in the research and development of non-systemic biologics for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. The Company's product pipeline consists of two therapeutic proteins, such as MS1819 and AZX1101. MS1819 is an acid-resistant secreted lipase produced by Yarrowia lipolytica, known as LIP2, that the Company is developing through recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), associated with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and cystic fibrosis (CF). AZX1101 is a recombinant-lactamase combination of bacterial origin under development for the prevention of hospital-acquired infections by resistant bacterial strains induced by parenteral administration of b-lactam antibiotics (known as nosocomial infections), as well as the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD).

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
