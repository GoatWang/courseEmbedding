Stacey L. Neu
By Freya In testimonials-page On September 14, 2014

Mark Richardson is an incredibly talented professional. He possesses a versatile background in business, not for profit, and government. His experiences have provided a remarkable well-rounded foundation. I worked with Mark during his broadband days at Charter Communications. He was a highly regarded marketing leader with high business/financial acumen.
I have since partnered with Mark on projects in his subsequent positions. As an HR executive, it is not often I see such an adaptable talent. His experiences have presented him with a unique skill set which serves him well to drive results through collaborative processes/exchanges. In my experience, this is one of his signature strengths. Additionally, he has a nicely balanced leadership style of strategy and expert tactician. He has proven his ability again and again to tackle complex issues with a results and action oriented mindset. He’s resourceful. He just knows how to get things done!
