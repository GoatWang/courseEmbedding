Penske Supports Active and Veteran Military Personnel
We thank all military personnel for their service. To help make your move easier, Penske offers a military discount off truck rentals at more than 2,200 convenient locations.
Dedicated Call Center for U.S. Military Moves
We have introduced a specialized call center to assist active and veteran members of the U.S. military and their families with do-it-yourself moves. Each Penske call center associate has a military connection: as a veteran or with a family member who is active duty, reservist or a veteran. Please call this toll-free number, 1-844-4TROOPS (1-844-487-6677).
Military Discounts Add Up

Book your rental online for an automatic 10% off.*
Show your military or veteran ID when you pick up your truck for an additional 10% off.

Certified Public Scale Locator
A military do-it-yourself move (aka a DITY move) requires that you weigh your vehicle before you load it and after. To make finding a scale easier, use our Certified Public Scale Locator.
*Penske customers always save 10% when reserving a one-way truck rental online. Present your military ID at pick-up to save an additional 10%. Or, if you are a AAA member, use your AAA card when booking your reservation to save 12%. Combined discounts cannot exceed 20%.
