Corporate Responsibility
Lippert Components aims to protect the environment and save resources by selecting sustainable materials and production processes. We use quality recycled materials whenever possible, especially for packaging, and we work to improve our recycling and sustainability programs every year.




400Tons
We eliminate nearly 400 tons of dangerous Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) every year by powder-coating our products instead of using coatings comprised of solvents or other harmful materials.

1Million
Two of our large facilities have solar arrays on the roof, producing more than 1 million KW Hours per year. We are looking into adding other systems using natural resources at other facilities.

900Tons
We regrind more than 900 tons of ABS plastic scraps annually from two thermoforming plants and send them back to our supplier to recycle and reuse.

200Tons
We recycle more than 200 tons of cardboard every year.

16,000Tons
We recycled more than 16,000 tons of metal in 2012 and that number grows every year.











Leadership In The Community




"CAPS is so grateful to the employees of Lippert Components for the many ways they partner with us in strengthening families and keeping children safe."




We impact our community not only through good business, but also through charitable giving and volunteer work. We encourage employees and teams to volunteer to support healthy and safe communities, and we give thousands to nonprofit organizations every year. But more than anything, we’re so proud to see our teams coming together, supporting coworkers as they fight cancer or struggle to pay medical bills for a sick child. The stories of caring and generosity among our teams inspires us to do more every day.
