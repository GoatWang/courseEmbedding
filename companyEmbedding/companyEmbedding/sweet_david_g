I wo...uld love to know more details on the corruption going on in the petfood industry here in AUSTRALIA.
There are hundreds of documentaries and Canadian groups who are working towards self funded research to debunk pet food conglomerates lies, yet here in Australia there aren't many who have the position of influence to bring the evidence to the people.
I loved the simplicity and scientific accuracy of "Sweet POISON". We need a similar book for our animals. 
People who choose to eat slow cooked whole foods who then feed their dogs poisoned kibble is so illogical and astounds me. See MoreLike · Comment · ShareElwood HindleyJuly 25 at 8:18pmHi David, re: identifying psychopaths as discussed with Richard Fidl...er.
you made a global statement to identify a psychopath during a job interview , to look for lack of stability in their work history. And that they jump around a lot, never hold a job for more than 18 mths Etc.
i just want to say there are many reasons for lack of stability in the work place such as dealing with PTSD , pregnancy, illness or the structure of how the job market actually is for the majority of people.

Todays generation would be lucky to keep a job contract for 18 months. Add in lack of tertiary education and there is a perfect environment for job instability.

At the other end of the spectrum, I have worked for and under many people who displayed all the classic psychopathic traits and continued to hold court for many years.

Here are the some tips for how to manage a psychopathic boss in the workplace. 1. Give them what they want. "Absolute obedience, no questions asked," Gillespie said. "Do what they ask you to do, when they ask you to do it. No matter how stupid it is, as long as it's legal, do it. 2. Confirm everything in writing. "If they want you to move dirt from pile A to pile B and back again, make sure you confirm it in writing. Not an emotional response,... no sarcasm, just a clarification of the task that has been asked of you." 3. Flatter them. "This is a key thing. And they will believe every word of it. They believe they're the best person in the universe." 4. Take notes. "Do exactly what James Comey did with Donald Trump. When you walk out of a meeting, write down exactly what happened." 5. Maintain your circle of friends and relationships. "Have people who know what you are going through. Because if you come home upset and say 'he made Mary finish my report,' people are going to think you're crazy. What they have to understand is it's part of a nonstop chain of events." See MoreIs Your Boss A Psychopath? How To Spot The Signs"In any Anglo Saxon-dominated workplace there are probably more psychopaths than people with red hair."huffingtonpost.com.auDavid Gillespie · July 25 at 4:38pm · Forget the Handmaid's Tale's enslaved breeder women, in our non-fiction future, males capable of reproduction will be as rare as hen's teeth.   According to a massive new Israeli study reported today, sperm concentrations in Western men have declined by more than 50 per cent over the past 40 years. Reproductive toxicologist Dr Shaun Roman from the University of Newcastle said the role of diet and environment would need to be vigorously investigated but maintains 'we are not i...n crisis yet' I beg to differ.   There are as many theories about why this is happening as there are scientists researching the problem.  Perhaps it is the increased levels of oestrogen in the diet, perhaps it is exposure to pesticides or perhaps it is the use of BPA plastics.  But only one has produced convincing evidence of causation – dietary omega-6 fat consumption.  And that evidence goes a lot further than noticing that Israel is the highest consumer of omega-6 fats in the world. This is just latest in a long series of human trials which show vegetable oil consumption significantly impairs a man's ability to reproduce. The evidence just keeps stacking up - you might not be able to save our society but you can help your husbands, brothers and sons - keep them away from vegetable oil.

Just click the link below to pre-order and go in the draw.  Here's how it starts: Imagine for a minute that you are carving your way, machete in hand, through impenetrable jungle in some terribly exotic place. You happen upon a clearing when suddenly you notice you are not alone. On the other edge of the glen, a stone’s throw from you, stands a tiger. He is starin...g intently at you. Assessing you. He doesn’t care whether you love your mother, what your favourite colour is or even that tomorrow is your birthday. To him, you are one of just three things: a meal, entertainment or too nasty to bother with. The tiger will test you. He will growl, bare his teeth, or make an imperceptible, but swift, movement in your direction. These are all tests. He is probing you. Monitoring you for signs of strength or weakness. He will use every faculty millions of years of adaptation have given him, to determine whether you are trouble, or lunch. You cannot reason with him, you cannot threaten him, you cannot plead for mercy. Your only chance of survival is to convince him that you are more trouble than you are worth. If you manage that, he will turn and walk away without a backward glance. If you can’t, your goose is cooked. Well, eaten. The tiger’s cold assessment of your meal-worthiness is the same as the one your psychopathic boss, workmate, relative or lover performed on you within the first few seconds of meeting you. This is a book about convincing the tiger you are more trouble than you’re worth. And if you are really brave, it is a book that can tell you how to catch and tame the tiger. After all, who wouldn’t want a pet tiger? See MorePre-order Taming Toxic PeopleBook will be released on 25 July 2017 Pre-Orders from this site will be signed by David and individually numbered.

That…davidgillespie.orgDavid Gillespie · July 18 at 4:07pm · In the past 12 months in South Australia, 2,500 children under the age of eight needed dental treatment under general anaesthetic. That is a 55 per cent increase over the past decade! South Australia has had a fluoridated water supply since 1971.  Can we finally abandon the idiotic notion that tooth decay is caused by an absence of fluoride?  Can we finally admit that the problem is and always has been sugar?  Can we finally stop stop consigning children to whole-mouth clearances (all teeth removed) because the sugar industry has our health industry and politicians in its pocket?Sugar to blame for rising dental issues in babiesSouth Australian babies are increasingly needing treatment in hospital for dental issues.abc.net.auDavid Gillespie · July 15 at 7:01pm · Lengthy article on the new book in this weekend's Courier Mail (Brisbane) but here's the best bit: "...the aim of Taming Toxic People is not to point the finger at anyone but to give people tools to assess someone as “potentially being this type of person” and give them ways to defend themselves. In a work environment, for ­example, Gillespie advises anyone who fears the boss may be a psychopath to take contemporaneous notes. “Be polite, be professional and record everything,...” ­Gillespie says. “As soon as whatever conversation has ­occurred, make notes in your own time and they will come in handy because one of the things psychopaths have difficulty with is maintaining a consistent story.” Documented abuse makes company lawyers nervous, he adds. He further advises if you are working for a psychopath – and he identifies excessive micromanagement and centralising all decision-making as key indicators – then your only choice is scrupulous personal honesty, politeness and compliance, doing exactly what you are asked to do, without responding emotionally. ..." See MoreYour boss is most likely a psychopathBRACE YOURSELF. NOT ONLY were Mother Teresa, Winston Churchill and Gandhi possible psychopaths, but so was Jesus Christ, aka the Son of God.couriermail.com.auDavid Gillespie · July 11 at 3:23pm · Why are doctors so keen on drug based solutions?  Perhaps it is the 30,000 free 'information sharing' events (which include at least a free meal) provided for them every year by the pharmaceutical industry - that's more than 100 every working day and that is just in Australia alone!Australian doctors get a massive dose of marketingDrug companies and medical groups argue marketing events are valuable places for a busy doctor to learn. But the evidence suggests otherwise.smh.com.auDavid Gillespie · July 10 at 9:52pm · According to this 'expert' "Diabetes isn’t caused by having too much sugar, but by a failure of the pancreas to produce enough insulin to control glucose levels in the blood, says Caroline Butler, a care adviser for Diabetes UK. This means having too much sugar cannot in itself cause it. However, Type 2 diabetes can be triggered by excess weight gain, perhaps through eating too many sugary foods." This is typical of the sort of advice dispensed by diabetes organisations in Au...stralia too.  It is the equivalent of saying a car accident wasn't caused by brake failure it was caused by running into another car.  The fact that so-called professionals can generate such utter codswallop and not ask the simple question, 'but what causes the pancreas to fail?' shows how shallow the talent pool is in nutritional 'science' The answer by the way is insulin resistance brought on by accumulation of fatty acids in the liver (in turn brought on my over consumption of fructose) ... How do I know that?  Because the science is old and freely available but clearly accessing it is beyond the ken of those employed to look after our health. See More'Sugar triggers diabetes' and eight other health myths that aren't strictly trueLeading health experts separate fact from fiction as they debunk some of the biggest myths about our food - and its impact on our healthmirror.co.ukDavid Gillespie · July 7 at 12:43am · High levels of sugar consumption during pregnancy doubled the chances of a child developing allergic asthma, according to a UK study of almost 9,000 mothers and their children. The sugar link with asthma may be explained by high intakes of fructose triggering an immune response leading to inflammation in developing lungs, the scientists said. Freely-consumed sugar in early childhood had no effect on the results, researchers said. It was foetal sugar exposure that was important, they underlined.Expectant mothers advised to avoid excess consumption of fructoseEating too much sugar in pregnancy doubles child’s asthma risk, study findsirishtimes.comDavid Gillespie · July 5 at 12:17am · My new Book will be released on 25 July 2017.

This time he takes aim at the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA). "Often you see DAA spokespeople, instead of sounding the sirens on the dangers of sugar as you'd expect, actively playing down the dangers ...  Australia is in the middle of an obesity epidemic, in large part because instead of the 2 kilograms a year of sugar that humans are equipped to eat without damage the average Australian is consuming 20 to 30 t...imes that amount, and the association is saying stuff that could only please sugar interests? Do you find it, perchance, weird, and even troubling, that just last month the DAA held a seminar for its dietitians on "The Future of Foods" within the offices of Coca-Cola in North Sydney? Wouldn't that be like the Lung Foundation having a meeting of its medical professionals in the offices of British American Tobacco, all good friends and jolly good compan-y? And of course this column will draw a robust denial from the DAA that the food and beverage companies have any influence on it whatsoever. But let it answer this: if the likes of Coca-Cola, Kellogg's and Nestle don't have any influence on you, DAA, what are they getting for their money?" See MoreThe not-so-sweet link between Big Sugar and the peak body for dietitiansWe need a government that insists the public health infrastructure be freed from the influence of Big Sugar.smh.com.auDavid Gillespie · June 23 · When the Dietitians Association and the Heart Foundation fly into a frenzy to decry a diet which asks people to avoid processed food, any thinking person would ask, why?  Is there science behind this or have these two venerable organisations simply become mouthpieces for the processed food industry that provides them with such significant financial support?  Such is the corrosive power of conflicts of interest. There are now very persuasive reasons to worry about their advice... that we should consume seed oils (vegetable oils). And there is just as compelling evidence that ignoring sugar is taking a daily toll on the health of all Australians. We need the Heart Foundation to follow the lead of the Canadian Heart Foundation and immediately trash its Tick program. And we need our dietitians to throw off the yoke of corporate sponsorship and provide evidence based dietary advice untainted by the smell of food industry money. We don’t need the guardians of our health attacking a scientifically (and logically) defensible aversion to processed food. We need them guarding our health without fear or favour (especially without favour). See MoreIf the Heart Foundation and Dietitians Association didn’t exist, would the food industry need to invent them?spend quite a bit of their time attacking what they call “Fad Diets”.  Unfortunately, their flat out disregard for the evidence is making their statements sound more and more like press releases issued by the processed food industry.davidgillespie.orgDavid Gillespie · June 20 · There's been a flurry of stories over the report this week that Coconut oil is as unhealthy as animal fat.  That is true but not in the sense I think they mean.  They are both the best possible sources of fat you can get. The report is a highly selective analysis of studies conducted in the 1960s.  I say highly selective because they manage to completely ignore two of the largest randomized controlled trials ever conducted on the question of healthy fat, the MCE and the Sydne...y Diet Heart Trial.  (Both linked in comments below) Unpublished results from both have recently been analysed by the US National Institutes of Health.  The conclusion from the MCE (a trial of almost 10,000 people) was that substitution of vegetable oils for animal fats did lower cholesterol BUT INCREASED death rates from all causes by 22%!  And did nothing to improve your chances of having a heart attack. The Sydney trial arrived at similar conclusions.  Vegetable Oils increased death from all causes by 62% and death from heart disease by 70%! Don't fall for this ego protecting self justifying nonsense from the Heart Association.  The real evidence is damning - Saturated Fat (no matter the source) is ALWAYS a better choice than vegetable oil See MoreCoconut oil 'as unhealthy as beef fat and butter' - BBC NewsIt is packed with saturated fat which can raise "bad" cholesterol and pose a heart risk, say US experts.bbc.com|By BBC NewsDavid Gillespie · June 12 · Great piece from Peter Fitzsimons on the 'Health' Star System: "the current Health Star system steers the masses from the edge of the supermarket where you can get the fresh products of Australian farmers to the long aisles where you get the products of Big Food and Big Sugar. I repeat. Milo! Four and a half stars! Get it into your kids! And you know what, if I put strawberry-flavoured milk on their Nutri-Grain and sprinkle it with Milo they will surely be BURSTING with good ...health."

See More'It's freaking hopeless': why the Health Star Rating System has to goLet's start with the fact that the food industry sits on the advisory panel. Ludicrous.smh.com.auDavid Gillespie · June 7 · Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.  This week a researcher from Baker IDI in Melbourne established that Australian softdrink is worse for us than US softdrink because, wait for it, ours contains less fructose (50% as opposed to the 55% in US drinks sweetened with HFCS). The reasoning is as childish as it is misconceived.  Less fructose means more glucose which means a higher glycemic index (GI - blood sugar response).   The theory goes that if we could make sur...Continue ReadingAustralian soft drinks linked to higher risk of diabetesSoft drinks sold in Australia have higher levels of glucose, which is linked to an increased chance of developing heart disease and type 2 diabetes, a study shows.abc.net.auSee More

Top-quality and nutritious snacks and meals in the break room are a must for any busy office. The line of Staples food for the workplace includes numerous items from popular name brands in the variety needed to suit all taste palates and nutritional regimens.

Choose from the Best Snacks 
Snacks usually come in easily stored jars and packets with a long shelf life, ensuring there are plenty of items available for a hungry work crew or staff putting in overtime. Some snacks are designed to satisfy hunger pangs, such as potato and corn chips, pretzels, popcorn, peanut-butter sandwich crackers and bite-size crisps. Most of the best snacks have more nutritional value, including granola, fruit and multigrain cereal bars, as well as peanuts, walnuts, almonds, cashews and trail mix. Beef jerky and beef sticks are available for the pure carnivore. Snacks can also gratify a sweet tooth, so choose from butter and chocolate-chip cookies, a variety of chocolate bars, sugar wafers and fig bars. All items are from name brands, including Keebler, Planter's, Frito Lay, Nature Valley, Pepperidge Farm and Kellogg's. These companies have built their reputation over many years by providing the best snacks that people love to eat.

Provide More Substance with Quick Meals

Workers sometimes require more than the best snacks on the market, so Staples carries a variety of containers and cans that provide hearty meals. Some of the food is ready to eat, including deli meat and cheese combos, along with fruit cups such as applesauce. Other ready-to-eat meals include packaged tuna and chicken salad and potted pork, beef and chicken. Canned peas, green beans and rice dishes as well as other light meals are ready for an office stovetop or microwave. Macaroni and cheese, ramen noodles and soup cups also provide quick meals. For the early-morning crew, oatmeal and cereal are available. 

Enjoy Favorite Snacks and Meals 


Staples carries the most commercially successful snacks and meals on the market. There is a large variety available in smaller portions or in bulk for large offices or busy workplaces. When you want to outfit a break-room pantry, Staples covers all the snacks and meal bases you need.


Make sure you get your deals!
