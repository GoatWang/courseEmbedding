            I bought the CD because of the song Sovereign but I love the rest of the CD too, especially.....I Lay Me Down...and Christ Around Me!    I don't buy a lot of Michael Smith but heard him sing Sovereign on TV and knew I had to have it.   I am a big fan of Terry MacAllum and Don Moen

            i hadn't been a big fan of MWS. I was more Third Day & Newsboys.  I really love this album. The album is upbeat and love the music.  I am now a big fan of MWS.

            Been a fan of MWS for many years.  Although this CD is not live like some of his other worship CD's, it is filled with great lyrics and upbeat music - great for driving and singing along with!
