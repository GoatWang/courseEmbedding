Oakridge Global Energy Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB: OGES) Announces New Product Lineup -- Cool Design Range Of Unique Lithium-Ion Smart Energy Cells
PALM BAY, FL--(Marketwired - Aug 1, 2016) - Oakridge Global Energy Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB: OGES), a leading US-based manufacturer of lithium-ion smart energy cells for military, civilian and medical applications, is excited to announce that after extensive design work internally during Q2, 2016, the company has completed all design work on its new, ground-breaking "Generation 2" series of lithium-ion smart energy cell products and is now readying them for commercial production during Q4, 2016.
The new "Generation 2" product series includes the following new lithium-ion smart energy cell products: the "ProSeries 2" Golf Car energy cells (for all the three major golf car manufacturers, Yamaha, Club Car and Ez-Go, as well as a "Universal" model which fits all golf car designs), the Freedom IV Lite and Ultra-Lite portable energy packs, the Freedom V Living Space Energy Storage unit and the "UMed" portable universal medical device power pack for medical applications including CPAP units.
Other new lithium-ion smart energy cell products and product revisions are also in development and will be released during Q3, 2016.
All these "Generation 2" Oakridge lithium-ion smart energy cells utilize the latest in lithium ion energy cell technology, and provide Oakridge products with a significant performance edge over the competition by exploiting the maximum benefits of Oakridge's important Japanese strategic relationships which the company has put in place since the beginning of 2016.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.

Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.
