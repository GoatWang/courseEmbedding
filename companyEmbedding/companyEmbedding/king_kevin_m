High St, North Baltimore, OhioKevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2012年4月13日 · Oh Darn! Did I forget to tell you to breathe? I hope you did not hold your breath for the last 2 weeks! Now that we are all getting so much better with minding our posture and holding in our bellies, we can concentrate on breathing. Regardless of what you are doing, keep the belly tight and breathe deep in thru the nose. Breathe out thru the nose to the point that you are forcing every last drop opf air out of the lungs. If you are exerting yourself and the body is demanding more oxygen, speed up the process by forcing the air out thru the mouth. Try breathing like this while you are taking that fast walk? Force the last little drop of air out of your lungs and refill through the nose. Often, it is more important to GET CARBON DIOXIDE OUT of the lungs than it is to get oxygen into the lungs.Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2012年3月29日 · WALK WITH GRACE !! Stabilize the center of gravity which is at the center of your core. Move with purpose and control. Keep the belly muscles tight and let your pelvis move fluidly when you are walking. If you are somewhere where you believe no one can see you, have some fun and exagerate the swinging motion of your hips. If you walk like that in public, you'll probably get some looks and turn a few heads! HA! (And if you tell people, "Doc King told me to walk this way", I'll deny it.) In order to walk with grace and balance and control of our bodies we must be in command of our belly muscles. So, what are we supposed to do? That's right! You know what I'm saying ! SUCK IT IN !!Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2012年3月20日 · OK. So are we all sucking in our bellies? A lot? Great. Keep up the good work! Now it's time to connect the gut and the CORE. There's  that word again. Remember the little jelly ball inside the discs? The original core? Well, it just so happens that the human body CENTER of GRAVITY ( CoG) is a point which lies about 1 inch in front of the very bottom disc in the spine - L5. This point, this center of gravity, is truly the core of the core. That point is your gyroscope. ALL bo...dy motion takes place around it. The brain is constantly focused on the CoG and it issues millions of orders and directions to your bodies hundreds of muscles in response to every single tiny little change in position of the CoG. When you are engaged in SUCKING IT IN, think about that little point deep inside. Imagine, as you walk, that you are keeping it floating very smoothly. To do this means you MUST control the gut muscles. It also means that you must move and walk with GRACE. That's Right ! I said GRACE ! Walk with grace. Walk with balance. Walk with control. Walk with purpose. If you do these things, you can proudly tell anyone who asks why it is that you seem to look so much better lately, that you have been doing a whole lot of CORE exercise. Whether or not you let them think you are going to a gym, or have a personal trainer, well, that's up to you. 展开Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2012年3月14日 · Is it time to start on those New Years resolutions to get in better shape? Can't use "the weather" as an excuse to postpone the exercise efforts when we are having 70 degrees and sunshine in the middle of March. Take a walk! Take a fast walk! You would be amazed at how much ground you can cover in 20 minutes if you move like you need to get somewhere in a hurry. Walk 10 minutes in one direction, turn around and return home. Do it while the evening news is on TV. That way you can not only improve your general physical health, but you will miss the headlines and the stock market report which should also improve your mental health.Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2012年3月11日 · Wow !! What a beautiful day it was today !! Even though we had the most mild winter in my memory ( which is getting VERY long), it is always great to feel the sun and warm air on your face for the first time in months. Very good for the body, the mind , and the soul. It makes me anxious to get to work tomorrow and spread around some healing.Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2012年3月8日 · Is everyones gut a little sore this evening? No, you say? Then you did not SUCK IT IN enough today. Plant the thought firmly in the forefront of your mind and practice, practice, practice. Put a post-it on the bathroom mirror to remind you. And, all you flat-bellied folks out there? Don't be so smug as to think that your belly is great because it does not hang way out taking up extra space. You are no less obligated than the rest of us to firm up and straighten up ! Bill and Betty, you are more than welcome!Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2012年3月8日 · I am asked a lot about which abdominal/belly/core exercise is the best. The answer is simple: SUCK YOUR GUT IN !!! Unless you are working out to compete in some body beautiful contest, one of the main purposes of ab exercise is to make your belly leaner and to make it easier to SUCK IT IN !!! Do it all the time, not just when that cute girl or good looking guy walks by. Do it when standing, sitting, walking, even lying down. Do it everywhere. It is a key factor in good posture. It is a great way to burn calories. It will be a big help in your effort to reduce the volume of food you consume. Like anything else, it is a habit that is developed over time. It requires conscious effort, but, in time, it becomes second nature. SUCK IT IN !!!Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2012年3月5日 · Posture, Posture, Posture !! Take a good look at it. Everybody else does. Whether we realize it or not, we judge others on many simple levels, including the general impression we get from just looking at them. You may get a generally negative feeling or impression and not even know why. Chances are high that their poor posture has left you with that feeling. Conversely, observing people and being left with a positive impression is likely due to their good posture. Good posture coveys an air of strength, confidence, intelligence, even beauty. All this about how you look? Absolutely!Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2012年3月3日 · As you have correctly surmised, I posted from my wifes FB page. I swear, I need a full time IT wizard to keep me pointed in the right direction! HA ! Sue is it. Anyway, back to CORE. No one, and I do mean NO ONE, in the health care business touches the human core quite the way the Chiropractic Physician touches it. ( Of course, spine surgeons can rightly say the same thing, but that is a topic for another lesson.) You can exercise and stretch all day every day and never really duplicate chiropractic vertebral adjustive and manipulative procedures. It really amounts to a massive stimulation of the nervous system and brain, the spinal column, the notochord, the true "core" of our body. And very commonly, the response by the body generated from this stimulation of the core is nothing short of astounding.Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2012年2月27日 · Has it really been that long since I posted? If absence makes the heart grow fonder, then there must be a whole lotta fondness goin' on out there! Anyway, as we all know, "health care" is in the news a lot over the past couple years, especially since passage of the Affordable Health Care Act legislation. I believe most people recognize the real issues at work in this matter. It has nothing at all to do with health care. It has everything to do with money and control. Chiropractic is a big part of the solution. It is NOT part of the problem. It is now and always has been, by far, the best value in health care.Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2011年9月16日 · Chiropractic is an art, a science, and a philosophy. It functions on the basic truth that the human body has the innate capability to heal itself. Most of the time, anyway. At those times when it seems to be unable to do so, a chiropractic physician will intervene to stimulate the bodies healing power. The main reason chiropractic is so successful at this is because the body has such a powerful desire to be well. Some specific, well placed, hands on stimulation can enable the healing to proceed.Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2011年9月16日 · A little history of Chiropractic. The ancient practice of "bone setting" was rediscovered in Iowa in 1895 by Dr Daniel Palmer. An experimental manipulation of a vertebrae on a man who was partly deaf restored the hearing. This renewed the interest of this healing art and soon after a college was created to teach and study this science.Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2011年8月28日 · EAR INFECTIONS.The most important aspect of successful management of Otits Media is the education of parents on details of prevention and hygeine. They need to know these things so as to be better prepared to deal with the likely possibility that their child will be subject to ear infections. D.C.'s  utilize techniques which restore proper drainage of fluids from the middle ear. This is key to the successful resolution and prevention of ear infections. It is done without antibiotics or surgery.Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2011年8月28日 · EAR INFECTIONS. Another common chidhood illness. Often is recurring and frequent. Always is frustrating. Antibiotics are often ineffective and have their own set of negative side effects. Tympanostomy, or, ear tubes, in some cases, may be the only alternative left. Ear tubes allow drainage of fluids from infection and the pain of the condition is reduced. However, the infections continue full force  More parents are turning to chiropractic care for this condition and are having great success.Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2011年8月25日 · COLIC. A common infant malady. It is gut distress which some say a baby will grow out of. ( It can't happen soon enough for Mom ). Spinal manipulation has long been a source of relief for countless babies. The spinal column is a sophisticated electrical circuit system. If a vertebra's mechanics get compromised, the system malfunctions causing pain. D.C.'s know which vertebra is the "switch" for colic and how to reset it. How in the world does an infant, get a spinal bone stressed? You tell me!Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. 上传了 2 张新照片到相册：Office pics  June 30, 2011 。 · 2011年6月30日 · Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2011年6月30日 · Another great American holiday approaches. 245 years ago, our ancestors and the nations founders declared independence from tyrannical rulers and we became the United States of America. We live in the greatest nation that ever existed in the history of the entire world. We are the most positive force for all that is good in this world. Let us honor our Creator, love America and salute our flag!Kevin M. King, D.C., Inc. · 2011年6月24日 · To all who have been so good as to check in to our page and like it, Thank You! I have not had the time to move too far along on this new adventure in Facebook, but, will soon. My adorable wife, Sue, who I adore, and I, celebrated our 34th Wedding Anniversary today. How?, you may ask? By WORKING, that's how! 34 years of BLISS!! (or, is that BLISSters?) I Love Susan Lorraine Bernhoft King !更多

Gayle Guyardo: taking leap of faith to start new show with Kevin Harrington





January 13, 2010Full article here: http://blogs.tampabay.com/mediaGayle Guyardo quitting WFLA-Ch. 8 to start new talk show with Shark Tank star Kevin HarringtonMorning newscaster Gayle Guyardo is resigning from Tampa NBC affiliate WFLA-Ch. 8 at the end of February to develop a hybrid entertainment/advertorial daytime TV show with Clearwater-based infomercial king Kevin Harrington.Guyardo, who has worked at WFLA since 1993, said she has been developing the concept for about a year with Harrington, now appearing on ABC's unscripted show about entrepreneurs called Shark Tank.Their show, tentatively scheduled to launch in September, has the working title Access: Gayle.The concept is still in development, but Guyardo hopes the new show will balance feature stories on projects associated with Harrington's company with stories on interesting subjects she finds on her own. Harrington is the businessman behind products such as workout guru Tony Little's fitness gear and the Flo Bee haircutting attachment."We're going to try and blend our two worlds together...Kevin's a marketing genius and I have a passion for telling people's stories," said Guyardo, who had to turn down an automatic, yearlong extension of her contract at WFLA to take on this new concept. Her last day anchoring the station's morning show is Feb. 26."I don't want to be like Katie Couric...I don't know in my heart that I fit that evening news role," said Guyardo, who cited spending more time with her children and a more regular work schedule as two inspirations for trying this new venture. "I understand that I'm walking away from a popular show with lots of viewership...(but) I'm going to take a leap of faith."Harrington said the show speaks to the changing business model of daytime television. At a moment when heavyweights such as Oprah Winfrey and Tyra Banks are closing down their syndicated shows, programs featuring a mix of paid and unpaid subjects may be the new model, he said.But isn't Harrington trying to buy the credibility Guyardo established over 17 years at WFLA?"Ultimately, it does boil down to the credibility of the person, whether they're Rachael Ray or Gayle Guyardo," he said. "Eighty percent of our customers tend to be women, in the mid-40s age range. If they can identify with the person that's interviewing and recommending these products...well, that's Gayle Guyardo."Harrington points to product placement in unscripted  shows such as Celebrity Apprentice and Biggest Loser as inspirations, along with WFLA's mid-morning show Daytime and WTSP-Ch. 10's Studio 10 -- both local talk show which combine guests who have paid to appear with those who have not."When you watched Gayle on the morning news, you saw someone who was willing to get out there and play with products," he said, "That's what our business is all about; demonstration."The anchor's move comes at an interesting time for local television and WFLA. The station typically competes with Fox station WTVT-Ch. 13 for dominance in mornings, and relied on Guyardo as sole anchor when her longtime partner Bill Ratliff retired in June.A WFLA official declined to comment on the project, including who would replace Guyardo on the morning show, until an official announcement was released Thursday.Guyardo, a Plant high School graduate who hopes to cut a deal for WFLA to air her show locally, said she would offer a cheaper alternative for stations trying to offer unique daytime programming but unable to afford the high cost of programs featuring big stars."A big star costs big money," she said,. "I'm not looking at this to get rich. This is me trying to figure out how to stay in a business I love and think outside the box."

Shark Tank Deal Update!!





'Cactus Jack' Barringer trims 30 pounds, picks up $180G for 'Shark Tank'BY Christina BoyleDAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER He has peddled everything from dissolving cleaning tablets to "catch a lot" fish hooks.Yet infomercial star Jack (Cactus Jack) Barringer needed more than a gift of gab to get his latest invention on air - he had to shed some serious pounds, too.Investors told the Iowa TV salesman they would bankroll his pushup exercise machine - if he won his battle of the bulge.He stepped on the scales in New York Thursday 30 pounds lighter than he was in August, and walked away with a $180,000 check."My doctor wanted me to get rid of some weight. He said the No. 1 thing to do is pushups," said Barringer, 66, describing how he came up with his latest quirky invention. "I couldn't do one, and there wasn't a machine out there to help me, so I created one."Barringer appeared on ABC's "Shark Tank," where he pitched his business plan for the "Body Jac" to a panel of would-be investors, including New York real estate guru Barbara Corcoran and infomercial king Kevin Harrington.The two said they would give Barringer $180,000 - but only if he dropped from 273 pounds to 243 pounds."I thought, 'Nobody's going to buy that product when they see that big gut,'" Corcoran said."I believed he was going to make a success of it because he's great with promotion and there's a huge market for it."Barringer's Body Jac is made up of bars and rubber resistance bands that support the body during pushups.It can support 25% to 75% of a person's weight, so the resistance can be increased as he or she tones up."I wanted a way to do a pushup, but in the process realized there are millions of baby boomers just coming into retirement age and the bulk are like me: overweight [and] out of shape."His infomercial will air in January. The Body Jac will cost about $129, before hitting retail stores for $89.95.Barringer says he improved his diet, started walking more and used his Body Jac to shift the pounds."Not only am I going to keep it off, but I'm going to lose another 30 pounds," he said."When I do that infomercial, I'm going to be in my cowboy boots and hat and Speedos," he joked.Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/10/23/2009-10-23_cactus_jack_trims_30_pounds_picks_up_180g_to_push_new_gadget_no_gut__some_glory.html#ixzz0UyXkBLNN

Infomercial pitchman Kevin Trudeau has been ordered to jail after failing to 
pay a $38 million fine he received for misleading thousands of people with advertisements for  weight-loss books.In August, a federal judge sided with the Federal Trade Commission to hand over control of the presenter's assets and businesses to court-appointed official.Appearing before U.S. District Court Judge Robert Gettleman, Trudeau was found in contempt for violation of the asset freeze and receivership by transferring nearly $20,000 from an Australian account.     



Failure: Infomercial king Kevin Trudeau has been held in contempt of court for failing to pay $38million for defrauding customers with his natural cures
   										







According to Abc News he also used a debit card tied to that account to buy things beyond what is ordinary and necessary living expenses. In court today, he said: 'I thought I was following the order. I would ask the court to let me work with the receiver. I can be helpful.' Trudeau's lawyer Thomas Kirsch maintained, as his client and legal team have throughout the investigation into Trudeau's finances, that there 'isn't a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow' and that the receiver will not find hidden assets. But the judge rejected the pleas, saying 'This isn't an infomercial, Mr. Trudeau. You can't talk your way out of this one.'

After the judge's ruling, Trudeau was turned over to the custody of two U.S. Marshals and was then led out a side door of the courtroom and taken to the Metropolitan Correctional Center.He will spend at least a night there before the court-appointed official meet with him to determine his level of cooperation. The
 Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been after 50-year-old Trudeau, 
originally from Massachusetts, for several years after he made millions flogging what he claims are natural cures for serious and potentially fatal illnesses. The
 ruling at the end of last month was the latest round in more than a 
decade of legal battles that began with a suit filed by the Federal 
Trade Commission. Trudeau was slapped with a $38 million fine in 2011 after allegedly scamming customers for decades.   The FTC said that he has made millions of dollars by telling followers that coral calcium can cure cancer among other claims.   



Best-seller: Millions of people bought Trudeau's book which claimed that calcium could cure cancer and a product called Biotape would relieve severe pain
 FTC put the value at $37.6million as to 
how much consumers were defrauded by 'deceptive infomercials' that 
Trudeau filmed in order to plug his book - The Weight Loss Cure 'They' 
Don't Want You to Know About.In
 2007, Judge Robert Gettleman fined Trudeau $37.6 million for violating 
the order. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's 
decision that Trudeau must pay the huge fine.On July 26 of this year, Gettleman
 said Trudeau failed to pay and ordered him to transfer ownership of 
companies and financial accounts to a court-appointed receiver. Gettleman
 found him in contempt, opting not to give him jail time out of concern 
that those hurt by his actions would never get compensated.He likened Trudeau to a puppet master in control of a vast network being used to keep his assets hidden and suggested that without his cooperation there would be no way to get at that money.Despite no formal medical training and several criminal convictions, Trudeau has sold millions of books offering cures for dozens of ailments, from faltering memory to hair loss. DANGEROUS QUACK: THE FALSE PROMISES OF KEVIN TRUDEAU Kevin Trudeau made late-night infomercials for more that 20 years.Doctors have expressed concern in the past about his book Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About which has sold more than five million copies and appeared at the top of non-fiction bestseller lists.His claims include: 'The sun does not cause cancer. Sun block has been shown to cause cancer.'Another one of his statements is that Aids is 'one of the greatest hoaxes and deceptions ever perpetrated on the American public'.The FTC first came after Trudeau in 1998 for making false claims on TV. He claimed his alternative medicines could cause dramatic weight loss and cure addictions to alcohol, cigarettes and heroin. He even said the herbal remedies could give users a photographic memory.More than 25 million Americans have purchased products from Trudeau. 
On one episode of his radio show The Kevin Trudeau Show, he said: 'Coral calcium is the best form of calcium.'He then tells his listeners: 'Every single one of you are deficient in vitamin D3 and calcium.'If you take those two things, it's virtually impossible to get cancer and it's impossible to get sick.'They have titles such as The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About, the book at the center of his latest legal trouble.The FTC first sued Trudeau in 1998, charging that he made false and unsubstantiated claims in infomercials for hair growth, memory and weight-loss products. In 2003, the agency sued Trudeau for deceptively marketing a calcium product as a cancer cure and a product called Biotape as a pain reliever.Trudeau paid $2 million in 2004 to settle the FTC's charges and agreed to comply with a court order banning him from infomercials except those that accurately promote books.Three years later, the judge held Trudeau in civil contempt for misrepresenting some of the facts in an ad for his best-selling weight-loss book, namely that the diet plan was easy and allowed adherents to eat anything they wanted.After purchasing the book, however, the FTC alleged that consumers discover it 'requires severe dieting,' daily injections of a prescription drug not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for weight loss and 'lifelong dietary restrictions'.Trudeau's attorney, Kimball Anderson, said last month that his client wants to cooperate but does not own the companies and does not have the money.
