Prudential Financial, Inc. elects Sandra Pianalto to Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































Prudential Financial, Inc. elects Sandra Pianalto to Board of 
      Directors






June 09, 2015 04:07 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEWARK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) announced today that Sandra 
      Pianalto has been elected to the company’s Board of Directors as an 
      independent director, effective July 1, 2015.
    


      Pianalto is the former president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
      Cleveland, a position she held from February 2003 until May 2014.
    

      “Sandra served the Federal Reserve System during an extraordinary period 
      in our country’s economic history, helping to steer the Fourth District 
      through the financial crisis of 2008-09, and directing the Bank to focus 
      on both operational excellence and thought leadership,” said John 
      Strangfeld, chairman and CEO of Prudential Financial. “We are pleased to 
      welcome Sandra to our board, and we anticipate that our company will 
      benefit greatly from her insight and experience.”
    

      Pianalto’s tenure at the Bank spanned more than 30 years. She joined the 
      Bank in 1983 as an economist in the Research Department. She was 
      appointed assistant vice president of public affairs in 1984, vice 
      president and secretary to the board of directors in 1988, and first 
      vice president and chief operating officer in 1993. The Federal Reserve 
      Bank of Cleveland is one of twelve regional Reserve Banks that together 
      with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., comprise the Federal 
      Reserve System, the central bank of the United States. The Cleveland 
      Reserve Bank, which includes branch offices in Cincinnati and 
      Pittsburgh, serves the Fourth Federal Reserve District (Ohio, western 
      Pennsylvania, the northern panhandle of West Virginia, and eastern 
      Kentucky).
    

      In July 2014, Pianalto became an Executive-in-Residence in the College 
      of Business at the University of Akron, where she provides instruction 
      on the topics of monetary policy, banking and leadership.
    

      Before joining the Bank, Pianalto was an economist at the Board of 
      Governors of the Federal Reserve System and served on the staff of the 
      Budget Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives.
    

      Since July 2014, Pianalto has served on the board of the Eaton 
      Corporation, and has served on the board of the J.M Smucker Company 
      since August 2014.
    

      Pianalto earned an M.A. in economics from The George Washington 
      University and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Akron.
    

      Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE: PRU), a financial services leader with 
      more than $1 trillion of assets under management as of March 31, 2015, 
      has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Latin America. 
      Prudential’s diverse and talented employees are committed to helping 
      individual and institutional customers grow and protect their wealth 
      through a variety of products and services, including life insurance, 
      annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds and investment 
      management. In the U.S., Prudential’s iconic Rock symbol has stood for 
      strength, stability, expertise and innovation for more than a century.

Sandra Pianalto, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland, projected real gross domestic product to decline sharply in the first half of 2009, followed by a modest upturn in the second half.
COLUMBUS — The U.S. economy likely will show signs of recovery this year, a federal reserve official said Wednesday.

Sandra Pianalto, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland, projected real gross domestic product to decline sharply in the first half of 2009, followed by a modest upturn in the second half.
But she also warned that unemployment rates will likely continue to rise this year and that the economic outlook will be similar to 2008. 
"Unfortunately, I don't expect this to get better until we see stability returning into housing and financial markets," Pianalto said in a speech to commercial developers.
Her comments came a day after James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, warned that the U.S. might suffer a dangerous bout of falling prices, or deflation. A widespread and prolonged price decline can drag wages and clobber already-stricken home and stock prices.
Pianalto said housing prices are still declining in many parts of the country, and the U.S. must address foreclosures and other problems to restore economic vitality.
President Barack Obama on Thursday released details of a $75 billion program aimed at preventing up to 9 million Americans from losing their homes.
One part of the plan will ease refinancing for people who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are currently worth. Another provides incentives for mortgage lenders to help those on the verge of foreclosure.
Pianalto said the Fed, which already has cut interest rates to the bone, also is trying to stimulate the economy with programs designed to extend credit for commercial banks, invigorate the securities market and boost the flow of credit to home buyers.

Former Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank CEO Sandra Pianalto joins J.M. Smucker's board of directors



00SANDY
        
            Sandra Pianalto, former president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, was overwhelmingly elected to the board of directors of the J.M. Smucker Co. in Orrville on Wednesday. Her election means that half the independent directors on Smucker's board are women.

ORRVILLE, Ohio -- Sandra Pianalto, past president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, was elected by shareholders to J.M. Smucker Co.'s 13-member board of directors on Wednesday.
View full sizeVince Byrd, J.M. Smucker President and COOJ.M. Smucker 
Three other board members were also elected to one-year terms that expire at next summer's annual shareholders meeting: Smucker President and Chief Operating Officer Vincent Byrd, a director since 1999; Elizabeth Valk Long, former executive vice president of Time Inc., and a director since 1997; and Mark T. Smucker, Smucker's president of U.S. retail coffee business, a fifth-generation member of the Smucker family, and a board member since 2009.
Pianalto, who retired from the Cleveland Fed in May, replaces outgoing board member R. Douglas Cowan, who has served on Smucker's board since 2003 and whom Chief Executive Richard Smucker called "a trusted advisor, a mentor to me, and a dear friend."
She worked with Richard Smucker on the Federal Reserve Bank board and is the fourth woman among Smucker's eight independent directors on the board. 
Corporate boards are under greater scrutiny to better reflect their customers and U.S. consumers as a whole, including by shareholders like the woman in the audience Wednesday who asked why nearly all the people on the stage were men.
Brande Stellings, vice president of Corporate Board Services for Catalyst Inc., which takes a annual census of women on corporate boards, noted during a recent panel that "Women and minorities make up 70 percent of the U.S. population, but there are only two Fortune 500 company boards with that composition: Avon and Procter & Gamble."
Heidi Goldstein, a partner at Thompson Hine law firm and co-founder of the firm's Women's Initiative, said at that same event that: "For the eighth year in a row, there was no significant change in the number of female members of corporate boards, with women holding 16.9 percent of board seats in 2013, versus 16.6 percent" in 2012.
View full sizeMark Smucker, J.M. Smucker's president of U.S. retail coffeeJ.M. Smucker Co. 
In its proxy statement to shareholders, Smucker's board said it was nominating Pianalto "primarily due to her vast experience in monetary policy and financial services and her experience serving as a director of other non-profit boards."
"Specifically, Ms. Pianalto brings leadership and operating skills through her former roles with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland," the board said. "As the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, she oversaw 950 employees in Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh who conducted economic research, supervised financial institutions, and provided payment services to banks and the U.S. Treasury. Ms. Pianalto's background enables her to provide valuable insights to the Board, particularly in overseeing the Company's finances."
Noting that several companies have asked Pianalto to join their boards, board Chairman Tim Smucker said: "We are privileged that she wishes to serve on our board."
Pianalto was also recently elected to the board of Eaton Corp., the power management company announced on July 22. 
"Her strong leadership skills and extensive finance and economics background will be a tremendous asset to our board and shareholders," Eaton Chairman and Chief Executive Alexander M. Cutler said at the time.

Pianalto, who had joined the Federal Reserve Bank in 1983 as an economist in the research department, became president and chief executive in 2003. Before that, she was an economist at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and was on the staff of the Budget Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to Eaton.
She has a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Akron and a master's in economics from George Washington University. She was also recently named as a guest lecturer in banking at the University of Akron's College of Business Administration.
Pianalto is vice chair of the board of University Hospitals, a life director on the board of United Way of Greater Cleveland, an advisory trustee for the University of Akron, and serves on the boards of The Greater Cleveland Partnership, Team Northeast Ohio, and College Now Greater Cleveland.
Ann Harlan, chief executive of Harlan Peterson Partners LLC and former Vice President and General Counsel for the J.M. Smucker Co., recently said of Pianalto's election that for consumer product companies like Smucker whose sales depend on women, "knowing how they think and making sure their voices are in the room is very important," she said.
